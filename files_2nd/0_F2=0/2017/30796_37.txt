The blended tax rate is calculated using each subsidiary company's headline tax rate as a proportion of its respective profit.
The Group's tax charge includes a credit of 32.1m in relation to certain items as detailed in Notes 2 and 3.
Excluding these adjustments the tax on profit and the effective tax rate are 66.7m and 29.1% respectively.
A reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1st January 2018, was enacted as part of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22nd December 2017.
As a result the US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 have been calculated based on the future blended federal and state tax rate, with a federal tax element of 21%.
This results in a deferred tax credit to the Consolidated Income Statement of 24.4m: this is included within the overall credit of 32.1m.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% on 1st April 2017.
A further reduction to 17% effective from 1st April 2020 was substantially enacted on 15th September 2016.
This will reduce the Group's future current tax charge accordingly.
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 have been calculated based upon rates of 19% and 17% in respect of deferred tax expected to reverse before 1st April 2020 and after this date respectively.
The Group is aware of the on-going review by the European Commission into the UK Controlled Foreign Company CFC rules that exempts certain transactions by multinational groups from a full CFC apportionment.
Due to the uncertainty of the outcome of this review no provision for any UK corporation tax has been recognised at the date of the Statement of Financial Position, however the potential contingent liability is estimated at approximately 4.5m.
No UK tax after double tax relief for underlying tax is expected to be payable on the future remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
The effective tax rate is calculated as a percentage of profit before tax and share of profit of Associate.

2017 2016 Goodwill Goodwill m m Chromalox 170.2 Gestra 95.8 Aflex 27.1 27.1 Other cash-generating units 58.2 61.4 Total goodwill 351.3 88.5 The goodwill balance has been tested for annual impairment on the following basis: the carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows based on forecast information for the next financial year and in the case of recent acquisitions on detailed five-year forecasts.
This information has been approved by the Board: the key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows: pre-tax discount rates range from 10-16% 2016: 11-17% : short-term growth rates vary between 2-8% depending on detailed forecasts 2016: 2-26%.
The short-term is defined as not more than five years: and long-term growth rates are set using IMF forecasts and vary between 0.85.0% 2016: 0.8-5.0%.
As a result of this exercise an impairment of 3.2m was recognised in respect of Spirax Sarco Colombia.
No other impairments were identified.
The principal value in use assumptions for the three largest goodwill balances were as follows: Pre-tax Short-term Long-term Cash-generating unit discount rate growth rate growth rate Chromalox 10.8% 3.1-6.2% 2.5% Gestra 11.4% 0.6-5.6% 2.5% Aflex 10.3% 8.0% 2.5% Where applicable sensitivity analysis shows that if pre-tax discount rates are raised by 1% and short and long term growth rates are lowered by 1% no impairment would arise.
The 1% sensitivity threshold is considered a reasonable estimate of possible change.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 2.7m 2016: 1.5m.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 5.7m 2016: 1.2m as it is not considered probable that there will be future taxable profits available against which the relevant deduction can be offset.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of nil 2016: 0.1m that will expire by 2023.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax of 5.6m recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income page 122 comprises 5.1m associated with the remeasurement of defined benefit obligations and 0.5m relating to exchange movements.
As a result, the US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 have been calculated based on the future blended federal and state tax rate, with a federal tax element of 21%.
This results in a reduction in the net deferred tax liability of 21.9m of which 24.4m has been recognised as a credit in the income statement and 2.5m recognised as a debit in OCI.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 145 Corporate Information Financial Statements Governance Report Strategic Report Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24 Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements, which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting Income Statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the Income Statement totalled 10.9m 2016: 9.3m.
In the UK, following the closure ofthe defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit arrangements The Group operates several funded defined benefit retirement schemes where the benefits are based on employees length of service.
Whilst the Groups primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material benefit schemes in the USA as well as less material schemes elsewhere.
In funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the countries concerned.
UK defined benefit arrangements The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for approximately half of the Groups net liability for defined retirement benefit schemes.
Spirax-Sarco operates three UK schemes: the Spirax-Sarco Employees Pension Fund, the Spirax-Sarco Executives' Retirement Benefits Scheme and the Watson-Marlow Pension Fund.
These are all final salary pension schemes.
The UK schemes are closed to new members but are open to future accrual.
There is a mix of different inflation-dependent pension increases in payment and deferment which vary from member to member according to their membership history and which scheme they are a member of.
All three schemes have been set up under UK law and are governed by a Trustee committee, which is responsible for the schemes investments, administration and management.
A funding valuation is carried out for the Trustees of each scheme every three years by an independent firm of actuaries.
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated with Spirax Sarco.
Further information on the contribution commitments is shown in the Financial Review on pages 50 to 51.
US defined benefit schemes The Group operates a pension scheme in the USA which is closed to new entrants but open to future accrual and defines the pension in terms of the highest average pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement.
No pension increases in payment and deferment are offered by this scheme.
It also operates a post-retirement medical plan in the USA, which is unfunded, as is typical for these plans.
Principal risks The pension schemes create a number of risk exposures.
Annual increase in benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension schemes.
All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions.
These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact on the Groups pension schemes.
The IAS 19 liability measurement known as Defined Benefit Obligation DBO and the Service Cost are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments, the most important of these assumptions being the future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation.
The DBO and Service Cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit payments.
The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of DBO.
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 DBO may be volatile.
Sensitivity analysis to changes in discount rate and inflation are included on page 149.

Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee whose objective was to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value.
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
For options granted before 2007 the performance condition is an increase in earnings per share EPS of more than 9% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant.
From 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the threeyear period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three-year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.

Performance Share Plan Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares.
The performance criteria is split into two separate parts.
For awards granted from 2014 40% of the award is based on a TSR measure where the performance target is based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale.
All shares within an award will vest if the Companys TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Companys TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median.
For awards granted from 2014 the second part, amounting to 60% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period.
25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.
Awards made prior to 2014 had a weighting of 60% TSR and 40% EPS.
From 2015 a change has been made to measure EPS on a point to point basis over the three-year performance period.
From 2016 EPS growth is measured against the growth of global industrial production IP, as published by CHR Economics with thresholds of plus 2% and plus 8%.
Shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan have been valued using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology.

The aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions.
Employees are invited to join the ESOP when an offer is made each year.
Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules.
The Company provides a matching share for each share purchased by the individual.
Shares issued under the ESOP have been measured using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.

28 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Credit risk The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector.
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans, facilities and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1.0 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months and 60% of the following 12 months forecast exposure.

Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments.
Financial instruments fair value disclosure Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into Level 2.

156 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements 28 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Currency exposures As explained on page 154, the Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31st December 2017 the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary liability of 191.3m 2016: 3.4m net monetary asset and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary liability of 101.1m 2016: net monetary asset 16.6m.
At 31st December 2017, the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 30% 2016: nil for the euro, 11% 2016: nil for theUS dollar 1% 2016: 3% for the Chinese renminbi and nil 2016: 1% for Japanese yen.

The forward contracts are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship.
At 31st December 2017 the Group had contracts outstanding to purchase 1.2m 2016: nil, and 0.5m 2016: nil with US dollars, 1.5m 2016: 1.0m with Danish krone, 3.8m 2016: 8.4m with euros, nil 2016: 0.3m with Japanese yen, 0.6m 2016: 0.2m with Korean won, 0.2m 2016: 0.1m with Canadian dollars and nil 2016: 0.1m with Czech koruna.
The fair values at the end of the reporting period were an asset of 0.2m 2016: 0.2m asset.
The fair value of cash flow hedges falls into the Level 2 category of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using readily available market data.
The contractual cash flows on forward currency contracts at the reporting date are shown on page 158, classified by maturity.
The cash flows shown are on a gross basis and are not discounted.

At this time the amount deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit or loss.
All forecast transactions which have been subject to hedge accounting during the year have occurred or are still expected to occur.
A profit on derivative financial instruments of 0.2m 2016: 0.4m was recognised in other comprehensive income during the period.
No amount 2016: nil was removed from equity during the period and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability whose acquisition or incurrence was a hedged highly probable forecast transaction.
As at 31st December 2017 no ineffectiveness has been recognised in profit or loss arising from hedging foreign currency transactions.
Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which allconditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2017 2016 m m Expiring in one year or less 39.9 14.6 Expiring in more than one year but no more than two years 70.0 52.0 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three years Expiring in more than three years Total Group undrawn committed facilities 109.9 66.6 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short-term rates of interest.
Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market by discounting the future contracted cash flows using readily available market data.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
158 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2017 Financial Statements 28 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At the year end borrowings totalled 525.7m 2016: 91.8m.
At 31st December 2017, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit after tax and equity by approximately 1.5m 2016: nil.
For the year ended 31st December 2017, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the Groups profit and trading flows would have increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.8m 2016: 1.5m.
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements.
Forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
The credit risk profile of trade receivables The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m Not past due date 153.7 0.4 124.1 0.3 030 days past due date 43.0 0.1 35.5 3190 days past due date 25.6 0.5 19.1 0.4 91 days to one year past due date 15.2 1.5 10.8 3.3 More than one year 9.6 7.1 8.2 8.2 Group total 247.1 9.6 197.7 12.2 Based on past experience, the Group believes no further impairment allowance is required for receivables that are past their due date.
