Taxation continued What are our unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences?
At 31 March 2017 we had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 4.5bn 2015 16: 4.1bn.
Our other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
Asummary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: At 31 March 2017 m Expiry Restricted losses Europe 19 20182026 Americas 220 20212036 Total restricted losses 239 Unrestricted operating losses 3,961 No expiry Other temporary differences 173 No expiry Total 4,373 At 31 March 2017 we had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 17.0bn 2015 16: 17.0bn.
These losses have no expiry date, but we consider the future utilisation of these losses to be remote.
At 31 March 2017 the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were 3.5bn 2015 16: 3.3bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise.
Under current tax rules, tax of 26.2m 2015 16: 23.1m would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.
On 29 March 2017, the UK Government notified the EU of its intention to withdraw membership from the EU.
Depending on the outcome of negotiations we could cease to benefit from the EU Parent Subsidiary directive on dividends paid by our EU subsidiaries.
In this event, additional tax of up to 17.7m could arise if the undistributed earnings of EU subsidiaries of 619m were to be repatriated to the UK.
Earnings per share How are earnings per share calculated?
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the own shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.
Options over 27m shares 2015 16: 15m shares, 2014 15: 13m shares were excluded from the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is antidilutive.
Year ended 31 March 2017 2016 2015 Basic weighted average number of shares millions 9,938 8,619 8,056 Dilutive shares from share options millions 27 58 80 Dilutive shares from executive share awards millions 29 37 55 Diluted weighted average number of shares millions 9,994 8,714 8,191 Basic earnings per share 19.2p 28.5p 25.5p Diluted earnings per share 19.1p 28.2p 25.1p The earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company which excludes non-controlling interests.
Profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company was 1,908m 2015 16: 2,466m, 2014 15: 2,057m and profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interests was 1m 2015 16: 7m, 2014 15: nil.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests is not presented separately in the financial statements as it is not material.
