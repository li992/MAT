Financial risk management Interest rate and foreign exchange risk management The Company manages its exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements, which arise from the Companys sources of finance by selectively entering into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure.
The Company has also entered into derivative contracts on behalf of its subsidiary Sky Group Finance plc, and has back-to-back intercompany contracts.
Foreign exchange risk The following analysis details the Companys sensitivity to movements in pounds sterling against all currencies in which it has significant transactions.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated financial instruments and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 25% change in foreign currency rates.
A 25% strengthening in pounds sterling against the US dollar would have an adverse impact on profit of 5 million 2016: adverse impact of 10 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same strengthening would have an adverse impact on other equity of 40 million 2016: adverse impact of 68 million.
A 25% weakening in pounds sterling against the US dollar would have a beneficial impact on profit of 9 million 2016: beneficial impact of 17 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same weakening would have a beneficial impact on other equity of 67 million 2016: beneficial impact of 113 million.
A 25% strengthening in pounds sterling against the euro would have a beneficial impact on profit by 27 million 2016: beneficial impact of 38 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuations of derivatives.
The same strengthening would have an adverse impact on other equity of 12 million 2016: adverse impact of 16 million.
A 25% weakening in pounds sterling against the euro would have an adverse impact on profit of 45 million 2016: adverse impact of 63 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same weakening would have a beneficial impact on other equity of 19 million 2016: beneficial impact of 27 million.
Interest rate risk The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
For each one hundred basis point rise or fall in interest rates at 30 June 2017, and if all other variables were held constant, the Companys profit for the year ended 30 June 2017 would decrease or increase by 6 million 2016: decrease or increase by 10 million and other equity reserves would decrease or increase by 22 million 2016: decrease or increase by 26 million.
A one hundred basis point rise or fall in interest rates represents a large but realistic movement which can easily be multiplied to give sensitivities at different interest rates.
The sensitivity analyses provided are hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash flows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the Company.
In addition, the Companys actual exposure to market rates changes as the Companys portfolio of debt changes.
The changes in valuations are estimates of the impact of changes in market variables and are not a prediction of future events or anticipated gains or losses.
