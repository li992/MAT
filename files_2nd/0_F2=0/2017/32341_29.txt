Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 149 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information 16 Earnings per share a Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust and treasury shares which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing and discontinued operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following: i Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2017 2016 restated m m Profit for the period attributable to owners of the company 342.8 330.0 Adjusted for profit from discontinued operations see note 40 13.6 14.9 Profit for the period from continuing operations attributable to owners of the company 329.2 315.1 ii Number of shares 2017 2016 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 235.0 236.1 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options and LTIPs 1.0 1.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 236.0 237.2 b Underlying earnings per share 2017 2016 restated pence pence Underlying basic earnings per share 122.4 102.1 Underlying diluted earnings per share 121.9 101.6 The directors consider that underlying earnings per share provides a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of underlying basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted figures set out above.
The adjustments to earnings that are made in calculating adjusted earnings per share are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 329.2 315.1 Adjustments for: exceptional items before tax 18.6 1.0 current tax related to exceptional items 0.1 0.2 net losses gains on financial instruments 1.8 7.7 current tax on net losses gains on financial instruments 4.9 0.2 exceptional current tax 16.4 deferred tax 13.4 64.9 Earnings for the purpose of underlying basic and diluted earnings per share 287.6 241.1 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 150 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2017 17 Goodwill 2017 2016 m m Cost At 1 April 18.2 17.7 Acquisition of Dee Valley Water 66.0 Disposal of Operating Services Italy 5.4 Exchange adjustments 2.2 0.5 At 31 March 81.0 18.2 Impairment At 1 April 3.4 3.4 Disposal of Operating Services Italy 3.4 At 31 March 3.4 Net book value at 31 March 81.0 14.8 Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation by CGU is presented below.
2017 2016 m m Dee Valley Water 66.0 Operating Services US 15.0 13.0 Operating Services Italy 1.8 81.0 14.8 The group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2 l. The value in use calculation for the Dee Valley Water CGU is based on the financial model used in the acquisition but restricted to the remaining three years of the current AMP.
The key assumptions underlying this model are: RPI inflation in the final three years of the AMP, the operating cost efficiencies achieved and the growth rate beyond the three year period.
The discount rate of 4.7% was based on an estimate for the weighted average cost of capital at the year end date based on the market rate for the cost of debt and the cost of equity included in the Dee Valley Water Final Determination for AMP6.
The equivalent pre-tax rate discount rate is 5.9%.
Cash flows beyond the end of the three year period are extrapolated using an estimate of 2% for long term CPI and zero real growth.
The value in use calculations for Operating Services US use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period.
The key assumptions underlying these budgets are revenue growth and margin.
Management determines assumptions based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate of 3.0% 2016: 3.0%.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates and is consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
Specific discount rates for Operating Services US are not available and hence a post tax discount rate of 3.5% 2016: 4.7% reflecting risks relating to the CGU has been estimated and used to calculate the value in use of the CGU from its post tax cash flow projections.
The equivalent pre-tax discount rate is 4.4% 2016: 5.9%.
Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash flows may cause a CGUs carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
However, in the opinion of the directors, the changes in growth rate or discount rate that would be required to reduce the recoverable amount of the CGUs below their carrying value are not reasonably possible.
Therefore nosensitivity analysis has been presented.

The defined benefit pension schemes cover increases in accrued benefits arising from inflation and future pension increases.
Their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary.
Under the defined benefit pension schemes, members are entitled to retirement benefits calculated as a proportion varying between 1 30 and 1 80 for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of membership, up to 31 March 2015.
Dee Valley Water DVW participates in the Water Companies Pension Scheme, which is a defined benefit sectionalised scheme.
DVW participates in the Dee Valley Water plc Section of the scheme the Section.
The Section funds are administered by trustees and are held separately from the assets of the group.
Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an independent professionally qualified actuary, who carries out a formal actuarial valuation at triennial intervals.
Members are entitled to retirement benefits calculated by reference to their pensionable service and pensionable salary history.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income since the adoption of IFRS is a net loss of 622.0 million 2016: 310.8 million.
iv Actuarial risk factors The schemes typically expose the company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, inflation risk and longevity risk.
Investment risk The groups contributions to the schemes are based on actuarial calculations which make assumptions about the returns expected from the schemes investments.
If the investments underperform these assumptions in the long term then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benefits.
Inflation risk The benefits payable to members of the schemes are linked to inflation measured by the RPI.
The groups contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the future level of inflation.
If inflation is higher than the levels assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment ofaccrued benefits.
Longevity risk The groups contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the life expectancy of scheme members after retirement.
If scheme members live longer than assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group will need to make additional contributions tothe schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benefits.
v Actuarial assumptions The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS and STMIPS schemes were as follows: 2017 2016 % % Price inflation RPI 3.1 3.0 Price inflation CPI 2.1 2.0 Discount rate 2.7 3.6 Pension increases in payment 3.1 3.0 Pension increases in deferment 3.1 3.0 The assumption for price inflation is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term fixed rate gilts and on index-linked gilts.
We have revised our methodology for setting the discount rate to better reflect the credit risk for long dated bond yields where there is insufficient market data available.
We now adjust the yield on long dated gilts for the market-implied spread that would be expected for anAA bond of similar term.
Short dated yields are taken from market rates for AA corporate bonds.
We project the expected cash flows of the schemes and adopt a single equivalent cash flow weighted discount rate based on this constructed yield curve.
We estimate that the change in methodology increased the discount rate by 0.15% 0.2%.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 161 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information 29 Retirement benefit schemes continued a Defined benefit pension schemes continued v Actuarial assumptions continued The mortality assumptions are based on those used in the triennial valuation of the STPS as at 31 March 2016.
The mortality assumptions adopted at the year end and the life expectancies at age 65 implied by the assumptions are as follows for STPS and STMIPS: 2017 2016 Men Women Men Women SAPS Mortality table used S2NMA S2NFA S1NMA L S1NFA L Mortality table compared with standard table 95% 99% 116% 92% Future improvement per annum 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% Remaining life expectancy for members currently aged 65 years 22.5 24.1 21.4 24.6 Remaining life expectancy at age 65 for members currently aged 45 years 23.6 25.3 22.8 26.1 The assumptions used in the valuation of the DVWS scheme were as follows: 2017 Price inflation RPI 3.4% Price inflation CPI 2.4% Discount rate 2.5% Pension increases in payment uncapped CPI 2.5% Pension increases in payment CPI capped at 5% per annum 2.4% Pension increases in deferment 2.5% Pension salary increases capped at 2% per annum 1.9% Life expectancy of a male aged 60 at the balance sheet date years 27.9 years Life expectancy of a female aged 60 at the balance sheet date years 29.8 years Life expectancy of a male aged 60, twenty five years after the balance sheet date years 30.9 years Life expectancy of a female aged 60, twenty five years after the balance sheet date years 32.3 years The mortality table used to calculate the DVWS assumptions were SAPS S2NA 1.5% for men, 1.25% for women.
The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price inflation and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on STPS and STMIPS scheme liabilities from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 53 million Price inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 46 million Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 106 million The following table summarises the estimated impact on DVWS scheme liabilities from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 1 million Price inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 0.8 million Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 2 million The impact of pension increases is not material.
In reality, inter-relationships exist between the assumptions, particularly between the discount rate and price inflation.
The above analysis does not take into account the effect of these interrelationships.
As the STPS and STMIPS were closed to future accrual on 31 March 2015, pension increases are now linked to RPI inflation and there are no active members.
Therefore the assumption for pension increases is the same as the RPI assumption and the sensitivities are identical.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the year is 20 years for STPS and STMIPS 2016: 18 years and 17 years forDVWS.
The expected cash flows payable from the schemes are presented in the graph below: Expected benefit payments millions 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Year The most recent formal triennial actuarial valuations and funding agreements were carried out as at 31 March 2016 for the STPS and STMIPS schemes and 31 March 2014 for DVWS.
As a result of the STPS and STMIPS actuarial valuations, deficit reduction contributions of 10 million for the two financial years ending 31 March 2019 were agreed.
Payments of 8 million per annum through an asset backed funding arrangement will continue to 31 March 2032.
Further inflation linked payments of 15 million per annum will be made through a new asset backed funding arrangement, starting in the financial year ending 31 March 2018 and continuing to31 March 2031.
These contributions will cease earlier should a subsequent valuation of the STPS show thatthese contributions are no longer needed.
b Defined contribution pension schemes The group also operates defined contribution arrangements for certain of its UK employees.
The Severn Trent Pension Scheme, Choices section was replaced by the Severn Trent Group Personal Pension from 1 April 2015 and all members of other pension schemes were transferred.
This scheme has been open since 1 April 2012 and new employees were automatically enrolled from this date.
The total cost charged to operating costs of 21.2 million 2016: 19.2 million represents contributions payable to these schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
As at 31 March 2017, contributions amounting to 2.2 million 2015: 1.5 million in respect of the current reporting period were owed to the schemes.
Dee Valley Water operates two defined contribution pension schemes, neither of which were material in the current year.

The hedging reserve arises from gains or losses on interest rate swaps taken directly to equity under the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 and the transition rules of IFRS 1.
34 Capital management The groups principal objectives in managing capital are: to access a broad range of sources of finance to obtain both the quantum required and lowest cost compatible with the need for continued availability: to manage exposure to movements in interest rates to provide an appropriate degree of certainty as to its cost of funds: to minimise exposure to counterparty credit risk: to provide the group with an appropriate degree of certainty as to its foreign exchange exposure: to maintain an investment grade credit rating: and to maintain a flexible and sustainable balance sheet structure.
The group seeks to achieve a balance of long term funding or commitment of funds across a range of funding sources at the best possible economic cost.
The group monitors future funding requirements and credit market conditions to ensure continued availability of funds.
The group has continued to increase exposure to currently low floating interest rates, primarily through raising 400 million of finance through a bond with a maturity of 15 years.
The group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps in relation to this bond, to take advantage of low floating interest rates.
Whilst the group does not have a specific gearing target and seeks to maintain gearing at a level consistent with its capital management objectives described above, the group seeks to keep the net debt RCV gearing ratio broadly in line withOfwats notionalassumption of 62.5% for AMP6.
The groups dividend policy is a key tool in achieving its capital management objectives.
This policy is reviewed and updated in line with Severn Trent Waters five year price control cycle and takes into account, inter alia, the planned investment programme, the appropriate gearing level achieving a balance between an efficient cost of capital and retaining an investment grade credit rating and delivering an attractive and sustainable return to shareholders.
The board has decided to set the 2016 17 dividend at 81.50 pence, anincrease of 1% compared to the total dividend for 2015 16 of 80.66 pence.
In the light of our strong operational and financial performance wehave enhanced our policy and it is now to grow the dividend annually by at least RPI plus 4% until March 2020.

b Comparison of fair value of financial instruments with their carrying amounts The directors consider that the carrying amounts of cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts, loans receivable from joint ventures, trade receivables and trade payables approximate their fair values.
Fixed rate sterling and currency bonds are valued using market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation technique.
Index-linked bonds are rarely traded and therefore quoted prices are not considered to be a reliable indicator of fair value.
Therefore, these bonds are valued using discounted cash flow models with discount rates derived from observed market pricesforasample of bonds, which is a Level 2 valuation technique.
Fair values of the other debt instruments are also calculated using discounted cash flow models, which is a Level 2 valuation technique.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 166 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2017 36 Risks arising from financial instruments The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price risk : credit risk: liquidity risk: and inflation risk.
The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
The board has established a Treasury Management Committee to monitor treasury activities and to facilitate timely responses to changes in market conditions when necessary.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board defines written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading but may be used to mitigate the groups exposure to financial risk.
The types of derivative instruments held and the related risks are described below.
Interest rate swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to changes in market interest rates.
Further details are set out in section a i and note 37 b i.
Cross currency swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate movements on amounts borrowed in foreign currencies.
Further details are set out in section a ii and 37 a.
Energy swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to changes in electricity prices.
Further details are provided in note37b ii.
Severn Trent Water, the groups most significant business unit, operates under a regulatory environment where its prices are linked to inflation measured by RPI.
In order to mitigate the risks to cash flow and earnings arising from fluctuations in RPI, the group holds debt instruments where the principal repayable and interest cost is linked to RPI.
a Market risk The group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, exchange rates.
The nature of these risks and the steps that the group has taken to manage them are described below.
i Interest rate risk The groups income and its operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to the risk of adverse cash flow impacts from increases in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to the risk of interest costs above the market rate when interest rates decrease.
The groups policy is to maintain 40% to 70% of its interest bearing liabilities in fixed rate instruments during AMP6.
In measuring this metric, management makes adjustments to the carrying value of debt to better reflect the amount that interest is calculated on.
Details of the adjustments made are set out below: 2017 2016 m m Net debt note 42 5,082.4 4,823.4 Cash and cash equivalents 44.6 55.2 Loan receivable from joint venture 108.6 Cross currency swaps included in net debt at fair value 43.4 28.1 Fair value hedge accounting adjustments 31.5 15.2 Exchange adjustments on currency debt not hedge accounted 21.2 5.9 Interest bearing financial liabilities 5,226.3 4,885.6 The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by borrowing at fixed or index-linked rates or by using interest rate swaps.
Under these swaps the group receives variable rate interest and pays fixed rate interest calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
In practice the swaps are settled by transferring the net amount.
These swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from variable rates to fixed rates.
The group has entered into a series of these interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments beyond 2030.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 167 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information 36 Risks arising from financial instruments continued a Market risk continued i Interest rate risk continued The following tables show analyses of the groups interest bearing financial liabilities by type of interest.
Debt which is hedged by interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps is included in the category after taking account of the impact of the swap.
Debt raised in foreign currencies has been included at the notional sterling value of the payable leg of the corresponding cross currency swap since this is the amount that is exposed to changes in interest rates.
Valuation adjustments that do not impact the amount on which interest is calculated, such as fair value hedge accounting adjustments, are excluded from this analysis.
The net principal amount of unhedged swaps is shown as an adjustment to floating rate and fixed rate debt to demonstrate the impact of the swaps on the amount of liabilities bearing fixed interest.

Economically these swaps act to fix the interest cost of debt within the group which is denominated as floating rate and fixed rate debt, but they do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a charge of 3.3 million 2016: credit of 14.4 million in the income statement.

Although the group operates internationally and its net investments in foreign operations are subject to exchange risk, substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, and therefore the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates isnot material.
Certain of the groups subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
Exchange risks relating to such operations are not material but are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell currency.
These contracts led to a charge of 0.1 million 2016: credit of 0.2 million in the income statement.
In order to meet its objective of accessing a broad range of sources of finance, the group has raised debt denominated in currencies other than sterling.
In order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, it has entered into cross currency swaps to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR.
Where the terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt, the swaps are expected to be effective hedges, hence the swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges.
The notional value and fair value of these swaps isshown in note37 a.
The group also has cross currency swaps with a sterling value of 98.3 million 2016: 98.3 million which are not accounted for as fair value hedges.
Economically these swaps act to mitigate the exchange rate risk of debt within the group which is denominated in foreign currency, but they do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a credit of 13.1 million 2016:creditof 39.2 million in the income statement which is partly offset by the exchange loss of 15.4 million 2016:32.6 million onthe underlying debt.
The groups gross and net currency exposures arising from currency borrowings are summarised in the tables below.
These show, in the relevant currency, the amount borrowed and the notional principal of the related swap or forward contract.

It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges it to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 22.
Cash deposits and derivative contracts are only placed with high credit quality financial institutions, which have been approved by the board.
Group Treasury monitors the credit quality of the approved financial institutions and the list of financial institutions that may be used is approved annually by the board.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Credit risk analysis At 31 March the aggregate credit limits of authorised counterparties and the amounts held on short term deposits were as follows: Credit limit Amount deposited 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m AAA 5.0 5.0 1.2 1.2 Double A range 100.0 100.0 1.8 14.4 Single A range 625.0 615.0 13.9 14.1 Triple B range 10.0 20.0 2.0 2.1 740.0 740.0 18.9 31.8 The fair values of derivative assets analysed by credit ratings of counterparties were as follows: Derivative assets 2017 2016 m m Double A range 0.8 Single A range 66.2 33.0 Triple B range 7.9 67.0 40.9 c Liquidity risk i Committed facilities Prudent liquidity management requires sufficient cash balances to be maintained: adequate committed facilities to be available: and the ability to close out market positions.
Group Treasury manages liquidity and flexibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities, and by keeping committed credit lines available.
At the balance sheet date the group had committed undrawn borrowing facilities expiring as follows: 2017 2016 m m 2 5 years 1,000.0 875.0 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 170 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2017 36 Risks arising from financial instruments continued c Liquidity risk continued ii Cash flows from non-derivative financial instruments The following tables show the estimated cash flows that will arise from the groups non-derivative net financial liabilities.
The information presented is based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay and represents the undiscounted cash flows including principal and interest.
Interest and inflation assumptions are based on prevailing market conditions at the year end date.
The principal is revalued at fixed intervals and is linked to movements in RPI.
Interest payments are made biannually based on the revalued principal.
The principal repayment equals the revalued amount at maturity.
The payments included in the table above are estimates based on the forward inflation rates published by the Bank of England at the balance sheet date.

The tables are based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates derived from the forward curves existing at the balance sheet date.

Its operating profits and cash flows are therefore exposed to changes in RPI.
In order to mitigate and partially offset this risk, Severn Trent Water has raised debt which pays interest at a fixed coupon based on a principal amount that is adjusted for the change in RPI during the life of the debt instrument index-linked debt.
The amount of index-linked debt at the balance sheet date is shown in section a i Interest rate risk, and the estimated future cash flows relating to this debt are shown in section c ii Cash flows from non-derivative financial instruments.
Inflation rate sensitivity analysis The finance cost of the groups index-linked debt instruments varies with changes in RPI rather than interest rates.
The sensitivity at 31 March of the groups profit and equity to changes in RPI is set out in the following table.
This analysis relates to financial instruments only and excludes any RPI impact on Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulatory Capital Value, or accounting for defined benefit pension schemes.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
a Fair value hedges i Cross currency swaps The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Cross currency swaps are entered into to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
Where the terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt, the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Euro 11.4 11.4 10.4 9.8 Yen 8.5 8.5 9.4 7.9 19.9 19.9 19.8 17.7 ii Interest rate swaps Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Period to maturity % % m m m m 10 20 years 3.36% 225.0 12.1 Hedge accounting for swaps previously designated in fair value hedging relationships have been discontinued, as they no longer meet the criteria set out in IAS 39.
These swaps continue to economically increase the portion of debt within the group at floating rates.
b Cash flow hedges i Interest rate swaps The group has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on future cash flow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
Where the hedge is expected to be highlyeffective these interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
Details of interest rate swaps that have been accounted for as cash flow hedges are summarised below: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Period to maturity % % m m m m 5 10 years 1.70% 50.0 1.1 10 20 years 2.14% 5.18% 384.4 38.1 19.6 10.3 2.09% 5.18% 434.4 38.1 20.7 10.3 ii Energy swaps The group has entered into a series of energy swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and market prices of electricity at six-monthly intervals up to March 2020.

The weighted average share price during the period was 22.98 2016: 21.44.
At 31 March 2017, there were no options exercisable 2016: none under any of the share based remuneration schemes.
a Long Term Incentive Plans LTIPs Under the LTIPs, conditional awards of shares may be made to executive directors and senior staff.
Awards are subject to performance conditions and continued employment throughout the vesting period.

Matching shares may be awarded at a maximum ratio of one matching share for every deferred share and are subject to a three-year vesting period.
No matching shares have been awarded in the current year.
Matching shares are subject to total shareholder return over three years measured relative to the companies ranked 51 150 by market capitalisation in the FTSE Index excluding investment trusts.
The number of shares subject to an award will increase to reflect dividends paid through the performance period on the basis of such notional dividends being reinvested at the then prevailing share price.
Awards will normally vest as soon as the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met provided that the participant remains in employment at the end of the performance period.

39 Acquisitions On 15 February 2017, Severn Trent Water Limited acquired 100% of the issued ordinary share capital of Dee Valley Group plc and all of its subsidiaries including the regulated water company Dee Valley Water plc.
This acquisition was made through a scheme of arrangement under which Severn Trent Water Limited paid for total consideration of 84.2 million, comprising 79.0 million in cash and 5.2 million in loan notes redeemable on demand.
The acquisition represents an opportunity for the group to deliver attractive returns to its shareholders through applying its successful operating model across an enlarged asset base, in a contiguous geographic area.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill of 66.0 million has been capitalised attributable to the anticipated future synergies and outperformance arising as a result of the acquisition.
No goodwill related to these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

No other acquisition costs were recognised.
40 Discontinued operations Water Plus joint venture On 1 March 2016 the group announced its intention, subject to approval from the Competition and Markets Authority CMA, to enter into a joint venture with United Utilities PLC to compete in the non-household water and waste water retail markets in England and Scotland.
On 3 May 2016 the CMA announced approval of the joint venture.
On this date the group determined that completion of the proposed transaction became highly probable and the non-household retail business was classified as a disposal group and discontinued operation with effect from this date.
On 31 May 2016 the group transferred Severn Trent Waters non-household retail business to Severn Trent Select Limited and on 1 June it exchanged the entire share capital of Severn Trent Select Limited for 50% of the share capital of Water Plus.
Water Purification disposal On 23 January 2015 the board approved a process to dispose of the groups Water Purification business which formed part of the Business Services segment.
On 12 May 2015 the group entered into a binding agreement to sell the business to Industrie fide Nora S. p. A.
The sale was completed on2 July 2015.
