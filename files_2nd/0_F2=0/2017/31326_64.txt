Financial instruments The table below sets out the categorisation of the financial instruments held by the Group at 31 December 2017.
The carrying amount of all financial instruments, other than those for which a valuation level has been given below, approximates to their fair values.
Where the financial instruments are held at fair value the valuation level indicates the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.

These risks include market risk including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to economically hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board and management on a continuous basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Groups management reports quarterly to the Board and bi-annually to the Audit Committee, an independent body that monitors risks and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: interest rate swaps and caps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates: and forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro as their functional currency.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups exposure to foreign currency arises from the fact that there are foreign operations which transact business denominated in Euro, with the translation of the local trading performance and local net asset to Sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date giving rise to an exposure to fluctuations in the Sterling: Euro exchange rate.
The Groups approach to managing this exposure is to fund investments in Euro-denominated operations with equity and Euro-denominated debt that is partly hedged by forward currency options to limit the overall exposure of the Group.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated financial instruments at the reporting date are as follows.
The carrying amount of the Groups non-financial instruments in Euro-denominated operations is also presented.

This exposure has decreased significantly during the year subsequent to the disposal of the German and Dutch portfolio.
At 31 December 2017 the net assets of the Group were 557.5 million 2016: 924.2 million of which 49.6 million were denominated in Euros 2016: 518.5 million.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had no currency options in place to buy Sterling for an agreed amount of Euros 2016: 42.2 million for 67.5 million.

Group Group Company Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Increase foreign exchange rates by 10% Increase in profit before tax 2.1 3.6 1.4 1.9 Increase in other comprehensive income 1.5 37.6 Decrease foreign exchange rates by 10% Decrease in profit before tax 2.7 4.2 1.8 2.1 Decrease in other comprehensive income 1.9 46.0 Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and interest rate capcontracts.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments during the year.
Increase decrease in profit before tax: Company Group Group Company 2016 2017 2016 2017 m m m m Increase interest rates by 1% 1.5 3.4 0.7 0.5 Decrease interest rates by 1% 1.5 3.4 0.4 1.4 There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
Interest rate swap and cap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Under interest rate cap contracts, the Group has limited its exposure to increases in interest rates by capping interest payable on its borrowings.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is 88.5 million 2016: 107.3 million comprising trade and other receivables and cash and cash deposits.
The Groups principal credit risk is attributable primarily to its trade receivables of 10.5 million 2016: 12.5 million which consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to both the current and net assets of the Group and the Company.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the portfolio to either geographical business segment or company as the Group has a well spread diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 3.8% 2016: 1.7% of the gross rent roll.
Other receivables consist principally of tax and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
Cash deposits are held at banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which monitors the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements on a regular basis.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities.
As at 31 December 2017 the net debt to property value was 27.6% 2016: 40.9% and the Group had 804.5million 2016: 656.3 million of investment and trading properties that were not secured against the Groups borrowings.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative and derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest dates on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the interest and foreign currency rates as at the reporting date.
