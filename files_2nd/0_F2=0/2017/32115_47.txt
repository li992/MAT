ii The Group and its joint venture, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited, have, in the normal course of business, entered into a number of long-term supply contracts.
The most significant of these relate to track, station and depot access facilities, together with train lease and maintenance arrangements.
iii Under UK Rail franchise agreements, the Group and its joint venture, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited, have agreed with the Department for Transport annual amounts receivable or payable in respect of the operation of rail franchises for future periods.
Under these agreements, there is a requirement to comply with a number of obligations.
Failure to comply with these obligations would be a breach of the relevant franchise.
The Group has recorded a provision for an onerous contract in respect of its Virgin Trains East Coast franchise.
The Group assessed whether a provision for onerous contracts is required in respect of its other rail franchises.
The Group has determined that no provision is necessary.
The estimation of future financial performance and the discount rate involves a significant degree of judgement.
Actual results can differ from those assumed and there can be no absolute assurance that the assumptions used will hold true.
Under certain circumstances following a breach by the Group of one or more of its rail franchise agreements, the Department for Transport has the right to terminate the relevant franchises.
Where the Group has defaulted on one franchise, the Department for Transport has cross-default rights in certain circumstances that might enable it but not require it to terminate another of the franchises.
The financial effect on the Group of a termination of one or more franchises would depend on which, if any, of the Groups contingent liabilities that the Department for Transport sought to call.
As at 29 April 2017, the capital at risk of the Group in this respect was: Virgin Trains South West East Midlands East Coast Trains Trains Total m m m m Actual liabilities Net intra-group amounts payable to train operators 68.2 68.2 Contingent liabilities Season ticket bonds 4.8 60.2 7.1 72.1 Performance bonds 20.0 40.3 15.0 75.3 Parent company guarantees to suppliers 6.6 3.0 9.6 Undrawn committed loan facilities 107.5 20.0 31.8 159.3 Capital at risk as at 29 April 2017 138.9 188.7 56.9 384.5 Cash Cash in train operating companies 60.7 68.5 90.2 219.4 Pro forma impact on net debt 199.6 257.2 147.1 603.9 To the extent that any of the above contingent liabilities in respect of Virgin Trains East Coast crystallise the Group is contractually entitled to recover 10% of any such payment from Virgin Holdings Limited.
The Group has credit exposure to Virgin Holdings Limited in this regard.
Other than in respect of the undrawn committed loan facility for Virgin Trains East Coast, we consider the likelihood of the contingent liabilities crystallising as being low.
However, if all of the contingent liabilities had crystallised and the franchises terminated at 29 April 2017, the Group would have needed to have financed 384.5m 2016: 419.3m and, subject to any amounts it recovered from Virgin Holdings Limited, its gross debt would have increased by this amount.
In addition, some of the cash in the train operating companies would be transferred with the franchises.
There is no recourse to the Group in respect of any liabilities or contingent liabilities of Virgin Rail Group.
Under the terms of the franchise agreements, other than with the UK Department for Transports consent, train operating companies can only distribute cash out of retained earnings and only to the extent they do not breach the financial covenants specified in applicable contracts.
