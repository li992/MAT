FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are determined at Group level.
The Groups Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial Officer is responsible for policy on a day-to-day basis.
The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer review the Groups risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis.
The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business.
Going concern The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 43 of the Annual Report and Accounts sets out the Groups strategy and the factors that are likely to affect the future performance and position of the business.
The financial review on pages 32 to 36 within the Strategic Report reviews the trading performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group made a significant investment in growth and the Groups net debt position increased by 145.1m to a net debt position of 296.4m as at 31 December 2017.
The investment in growth is funded by a combination of cash flow generated from the Groups mature business centres and debt.
The Group has a 550.0m revolving credit facility provided by a group of relationship banks with a final maturity in 2022, with a further option to extend to 2023.
As at 31 December 2017, 131.8m was available and undrawn.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
105 Notes to the accounts continued 24.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversified customer base, requirement for customer deposits, and payments in advance on workstation contracts minimise the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision taking into account the customer deposit held is created where debts are more than three months overdue, which reflects the Groups historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, not taking into account customer deposits held, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below.
2017 2016 m m Americas 27.8 36.9 EMEA 75.0 71.0 Asia Pacific 41.6 41.8 United Kingdom 54.9 51.2 199.3 200.9 All of the Groups trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and associated services and no individual customer has a material balance owing as a trade receivable.
The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m Not overdue 132.4 128.5 Past due 0 30 days 43.3 43.9 0.1 Past due 31 60 days 13.8 12.0 More than 60 days 31.6 21.8 35.6 19.0 221.1 21.8 220.0 19.1 At 31 December 2017, the Group maintained a provision of 21.8m against potential bad debts 2016: 19.1m arising from trade receivables.
The Group had provided 16.2m 2016: 10.3m in the year and utilised 13.5m 2016: 4.5m.
Customer deposits of 429.8m 2016: 421.0m are held by the Group, mitigating the risk of default.
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its revenue in advance of the provision of office services and requires deposits from its customers.
Cash investments and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any of these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by closely monitoring the global cash position, the available and undrawn credit facilities, and forecast capital expenditure and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group has free cash and liquid investments excluding blocked cash of 45.7m 2016: 38.8m.
In addition to cash and liquid investments, the Group had 131.8m available and undrawn under its committed borrowings.
The Directors consider the Group has adequate liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements.
The Group maintains a revolving credit facility provided by a group of international banks.
During the year, the maturity was extended until 2022, with a further option to extend to 2023.
The debt provided under the bank facility is floating rate, however, as part of the Groups balance sheet management and to protect against a future increase in interest rates, 70.0m and $30.0m were swapped into a fixed rate liability for a three-year period with an average fixed rate of respectively 0.7% and 1.8% excluding funding margin.
Although the Group has net current liabilities of 560.3m 2016: 581.1m, the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk.
A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income which will be recognised in future periods through the income statement.
The Group holds customer deposits of 429.8m 2016: 421.0m which are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material.
Therefore, the Group does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk.
The net current liabilities, excluding deferred income, were 275.0m at 31 December 2017 2016: 304.7m.
106, : 3 & $118$ 5 3257 $1' $&&28176 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of our investments in financial assets.
These exposures are actively managed by the Group treasury department in accordance with a written policy approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group does not use financial derivatives for trading or speculative reasons.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the relative proportions of fixed rate debt and floating rate debt.
Any surplus cash balances are invested short-term, and at the end of 2017 no cash was invested for a period exceeding three months.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements.
The majority of day-to-day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency and the underlying foreign exchange exposure is small.
Transactional exposures do arise in some countries where it is local market practice for a proportion of the payables or receivables to be in other than the functional currency of the affiliate.
Intercompany charging, funding and cash management activity may also lead to foreign exchange exposures.
It is the policy of the Group to seek to minimise such transactional exposures through careful management of non-local currency assets and liabilities, thereby minimising the potential volatility in the income statement.
Net investments in IWG affiliates with a functional currency other than sterling are of a long-term nature and the Group does not normally hedge such foreign currency translation exposures.
From time to time the Group uses short-term derivative financial instruments to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposures where these exposures cannot be eliminated through balancing the underlying risks.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The foreign currency exposure arising from open third party transactions held in a currency other than the functional currency of the related entity is summarised as follows: 2017 m GBP JPY EUR USD Trade and other receivables 0.1 0.6 16.7 Trade and other payables 6.7 8.7 10.4 Net statement of financial position exposure 6.6 8.1 6.3 2016 m GBP JPY EUR USD Trade and other receivables 15.1 19.1 Trade and other payables 0.5 0.1 26.5 18.7 Net statement of financial position exposure 0.5 0.1 11.4 0.4 Other market risks The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices in the income statement.
Sensitivity analysis For the year ended 31 December 2017, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 2.6m 2016: decrease of 1.9m with a corresponding decrease in total equity.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 8.6m for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: decrease of 8.8m.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.7m for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: decrease of 2.7m.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 11.1m for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: 11.3m.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 1.1m for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: decrease of 0.4m.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED During the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017, there were no transfers between levels for fair value measured instruments, and no financial instruments requiring level 3 fair value measurements were held.
Valuation techniques When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring level 2 fair values and methods used for financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value: Type Valuation technique Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other For cash and cash equivalents, receivables payables with a remaining life of less receivables payables and customer deposits than one year and customer deposits, the book value approximates the fair value because of their short-term nature.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps The fair values are based on a combination of broker quotes, forward pricing and swap models.
There was no significant unobservable input used in our valuation techniques.

As at 31 December, 131.8m was available and undrawn under this facility.
The debt provided under the credit facility is floating rate, however, as part of the Groups balance sheet management and to protect against a future increase in interest rates, 70.0m and $30.0m were swapped into a fixed rate liability for a three-year period with an average fixed rate of respectively 0.7% and 1.8% excluding funding margin.
The 550.0m revolving credit facility is subject to financial covenants relating to net debt to EBITDA, and EBITDA plus rent to interest plus rent.
The Group is in compliance with all covenant requirements.
