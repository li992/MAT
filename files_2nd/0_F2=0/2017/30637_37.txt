Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 This section describes Barclays significant policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes as a whole.
If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a particular note, the accounting policy and or critical accounting estimate is contained with the relevant note.
Reporting entity These financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries the Barclays PLC Group or the Group under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services.
In addition, individual financial statements have been presented for the holding company.
Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs issued by the Interpretations Committee, as published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
They are also in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and individual financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
These policies have been consistently applied.
Basis of preparation The consolidated and individual financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of investment property, and particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.
They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling m, the functional currency of Barclays PLC.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with The Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS.
Accounting policies Barclays prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Groups significant accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing them, are set out under the relevant notes.
Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.
i Consolidation Barclays applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which Barclays PLC has control.
The Group has control over another entity when the Group has all of the following: 1 power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights: 2 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and 3 the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of control is based on the consideration of all facts and circumstances.
The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
As the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption under Regulation 7 of the Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual partnership financial statements.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 36, and a complete list of all subsidiaries is presented in Note 45. ii Foreign currency translation The Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates.
Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement.
The Groups foreign operations including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches based mainly outside the UK may have different functional currencies.
The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.
Prior to consolidation or equity accounting the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the closing rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity.
These are transferred to the income statement when the Group disposes of the entire interest in a foreign operation, when partial disposal results in the loss of control of an interest in a subsidiary, when an investment previously accounted for using the equity method is accounted for as a financial asset, or on the disposal of an autonomous foreign operation within a branch.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 241 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 1 Significant accounting policies continued iii Financial assets and liabilities The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to the recognition, classification and measurement, and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, the impairment of financial assets, and hedge accounting.
Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract.
Trade date or settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.
Classification and measurement Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and may be held at fair value or amortised cost depending on the Groups intention toward the assets and the nature of the assets and liabilities, mainly determined by their contractual terms.
The accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item.
The Groups policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 18.
Derecognition The Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.
Financial liabilities are fide-recognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished.
An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms generally a difference of 10% in the present value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Transactions in which the Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred.
It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis.
Such an analysis compares the Groups exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer.
A cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement.
In particular, it is necessary to estimate the assets expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation.
The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible.
The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios.
Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario.
Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.
iv Issued debt and equity instruments The Group applies IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, to determine whether funding is either a financial liability debt or equity.
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having an obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument.
If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs.
Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the AGM and treated as a deduction from equity.
Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.
The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.
New and amended standards and interpretations The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, with the exception of the accounting treatment of own credit on financial liabilities designated at fair value though profit or loss under the fair value option.
Barclays has elected to early adopt the presentation of Barclays own credit gains and losses in other comprehensive income as allowed by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, from 1 January 2017.
This will have no effect on net assets, and any changes due to own credit in prior periods have not been restated.
The cumulative own credit amount has been reclassified from retained earnings to a separate reserve.
Any realised and unrealised amounts recognised in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to the income statement in future periods: refer to Note 32 for further details.
There were no other material or amended standards or interpretations that resulted in a change in accounting policy.
Future accounting developments There have been and are expected to be a number of significant changes to the Groups financial reporting after 2017 as a result of amended or new accounting standards that have been or will be issued by the IASB.
The most significant of these are as follows: IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and was endorsed by the EU in November 2016.
IFRS 9, in particular the impairment requirements, will lead to significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments.
242 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 1 Significant accounting policies continued i Impairment IFRS 9 introduces a revised impairment model which will require entities to recognise expected credit losses based on unbiased forwardlooking information.
This replaces the existing IAS 39 incurred loss model which only recognises impairment if there is objective evidence that a loss has already been incurred and would measure the loss at the most probable outcome.
The IFRS 9 impairment model will be applicable to all financial assets at amortised cost, lease receivables, debt financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
This contrasts to the IAS 39 impairment model which is not applicable to loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, which were covered by IAS 37.
In addition, IAS 39 required the impairment of available for sale debt to be based on the fair value loss rather than estimated future cash flows as for amortised cost assets.
Intercompany exposures, including loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, are also in scope under IFRS 9 in the standalone reporting entity accounts.
The measurement of expected credit loss will involve increased complexity and judgement including estimation of probabilities of default, loss given default, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives and estimation of exposures at default and assessing significant increases in credit risk.
It is expected to have a material financial impact and impairment charges will tend to be more volatile.
Impairment will also be recognised earlier and the amounts will be higher.
Unsecured products with longer expected lives, such as revolving credit cards, are expected to be most impacted.
The expected increase in the accounting impairment provision reduces CET1 capital, but the impact is partially mitigated by releasing the excess of expected loss over impairment deduction from CET1 capital.
In addition, the European Union will be adopting transitional arrangements to mitigate or spread the capital impacts of IFRS 9 adoption over a 5-year period from 1 January 2018 which Barclays will apply.
Separately, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is considering the need for permanent changes to the regulatory capital framework in order to take account of expected credit loss provisioning.
Key concepts and management judgements The impairment requirements are complex and require management judgements, estimates and assumptions.
Key concepts and management judgements include: Determining a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition IFRS 9 requires the recognition of 12 month expected credit losses the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected within 12 months of the reporting date if credit risk has not significantly increased since initial recognition stage 1, and lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments for which the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition stage 2 or which are credit impaired stage 3.
Barclays will assess when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on quantitative and qualitative assessments.
Exposures are considered to have resulted in a significant increase in credit risk and are moved to stage 2 when: Quantitative Test The annualised cumulative weighted average lifetime probability of default PD has increased by more than the agreed threshold relative to the equivalent at origination.
The relative thresholds are defined as percentage increases and set at an origination score band and segment level.
Qualitative Test Accounts that meet the portfolios high risk criteria and are subject to closer credit monitoring.
Backstop Criteria Accounts that are 30 calendar days or more past due.
The 30 days past due criteria is a backstop rather than a primary driver of moving exposures into stage 2.
Exposures will move back to stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk and when any cure criteria used for credit risk management are met.
This is subject to all payments being up to date and the customer evidencing ability and willingness to maintain future payments.
Barclays will not rely on the low credit risk exemption which would assume facilities of investment grade are not significantly deteriorated.
Determining the probability of default at initial recognition is expected to require management estimates, in particular for exposures issued before the effective date of IFRS 9.
For certain revolving facilities such as credit cards and overdrafts, this is expected to be when the facility was first entered into which could be a long time in the past.
Management overlays and other exceptions to model outputs are applied only if consistent with the objective of identifying significant increases in credit risk.
Forward-looking information Credit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Expected credit losses are the unbiased probability-weighted credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and considering future economic conditions.
When there is a non-linear relationship between forward looking economic scenarios and their associated credit losses, a range of forward looking economic scenarios, currently expected to be a minimum of five, will be considered to ensure a sufficient unbiased representative sample of the complete distribution is included in determining the expected loss.
Stress testing methodologies will be leveraged within forecasting economic scenarios for IFRS 9 purposes.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 243 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 1 Significant accounting policies continued Definition of default, credit impaired assets, write-offs, and interest income recognition The definition of default for the purpose of determining expected credit losses has been aligned to the Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default, which considers indicators that the debtor is unlikely to pay, includes exposures in forbearance and is no later than when the exposure is more than 90 days past due or 180 days past due in the case of UK mortgages.
When exposures are identified as credit impaired or purchased or originated as such, IFRS 9 requires separate disclosure and interest income is required to be calculated on the carrying value net of the impairment allowance.
Credit impaired is expected to be when the exposure has defaulted which is also anticipated to align to when an exposure is identified as individually impaired under the incurred loss model of IAS 39.
Write-off polices are not expected to change from IAS 39.
Expected life Lifetime expected credit losses must be measured over the expected life.
This is restricted to the maximum contractual life and takes into account expected prepayment, extension, call and similar options.
The exceptions are certain revolver financial instruments, such as credit cards and bank overdrafts, that include both a drawn and an undrawn component where the entitys contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entitys exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period.
The expected life for these revolver facilities is expected to be behavioural life.
Where data is insufficient or analysis inconclusive, an additional maturity factor may be incorporated to reflect the full estimated life of the exposures, based upon experienced judgement and or peer analysis.
Potential future modifications of contracts are not taken into account when determining the expected life or exposure at default until they occur.
Discounting Expected credit losses are discounted at the effective interest rate EIR at initial recognition or an approximation thereof and consistent with income recognition.
For loan commitments the EIR is that rate that is expected to apply when the loan is drawn down and a financial asset is recognised.
Issued financial guarantee contracts are discounted at the risk free rate.
Lease receivables are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease as prescribed in IAS 17.
For variable floating rate financial assets, the spot rate at the reporting date is used and projections of changes in the variable rate over the expected life are not made to estimate future interest cash flows or for discounting.
Modelling techniques Expected credit losses ECL are calculated by multiplying three main components, being the probability of default PD, loss given default LGD and the exposure at default EAD, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The regulatory Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors BCBS ECL calculations are leveraged for IFRS 9 modelling but adjusted for key differences which include: BCBS requires 12 month through the economic cycle losses whereas IFRS 9 requires 12 months or lifetime point in time losses based on conditions at the reporting date and multiple forecasts of the future economic conditions over the expected lives: and IFRS 9 models do not include certain conservative BCBS model floors and downturn assessments and require discounting to the reporting date at the original effective interest rate rather than using the cost of capital to the date of default.
Management adjustments will be made to modelled output to account for situations where known or expected risk factors and information have not been considered in the modelling process, for example forecast economic scenarios for uncertain political events.
ECL is measured at the individual financial instrument level, however a collective approach where financial instruments with similar risk characteristics are grouped together, with apportionment to individual financial instruments, is used where effects can only be seen at a collective level, for example for forward looking information.
For the IFRS 9 impairment assessment, Barclays Risk Models are used to determine the probability of default PD, loss given default LGD and exposure at default EAD.
For stage 2 and 3, Barclays applies lifetime PDs but uses 12 month PDs for stage 1.
The ECL drivers of PD, EAD and LGD are modelled at an account level which considers vintage, among other credit factors.
Also, the assessment of significant increase in credit risk is based on the initial lifetime PD curve, which accounts for the different credit risk underwritten over time.
ii Forbearance Both performing and non-performing forbearance assets are classified as stage 3 except where it is established that the concession granted has not resulted in diminished financial obligation and that no other regulatory definitions of default criteria has been triggered, in which case the asset is classified as stage 2.
The minimum probationary period for non-performing forbearance is 12 months and for performing forbearance, 24 months.
Hence, a minimum of 36 months is required for non-performing forbearance to move out of a forborne state.
iii Project governance and credit risk management Barclays has a jointly accountable Risk and Finance implementation and governance programme with representation from all impacted departments.
The current impairment Committee structures were initiated and tested from H1 2017, providing oversight for both IAS 39 and IFRS 9 impairment results.
The impairment reporting process commences with the production of economic scenarios.
The Senior Scenario Review Committee SSRC reviews and approves the scenario narratives, the core set of macroeconomic variables, probability weightings, and any scenario specific management overlays which are used in all ECL models.
The SSRC attests that the scenarios adequately account for the non-linearity and asymmetry of the loss distribution.
The Group Impairment Committee, formed of members from both Finance and Risk and attended by both the Group Finance Director and the CRO, is responsible for overseeing impairment policy and practice across Barclays Group and will approve impairment results.
Reported results and key messages are communicated to the Board Audit Committee, which has an oversight role and provides challenge of key assumptions, including the basis of the scenarios adopted.
244 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 1 Significant accounting policies continued iv Classification and measurement IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified on the basis of two criteria: 1 the business model within which financial assets are managed, and 2 their contractual cash flow characteristics whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
Financial assets will be measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
Financial assets will be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
Business models are determined on initial application and this may differ from the model before 1 January 2018 for certain portfolios.
Barclays assesses the business model at a portfolio level.
Information that is considered in determining the business model includes i policies and objectives for the relevant portfolio, ii how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management, and iii the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the reasons for such sales.
Financial assets managed on a fair value basis and those that are held for trading are held at fair value through profit and loss.
In assessing whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for solely payments of principal and interest are considered, including: i contingent and leverage features, ii non-recourse arrangements and iii features that could modify the time value of money.
Other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit and loss.
There is an option to make an irrevocable election for non traded equity investments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, in which case dividends are recognised in profit or loss, but gains or losses are not reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition, and impairment is not recognised in the income statement.
On 12 October 2017, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 9, relating to prepayment features with negative compensation: this amendment is effective from 1 January 2019 with early application permitted, however has yet to be endorsed by the EU.
This amendment allows financial assets with such features to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income provided the SPPI solely payments of principal and interest criteria in IFRS 9 are otherwise met.
In addition the amendment to IFRS 9 clarifies that a financial asset passes the SPPI criterion regardless of the event or circumstance that cause the early termination of the contract, and irrespective of which party pays or receives reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract.
Such prepayment features are present in some fixed rate corporate and investment bank loans, and are considered to meet the criteria for amortised cost under IFRS 9.
Prepayment features are consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criteria if the prepayment feature substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest and reasonable compensation for early termination of the contract.
While there are some classification changes these are not significant from a Group perspective.
v Hedge accounting IFRS 9 contains revised requirements on hedge accounting, adoption of which is optional.
In addition certain aspects of IAS 39, being the portfolio fair value hedge for interest rate risk, continues to be available for entities while applying IFRS 9 to the remainder of the entitys hedge accounting relationships until the IASB completes its accounting for dynamic risk management project.
Based on analysis performed, Barclays will continue applying IAS 39 hedge accounting, although it will implement the amended IFRS 7 hedge accounting disclosure requirements.
vi Own credit Barclays has applied the option in IFRS 9 to recognise changes in own credit for financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss under the fair value option in other comprehensive income from 1 January 2017. vii Expected impact IFRS 9 will be applied retrospectively on adoption on 1 January 2018.
Opening shareholders equity is expected to decrease by approximately 2.2bn post-tax.
This impact assessment has been estimated under an interim control environment with models that continue to undergo validation.
The implementation of the comprehensive end state control environment will continue as Barclays introduces business as usual controls throughout 2018.
Barclays will not restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers In 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which will replace IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
It applies to all contracts with customers except leases, financial instruments and insurance contracts.
The standard establishes a more systematic approach for revenue measurement and recognition by introducing a five-step model governing revenue recognition.
The five-step model includes 1 identifying the contract with the customer, 2 identifying each of the performance obligations included in the contract, 3 determining the amount of consideration in the contract, 4 allocating the consideration to each of the identified performance obligations and 5 recognising revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
In April 2016, the IASB issued clarifying amendments to IFRS 15 which provide additional application guidance but did not change the underlying principles of the standard.
The standard was endorsed by the EU in September 2016.
Barclays will implement this standard on 1 January 2018.
Barclays has elected the cumulative effect transition method with a transition adjustment calculated as of 1 January 2018 and recognised in retained earnings without restating comparative periods.
There are no significant impacts from the adoption of IFRS 15 in relation to the timing of when Barclays recognises revenues or when revenue should be recognised gross as a principal or net as an agent.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 245 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 1 Significant accounting policies continued IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, which will replace IAS 17 Leases.
IFRS 16 will apply to all leases with the exception of licenses of intellectual property, rights held by licensing agreement within the scope of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, service concession arrangements, leases of biological assets within the scope of IAS 41 Agriculture, and leases of minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources.
IFRS 16 will not result in a significant change to lessor accounting: however for lessee accounting there will no longer be a distinction between operating and finance leases.
Instead lessees will be required to recognise both a right of use asset and lease liability on-balance sheet for all leases.
As a result Barclays will observe an increase in both assets and liabilities for transactions currently accounted for as operating leases as at 1 January 2019 the effective date of IFRS 16.
A scope exemption will apply to short term and low value leases.
Current project implementation efforts are focused on preparing and sourcing information.
The standard was endorsed by the EU in November 2017.
Barclays will implement this standard on 1 January 2019.
Barclays is currently assessing the expected impact of adopting this standard.
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure.
Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005.
IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts i. e. life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance, regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features.
A few scope exceptions will apply.
The standard is effective from 1 January 2021 and has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 2 The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction: the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations: and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash settled to equity settled.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Adoption of the amendments will not have a significant impact on Barclays.
IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of IAS 12 to accounting for income tax treatments that have yet to be accepted by tax authorities, in scenarios where it may be unclear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance, or whether a taxation authority will accept an entitys tax treatment.
The effective date is 1 January 2019.
Barclays is currently assessing the impact of IFRIC 23.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies.
The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in: Credit impairment charges on page 250: Taxes on page 253: Fair value of financial instruments on page 262: Pensions and post retirement benefits obligations on page 301: and Provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters on page 283.
Other disclosures To improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, certain disclosures required under IFRS have been included within the Risk review section as follows: Credit risk on page 127 and the tables on pages 138 to 158: Market risk on page 129 and the tables on pages 159 to 163: Treasury and capital risk capital on page 130 and the tables on pages 179 to 187: and Treasury and capital risk liquidity on page 130 and the tables on pages 166 to 178.
These disclosures are covered by the Audit opinion included on pages 228 to 233 where referenced as audited.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 3 Net interest income Accounting for interest income and expenses The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Interest income on loans and advances at amortised cost, financial investments debt securities, and interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost, are calculated using the effective interest method which allocates interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
The effective interest method requires the Group to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of customers behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
Barclays incurs certain costs to originate credit card balances with the most significant being co-brand partner fees.
To the extent these costs are attributed to revolving customer balances they are capitalised and subsequently included within the calculation of the effective interest rate.
They are amortised to interest income over the period of expected repayment of the originated balance.
Costs attributed to transacting customer balances are recorded within fee and commission expense when incurred.
There are no other individual estimates involved in the calculation of effective interest rates that are material to the results or financial position.

Income arises from both the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins which are achieved through market-making and customer business and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other market variables.
Own credit gains losses As a result of the early adoption of the own credit provisions of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2017, own credit on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss which was previously recorded in the income statement is now recognised within other comprehensive income.

An impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of events that have occurred and these have adversely impacted the estimated future cash flows from the assets.
These events include: becoming aware of significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor: a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: the Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, grants a concession that it would not otherwise consider: it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation: the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties: and observable data at a portfolio level indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, although the decrease cannot yet be ascribed to individual financial assets in the portfolio such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
Impairment assessments are conducted individually for significant assets, which comprise all wholesale customer loans and larger retail business loans, and collectively for smaller loans and for portfolio level risks, such as country or sectoral risks.
For the purposes of the assessment, loans with similar credit risk characteristics are grouped together generally on the basis of their product type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past due status and other factors relevant to the evaluation of expected future cash flows.
The impairment assessment includes estimating the expected future cash flows from the asset or the group of assets, which are then discounted using the original effective interest rate calculated for the asset.
If this is lower than the carrying value of the asset or the portfolio, an impairment allowance is raised.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income continues to be recognised at the original effective interest rate on the restated carrying amount, representing the unwind of the discount of the expected cash flows, including the principal due on non-accrual loans.
Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Groups internal processes when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 7 Credit impairment charges and other provisions continued Available for sale AFS financial assets Impairment of available for sale debt instruments Debt instruments are assessed for impairment in the same way as loans.
If impairment is deemed to have occurred, the cumulative decline in the fair value of the instrument that has previously been recognised in the AFS reserve is removed from reserves and recognised in the income statement.
This may be reversed if there is evidence that the circumstances of the issuer have improved.
Impairment of available for sale equity instruments Where there has been a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of an equity instrument below its acquisition cost, it is deemed to be impaired.
The cumulative net loss that has been previously recognised directly in the AFS reserve is removed from reserves and recognised in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Further declines in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised in the income statement.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The calculation of impairment involves the use of judgement based on the Groups experience of managing credit risk.
Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio basis, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
These statistical analyses employ as primary inputs, the extent to which accounts in the portfolio are in arrears, and historical information on the eventual losses encountered from such delinquent portfolios.
There are many such models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category.
Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
The impairment allowance reflected in the financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable.
The impairment charge reflected in the income statement for retail portfolios is 2,095m 2016: 2,053m: 2015: 1,535m and amounts to 90% 2016: 87%: 2015: 88% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
For individually significant assets, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are taken into account for example, the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Groups position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process.
The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate, and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculation of future cash flows.
Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken.
Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.
The impairment charge reflected in the financial statements in relation to wholesale portfolios is 238m 2016: 299m: 2015: 209m and amounts to 10% 2016: 13%: 2015: 12% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
Further information on impairment allowances and related credit information is set out within the Risk review on page 156.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 251 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 8 Operating expenses Accounting for staff costs The Group applies IAS 19 Employee benefits in its accounting for most of the components of staff costs.
Short-term employee benefits salaries, accrued performance costs and social security are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate.
Performance costs recognised to the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its employees that can be measured reliably and are recognised over the period of service that employees are required to work to qualify for the payments.
Deferred cash and share awards are made to employees to incentivise performance over the period employees provide services.
To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period.
The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share awards is recognised is based upon the period employees consider their services contribute to the awards.
For past awards, the Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest.
In relation to awards granted from 2017, the Group, taking into account the changing employee understanding surrounding those awards, considered it appropriate for expense to be recognised over the vesting period including the financial year prior to the grant date.
The accounting policies for share-based payments, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits are included in Note 34 and Note 35 respectively.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 10 Tax Accounting for income taxes Barclays applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income.
Income tax payable on taxable profits Current tax is recognised as an expense in the periods in which the profits arise.
Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes.
Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offset against taxable profits arising in the current or prior periods.
Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except in certain circumstances where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
The Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist when it considers that ultimately, in the future, the amount of profit subject to tax may be greater than the amount initially reflected in the Groups tax returns.
The Group accounts for provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions in two different ways.
A current tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will alter the amount of cash tax due to, or from, a tax authority in the future.
From recognition, the current tax provision is then measured at the amount the Group ultimately expects to pay the tax authority to resolve the position.
Deferred tax provisions are adjustments made to the carrying value of deferred tax assets in respect of uncertain tax positions.
A deferred tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will result in a reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset.
From recognition of a provision, measurement of the underlying deferred tax asset is adjusted to take into account the expected impact of resolving the uncertain tax position on the loss or temporary difference giving rise to the deferred tax asset.
The approach taken to measurement takes account of whether the uncertain tax position is a discrete position that will be reviewed by the tax authority in isolation from any other position, or one of a number of issues which are expected to be reviewed together concurrently and resolved simultaneously with a tax authority.
Barclays measurement of provisions is based upon its best estimate of the additional profit that will become subject to tax.
For a discrete position, consideration is given only to the merits of that position.
Where a number of issues are expected to be reviewed and resolved together, Barclays will take into account not only the merits of its position in respect of each particular issue but also the overall level of provision relative to the aggregate of the uncertain tax positions across all the issues that are expected to be resolved at the same time.
In addition, in assessing provision levels, it is assumed that tax authorities will review uncertain tax positions and that all facts will be fully and transparently disclosed.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements There are two key areas of judgement that impact the reported tax position.
Firstly, the level of provisioning for uncertain tax positions: and secondly, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets.
The Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of current and deferred tax balances, including provisions for uncertain tax positions in the next financial year.
The provisions for uncertain tax positions cover a diverse range of issues and reflect advice from external counsel where relevant.
It should be noted that only a proportion of the total uncertain tax positions will be under audit at any point in time, and could therefore be subject to challenge by a tax authority over the next year.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts.
Detail on the recognition of deferred tax assets is provided in this note.

As the rate reduction was enacted before the balance sheet date, this has resulted in a one-off tax charge as a result of the re-measurement of the Groups US deferred tax assets in the 2017 period.
This downward re-measurement of the Groups US deferred tax assets as a result of the rate reduction is partially offset by the increase in the value of the US branch deferred tax assets as a result of Barclays Bank PLC making a tax election in the period to exclude the future profits and losses of its overseas branches from UK taxation.
In addition the effective tax rate is also affected by profits earned outside the UK being taxed at local statutory tax rates that are higher than the UK tax rate, provisions for UK customer redress, investigations and litigation being non-deductible for tax purposes, non-creditable taxes and non-deductible expenses including UK bank levy.
These factors, which have each increased the effective tax rate, are partially offset by the impact of non-taxable gains and income in the period.
The Groups future tax charge will be sensitive to the geographic mix of profits earned and the tax rates in force in the jurisdictions that we operate in.
In the UK, legislation to reduce the corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 has been enacted.
The reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 1 January 2018 is expected to have a positive impact on the returns generated by the Groups US business.
The ultimate impact however, is subject to any effect of the Base Erosion Anti-abuse Tax BEAT, which was introduced by US Tax Reform and presented as an anti-avoidance provision, but is capable of having broad application to companies making payments to foreign affiliates.
The provisions introducing the BEAT are complex and there are currently uncertainties surrounding their practical and technical application.
The Group is currently considering any future impact of the BEAT which may reduce the benefit of the reduction in the US federal corporate income tax rate.

The deferred tax assets of the Groups US business have been re-measured due to the reduction in the US federal corporate income tax rate enacted in the year.
No account has been taken of the impact of any potential future BEAT liabilities in measuring the US deferred tax assets and liabilities and any future BEAT liabilities would be accounted for in the period they arise.
Under US tax rules, losses occurring prior to 1 January 2018 can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 20 years.
The losses first arose in 2011 in the IHC Tax Group and 2008 in the US Branch Tax Group and therefore any unused amounts may begin to expire in 2031 and 2028 respectively.
The remaining US deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences for which there is no time limit on recovery.
The deferred tax assets for the IHC and the US Branch Tax Groups tax losses are currently projected to be fully utilised by 2019.
In prior periods the US Branch deferred tax assets have been measured as the difference between the UK and US tax rates to take into account UK taxation expected to arise on the profits of the US Branch.
During the period, Barclays Bank PLC made a UK tax election that causes the future profits or losses of the Companys overseas branches to be excluded from the charge to UK tax and therefore subject to tax only in the applicable overseas jurisdiction.
The deferred tax assets held by the US Branch of Barclays Bank PLC have been re-measured to the US tax rate as a result of this election.
UK tax group deferred tax asset The deferred tax asset in the UK tax group of 492m 2016: 575m relates entirely to temporary differences.
Other deferred tax assets The deferred tax asset of 318m 2016: 321m in other entities within the Group includes 27m 2016: 40m relating to tax losses carried forward.
These deferred tax assets relate to a number of different territories and their recognition is based on profit forecasts or local country law which indicate that it is probable that the losses and temporary differences will be utilised.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 255 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 10 Tax continued Of the deferred tax asset of 318m 2016: 321m, an amount of 218m 2016: 267m relates to entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or prior year.
This has been taken into account in reaching the above conclusion that these deferred tax assets will be fully recovered in the future.
The table below shows movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.
The amounts are different from those disclosed on the balance sheet and in the preceding table as they are presented before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 522m 2016: 273m.
The amount of deferred tax assets expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is 3,399m 2016: 5,066m.
These amounts are before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
Unrecognised deferred tax Tax losses and temporary differences Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of 157m 2016: 64m and gross tax losses of 17,919m 2016: 16,820m.
The tax losses include capital losses of 3,126m 2016: 3,138m and unused tax credits of 546m 2016: 514m.
Of these tax losses, 409m 2016: 394m expire within five years, 193m 2016: 57m expire within six to ten years, 2,016m 2016: 358m expire within 11 to 20 years and 15,301m 2016: 16,011m can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which they can be utilised.
Group investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the value of Groups investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of these temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised decreased in the period to 0.1bn 2016: 2bn following the reduction of the Groups holding in BAGL during 2017.

When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 288m 2016: 184m shares.
The increase in the number of potential ordinary shares is mainly due to the widening of the spread between the average share price of 2.08 2016: 1.74 and the average weighted strike price of 1.41 2016: 1.88 compared to the prior year.
The total number of share options outstanding, under schemes considered to be potentially dilutive, was 534m 2016: 584m.
These options have strike prices ranging from 1.20 to 2.28.
Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2017, 10m 2016: 93m were anti-dilutive.
The 136m 2016: 173m increase in the basic weighted average number of shares since 31 December 2016 to 16,996m is primarily due to shares issued under employee share schemes and the Scrip Dividend Programme.
12 Dividends on ordinary shares The Directors have approved a final dividend in respect of 2017 of 2.0p per ordinary share of 25p each which will be paid on 05 April 2018 to shareholders on the Share Register on 02 March 2018 resulting in a total dividend of 3.0p per share for the year.
On 31 December 2017, there were 17,060m ordinary shares in issue.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 does not reflect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 2018.

Dividends are funded out of distributable reserves, for further detail, see page 88 unaudited.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 257 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value The notes included in this section focus on assets and liabilities the Group holds and recognises at fair value.
Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an arms-length transaction with a willing counterparty, which may be an observable market price or, where there is no quoted price for the instrument, may be an estimate based on available market data.
Detail regarding the Groups approach to managing market risk can be found on page on 129.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 15 Derivative financial instruments Accounting for derivatives Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the contract.
They include swaps, forward rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Groups net interest income, net trading income and derivative assets and liabilities.
Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet.
All derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives that are in a designated cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationship.
Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
This includes terms included in a contract or other financial asset or liability the host, which, had it been a standalone contract, would have had met the definition of a derivative.
If these are separated from the host i. e. when the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related with those of the host contract and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value though profit or loss, then they are accounted for in the same way as derivatives.
Hedge accounting The Group applies hedge accounting to represent, to the maximum possible extent permitted under accounting standards, the economic effects of its interest and currency risk management strategies.
Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, and equity exposures and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.
If hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method.
If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments The Groups net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings.
Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement.
The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Groups investment in the operation.

18 Fair value of financial instruments Accounting for financial assets and liabilities fair values The Group applies IAS 39.
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of initial recognition including transaction costs, other than financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss and, depending on the classification of the asset or liability, may continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Wherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument.
For many of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available and valuation models are used to estimate fair value.
The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value.
These models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.
For financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data such as in primary issuance and redemption activity for structured notes.
On initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary.
The best evidence of an instruments fair value on initial recognition is typically the transaction price.
However, if fair value can be evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or is based on a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets, then the instrument should be recognised at the fair value derived from such observable market data.
For valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price Day One profit is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction: or over the period until all model inputs will become observable where appropriate: or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.
262 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time.
Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction bespoke or generic.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation.
Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.
The sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 270.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation models make use of unobservable inputs Level 3 assets and liabilities.
This note provides information on these instruments, including the related unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable inputs, and a sensitivity analysis.
Valuation IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to classify its assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of significant market inputs.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below.
Quoted market prices Level 1 Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Valuation technique using observable inputs Level 2 Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable either directly or indirectly.
Valuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.
Unobservable input levels are generally determined via reference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.

Valuation techniques and sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs Level 3 to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of the valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis.
The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.
The valuation techniques used for the material products within Levels 2 and 3, and observability and sensitivity analysis for products within Level 3, are described below.
Interest rate derivatives Description: Derivatives linked to interest rates or inflation indices.
The category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.
Valuation: Interest rate and inflation derivatives are generally valued using curves of forward rates constructed from market data to project and discount the expected future cash flows of trades.
Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market inputs, and use industry standard or bespoke models depending on the product type.
264 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Observability: In general, inputs are considered observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.
Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques or inferred via another reasonable method.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity to unobservable valuation inputs is based on the dispersion of consensus data services where available, or alternatively it is based on stress scenarios or historic data.
Foreign exchange derivatives Description: Derivatives linked to the foreign exchange FX market.
The category includes FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options.
The majority are traded as over the counter OTC derivatives.
Valuation: FX derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models depending on the product type.
Valuation inputs include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.
Observability: FX correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.
Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity relating to unobservable valuation inputs is primarily based on the dispersion of consensus data services.
Credit derivatives Description: Derivatives linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities or a pool of referenced assets e. g. a securitised product.
The category includes single name and index credit default swaps CDS, asset backed CDS and synthetic collateralised debt obligations CDOs.
Valuation: CDS are valued on industry standard models using curves of credit spreads as the principal input.
Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.
Synthetic CDOs are valued using a model that incorporates credit spreads, recovery rates, correlations and interest rates, and is calibrated to the index tranche market.
Observability: CDS contracts referencing entities that are actively traded are generally considered observable.
Other valuation inputs are considered observable if products with significant sensitivity to the inputs are actively traded in a liquid market.
Unobservable valuation inputs are generally determined with reference to recent transactions or inferred from observable trades of the same issuer or similar entities.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity to unobservable CDS contracts is determined by applying a shift to credit spread curves based on the average range of pricing observed in the market for similar CDS.
Sensitivity to unobservable synthetic CDOs is calculated using correlation levels derived from the range of contributors to a consensus bespoke service.
Equity derivatives Description: Exchange traded or OTC derivatives linked to equity indices and single names.
The category includes vanilla and exotic equity products.
Valuation: Equity derivatives are valued using industry standard models.
Valuation inputs include stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repurchase curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.
Observability: In general, valuation inputs are observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally estimated using the dispersion of consensus data services.
Commodity derivatives Description: Exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on underlying commodities such as metals, crude oil and refined products, agricultural, power and natural gas.
Valuation: Commodity swaps and options are valued using models incorporating discounting of cash flows and other industry standard modelling techniques.
Valuation inputs include forward curves, volatilities implied from market observable inputs and correlations.
Observability: Commodity correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.
Unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products, or by applying extrapolation techniques to observable inputs.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is determined primarily by measuring historical variability over a period of years.
Where historical data is unavailable or uncertainty is due to volumetric risk, sensitivity is measured by applying appropriate stress scenarios or using proxy bid-offer spread levels.
Complex derivative instruments Valuation estimates made by counterparties with respect to complex derivative instruments, for the purpose of determining the amount of collateral to be posted, often differ, sometimes significantly, from Barclays own estimates.
In almost all cases, Barclays has been able to successfully resolve such differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements.
Due to the ongoing nature of collateral calls, Barclays will often be engaged in discussion with one or more counterparties in respect of such differences at any given time.
Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are considered, like any other third party valuation, when determining Barclays fair value estimates.
Government and government sponsored debt Description: Government bonds, supra sovereign bonds and agency bonds.
Valuation: Liquid bonds that are actively traded through an exchange or clearing house are marked to the levels observed in these markets.
Other actively traded bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing sources.
Observability: prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable.
Unobservable bonds prices are generally determined by reference to bond yields for actively traded bonds from the same or a similar issuer.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally determined by using a range of observable alternative prices.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 265 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Corporate debt Description: Primarily corporate bonds.
Valuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing sources.
Observability: Prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable.
Unobservable bonds prices are generally determined by reference to bond yields or CDS spreads for actively traded instruments issued by or referencing the same or a similar issuer.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally determined by applying a shift to bond yields using the average ranges of external levels observed in the market for similar bonds.
Certificates of Deposit, Commercial Paper and other money market instruments Description: Certificates of deposit, commercial paper and other money market instruments.
Valuation: Instruments are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
Observability: Prices for actively traded instruments are considered observable.
Unobservable instrument prices are generally determined by reference to bond yields or CDS spreads for actively traded instruments issued by or referencing the same or a similar issuer.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally calculated by using a range of observable alternative prices.
Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements Description: Includes securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and other similar secured lending agreements.
The agreements are primarily short-term in nature.
Valuation: Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are generally valued by discounting the expected future cash flows using industry standard models that incorporate market interest rates and repurchase rates, based on the specific details of the transaction.
Observability: Inputs are deemed observable up to liquid maturities, and are determined based on the specific features of the transaction.
Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally estimated using the dispersion of consensus data services, stress scenarios or historic data.
In general, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs is not significant to the overall valuation given the predominantly short-term nature of the agreements.
Non-asset backed loans Description: Largely made up of fixed rate loans.
Valuation: Fixed rate loans are valued using models that discount expected future cash flows based on interest rates and loan spreads.
Observability: Within this loan population, the loan spread is generally unobservable.
Unobservable loan spreads are determined by incorporating funding costs, the level of comparable assets such as gilts, issuer credit quality and other factors.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity of fixed rate loans is calculated by applying a shift to loan spreads.
Asset backed securities Description: Securities that are linked to the cash flows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation.
The category includes residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, CDOs, collateralised loan obligations CLOs and other asset backed securities.
Valuation: Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices.
Otherwise, valuations are determined using industry standard discounted cash flow analysis that calculates the fair value based on valuation inputs such as constant default rate, conditional prepayment rate, loss given default and yield.
These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.
Proxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities underlying attributes including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition historical losses, borrower characteristics and loan attributes such as loan to value ratio and geographic concentration and credit ratings original and current.
Observability: Where an asset backed product does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, the instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity analysis for asset backed products is based on externally sourced pricing dispersion or by stressing the inputs of discount cash flow analysis.
Issued debt Description: Debt notes issued by Barclays.
Valuation: Issued debt is valued using discounted cash flow techniques and industry standard models incorporating various inputs observed for each instrument.
Observability: Barclays issued notes are generally observable.
Structured notes are debt instruments containing embedded derivatives.
Where either an input to the embedded derivative or the debt instrument is deemed unobservable and significant to the overall valuation of the note, the structured note is classified as Level 3.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity to the unobservable input in the embedded derivative is calculated in line with the method used for the derivative instrument concerned.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Equity cash products Description: Includes listed equities, Exchange Traded Funds ETF and preference shares.
Valuation: Valuation of equity cash products is primarily determined through market observable prices.
Observability: Prices for actively traded equity cash products are considered observable.
Unobservable equity prices are generally determined by reference to actively traded instruments that are similar in nature, or inferred via another reasonable method.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally calculated based on applying a shift to the valuation of the underlying asset.
Private equity investments Description: Includes private equity holdings and principal investments.
Valuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines which require the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed companies.
While the valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.
Observability: Inputs are considered observable if there is active trading in a liquid market of products with significant sensitivity to the inputs.
Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Level 3 sensitivity: Private equity valuation models are each sensitive to a number of key assumptions, such as projected future earnings, comparator multiples, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Valuation sensitivity is generally estimated by shifting assumptions to reasonable alternative levels.
Assets and liabilities held for sale Description: Assets and liabilities held for sale consist of disposal groups Barclays intend to sell.
Valuation: Assets and liabilities held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Level 3 sensitivity: The disposal groups that are measured at fair value less cost to sell are valued at the agreed price less costs to sell and are not expected to display significant sensitivity.
The sensitivity of the assets and liabilities measured at carrying value is explained within the relevant product descriptions.
Other Description: Other includes commercial real estate loans, funds and fund-linked products, asset backed loans, physical commodities and investment property.
Assets and liabilities reclassified between Level 1 and Level 2 During the period, there were transfers of 3,807m of government bond assets and 1,023m 950 m of commodity derivative assets and liabilities from Level 1 to Level 2 2016: 2,340m of government bond assets transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 to reflect the market observability of these product types.
These transfers are reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.
Level 3 movement analysis The following table summarises the movements in the Level 3 balances during the period.
Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.
Assets and liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale and measured at fair value less cost to sell are not included as these are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Asset and liability transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are primarily due to i an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an input or ii a change in the significance of the unobservable input, with assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 if an unobservable input is deemed significant.
During the year: 721m of net interest rate derivatives were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 to reflect the market observability of the products: 2,284m of non-asset backed loans were derecognised due to a substantial modification of terms on the ESHLA loans.
The restructured loans are measured on an amortised cost basis.

Points are a percentage of par: for example, 100 points equals 100% of par.
A basis point equals 1 100th of 1%: for example, 150 basis points equals 1.5%.
b Certain derivative instruments are classified as Level 3 due to a significant unobservable credit spread input into the calculation of the Credit Valuation Adjustment for the instruments.
The range of significant unobservable credit spreads is between 31-596 bps 2016: 65-874bps.
The following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value measurement of the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs.
Where sensitivities are described, the inverse relationship will also generally apply.
Where reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement.
A description of those interrelationships is included below.
Forwards A price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.
In general, a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the contracted receiver of the underlying currency, bond, commodity, etc.
but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
Credit spread Credit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate.
Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant demands for taking on exposure to the credit risk of an instrument and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.
In general, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in a fair value decrease for a cash asset.
For a derivative instrument, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Volatility Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in return for a given derivative underlying.
It is an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument input or index will change in value over time.
In general, volatilities are implied from observed option prices.
For unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, and the strike maturity profile of a specific contract.
In general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the holder of a simple option, but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
There may be interrelationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs e. g. when equity prices fall, implied equity volatilities generally rise but these are generally specific to individual markets and may vary over time.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 271 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Correlation Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables.
Correlation can be a significant input into valuation of derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument.
Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation between default processes for the separate names that make up the reference pool of a CDO structure.
A significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Comparable price Comparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield or spread over a liquid benchmark from the price of a comparable observable instrument, then adjusting that yield or spread to account for relevant differences such as maturity or credit quality.
Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable and unobservable instruments in order to establish a value.
In general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in an increase in the price of the unobservable instrument.
For derivatives, a change in the comparable price in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Loan spread Loan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate.
Loan spreads typically reflect credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.
The ESHLA portfolio primarily consists of long dated fixed rate loans extended to counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and Local Authority sectors.
The loans are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable loan spreads to the valuation.
Valuation uncertainty arises from the long dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads.
The majority of ESHLA loans are to borrowers in heavily regulated sectors that are considered extremely low credit risk, and have a history of zero defaults since inception.
While the overall loan spread range is from 30bps to 596bps 2016: 30bps to 1,495bps, the vast majority of spreads are concentrated towards the bottom end of this range, with 99% of the loan notional being valued with spreads less than 200bps consistently for both years.
In general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a fair value decrease for a loan.
Loss given default LGD Loss given default represents the expected loss upon liquidation of the collateral as a percentage of the balance outstanding.
In general, a significant increase in the LGD in isolation will translate to lower recovery and lower projected cash flows to pay to the securitisation, resulting in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of the securitised product.
EBITDA Multiple EBITDA multiple is the ratio of the valuation of the investment to the Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
In general a significant increase in the multiple will result in a fair value increase for an investment.
Fair value adjustments Key balance sheet valuation adjustments are quantified below: 2017 2016 m m Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads 391 475 Uncollateralised derivative funding 45 82 Derivative credit valuation adjustments 103 237 Derivative debit valuation adjustments 131 242 Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads The Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets.
For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded to reflect the exit level for the expected close out strategy.
The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk management and hedging strategy.
Bid-offer levels are generally derived from market quotes such as broker data.
Less liquid instruments may not have a directly observable bid-offer level.
In such instances, an exit price adjustment may be derived from an observable bid-offer level for a comparable liquid instrument, or determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario or historical analysis.
Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads have reduced by 84m to 391m as a result of risk reduction and spread tightening.
Discounting approaches for derivative instruments Collateralised In line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of the collateral that can be posted within the relevant credit support annex CSA.
The CSA aware discounting approach recognises the cheapest to deliver option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.
272 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Uncollateralised A fair value adjustment of 45m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivative portfolios and collateralised derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not allow the rehypothecation of collateral received.
This adjustment is referred to as the Funding Fair Value Adjustment FFVA.
FFVA has decreased by 37m to 45m mainly as a result of material trade unwinds.
FFVA is determined by calculating the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and applying a funding rate to the exposure that reflects the market cost of funding.
Barclays internal Treasury rates are used as an input to the calculation.
The approach takes into account the probability of default of each counterparty, as well as any mandatory break clauses.
FFVA incorporates a scaling factor which is an estimate of the extent to which the cost of funding is incorporated into observed traded levels.
On calibrating the scaling factor, it is with the assumption that Credit Valuation Adjustments CVA and Debit Valuation Adjustments DVA are retained as valuation components incorporated into such levels.
The effect of incorporating this scaling factor at 31 December 2017 was to reduce FFVA by 138m 2016: 246m.
The approach outlined above has been in use since 2012 with no significant changes.
Barclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to uncollateralised derivative valuation remains appropriate.
The above approach has been in use since 2012 with no significant changes.
Derivative credit and debit valuation adjustments CVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays own credit quality respectively.
These adjustments are calculated for uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives across all asset classes.
CVA and DVA are calculated using estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, at a counterparty level.
Counterparties include but are not limited to corporates, sovereigns and sovereign agencies and supranationals.
Exposure at default is generally estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors through approximating with a more vanilla structure, or by using current or scenario-based mark to market as an estimate of future exposure.
Probability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets.
Where this information is not available, or considered unreliable, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default and recovery information.
In particular, this applies to sovereign related names where the effect of using the recovery assumptions implied in CDS levels would imply a 50m 2016: 95m increase in CVA.
Correlation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors, termed wrong-way, or right-way risk, is not systematically incorporated into the CVA calculation but is adjusted where the underlying exposure is directly related to the counterparty.
CVA decreased by 134m to 103m, primarily due to reductions in the average maturity of the portfolio driven by trade unwinds.
DVA reduced by 111m to 131m, primarily as a result of Barclays credit spreads tightening and trade unwinds.
Portfolio exemptions The Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of financial assets and liabilities.
Instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position i. e. an asset for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position i. e. a liability for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions.
Accordingly, the Group measures the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs For instruments where fair value cannot be evidenced by reference to observable market data, initial recognition occurs at the transaction price.
This is achieved by recognising a reserve for the difference between unobservable fair value and transaction price.
For financial instruments measured at fair value on an ongoing basis the reserve was 109m 2016: 179m.
During 2017 there were additions of 34m 2016: 29m and amortisation and releases of 104m 2016: 37m.
Third party credit enhancements Structured and brokered certificates of deposit issued by Barclays are insured up to $250,000 per depositor by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC in the US.
The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance coverage.
The carrying value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IAS 39 fair value option includes this third party credit enhancement.
The on-balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to 4,070m 2016: 3,905m.

b Disposal groups held for sale and measured at fair value less cost to sell are included in the fair value table.
The fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate to directly compare this fair value information to independent market sources or other financial institutions.
Different valuation methodologies and assumptions can have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.
Financial assets The carrying value of financial assets held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the relevant accounting policy in Note 20.
Loans and advances to banks The fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality.
Where market data or credit information on the underlying borrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates.
There is minimal difference between the fair value and carrying amount due to the short-term nature of the lending, i. e. predominantly overnight deposit, and the high credit quality of counterparties.
Loans and advances to customers The fair value of loans and advances to customers, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality.
For retail lending, i. e. home loans and credit cards, tailored discounted cash flow models are predominantly used to estimate the fair value of different product types.
For example, for home loans different models are used to estimate fair values of tracker, offset and fixed rate mortgage products.
Key inputs to these models are the differentials between historic and current product margins and estimated prepayment rates.
The discount of fair value to carrying amount for home loans has reduced to 1.2% 2016: 2.5% due to changes in product mix across the loan portfolio and movements in product margins.
The fair value of corporate loans is calculated by the use of discounted cash flow techniques where the gross loan values are discounted at a rate of difference between contractual margins and hurdle rates or spreads where Barclays charges a margin over LIBOR depending on credit quality and loss given default and years to maturity.
The discount between the carrying and fair value has increased to 1.3% 2016: 1.0%.
274 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Reverse repurchase agreements The fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully collateralised.
Financial liabilities The carrying value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 22.
Deposits from banks and customer accounts In many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently, such as customer accounts and other deposits and short-term debt securities.
The fair value for deposits with longer-term maturities mainly time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Consequently the fair value discount is minimal.
There were transfers of 34,163m of deposits from banks and customers from Level 2 to Level 1 to reflect the market observability of these product types.
Debt securities in issue Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where the instruments are short dated, carrying amount approximates fair value.
The fair value difference has increased to 2.0% 2016: 1.4%.
Repurchase agreements The fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.
Subordinated liabilities Fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issuer concerned or issuers with similar terms and conditions.
19 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the Group reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis on the balance sheet only if there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The following table shows the impact of netting arrangements on: all financial assets and liabilities that are reported net on the balance sheet all derivative financial instruments and reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing agreements that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements, but do not qualify for balance sheet netting.
The table identifies the amounts that have been offset in the balance sheet and also those amounts that are covered by enforceable netting arrangements offsetting arrangements and financial collateral but do not qualify for netting under the requirements of IAS 32 described above.
The Net amounts presented on the next page are not intended to represent the Groups actual exposure to credit risk, as a variety of credit mitigation strategies are employed in addition to netting and collateral arrangements.

Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing of 167,029m 2016: 75,470m is split by fair value 126,691m 2016: 55,710m and amortised cost 40,338m 2016: 19,760m.
Derivative assets and liabilities The Financial instruments column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off under netting agreements, such as the ISDA Master Agreement or derivative exchange or clearing counterparty agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transactions covered by the agreements if an event of default or other predetermined events occur.
Financial collateral refers to cash and non-cash collateral obtained, typically daily or weekly, to cover the net exposure between counterparties by enabling the collateral to be realised in an event of default or if other predetermined events occur.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing The Amounts offset column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off under netting agreements, such as Global Master Repurchase Agreements and Global Master Securities Lending Agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transactions covered by the agreements if an event of default or other predetermined events occur.
Financial collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which are legally transferred and can be liquidated in the event of counterparty default.
These offsetting and collateral arrangements and other credit risk mitigation strategies used by the Group are further explained in the Credit risk mitigation section on page 128.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Financial instruments held at amortised cost The notes included in this section focus on assets that are held at amortised cost arising from the Groups retail and wholesale lending including loans and advances, finance leases, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and similar secured lending.
Detail regarding the Groups liquidity and capital position can be found on pages 166 to 187.
20 Loans and advances to banks and customers Accounting for financial instruments held at amortised cost Loans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost.
That is, the initial fair value which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability.
Balances deferred on-balance sheet as EIR adjustments are amortised to interest income over the life of the financial instrument to which they relate.
In accordance with IAS 39, where the Group no longer intends to trade in financial assets it may transfer them out of the held for trading classification and measure them at amortised cost if they meet the definition of a loan.
The initial value used for the purposes of establishing amortised cost is fair value on the date of the transfer.
2017 2016 As at 31 December m m Gross loans and advances to banks 35,663 43,251 Less: allowance for impairment Loans and advances to banks 35,663 43,251 Gross loans and advances to customers 370,204 397,404 Less: allowance for impairment 4,652 4,620 Loans and advances to customers 365,552 392,784 21 Finance leases Accounting for finance leases The Group applies IAS 17 Leases in accounting for finance leases, both where it is the lessor or the lessee.
A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee.
Where the Group is the lessor, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet: instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Where the Group is the lessee, the leased asset is recognised in property, plant and equipment and a finance lease liability is recognised, representing the minimum lease payments payable under the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Interest income or expense is recognised in interest receivable or payable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.

Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.
Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing The Group purchases a reverse repurchase agreement or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them.
The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration paid or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.
The Group may also sell a repurchase agreement or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them.
The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration received or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Non-current assets and other investments The notes included in this section focus on the Groups non-current tangible and intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, which provide long-term future economic benefits.
23 Property, plant and equipment Accounting for property, plant and equipment The Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required.
Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in the enhancement to the asset.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation: Annual rates in calculating depreciation Depreciation rate Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property more than 50 years to run 2-3.3% Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease less than 50 years to run Over the remaining life of the lease Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Computers and similar equipment 17-33% Fixtures and fittings and other equipment 9-20% Where leasehold property has a remaining useful life of less than 17 years, costs of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the remaining life of the lease.
Investment property The Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value at each balance sheet date, reflecting market conditions at the reporting date.
Gains and losses on remeasurement are included in the income statement.

The fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary for condition and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reflect current economic conditions.
Discounted cash flow techniques may be employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market inputs such as market rents and interest rates.
Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualified independent valuers.
Refer to Note 18 for further details.
24 Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting for goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill The carrying value of goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Groups share of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
The test involves comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the present value of the pre tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the cash generating unit CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGUs fair value if this is higher.
Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Intangible assets are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.
Intangible assets are stated at cost which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally using the amortisation periods set out below: Annual rates in calculating amortisation Amortisation period Goodwill Not amortised a Internally generated software 12 months to 6 years Other software 12 months to 6 years Customer lists 12 months to 25 years Licences and other 12 months to 25 years Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
Note a Exceptions to the above rate relate to useful lives of certain core banking platforms that are assessed individually and, if appropriate, amortised over longer periods ranging from 10 to 15 years.

This includes the identification of independent CGUs and the allocation of goodwill to these units based on which units are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The allocation is reviewed following business reorganisations.
Cash flow projections necessarily take into account changes in the market in which a business operates including the level of growth, competitive activity, and the impacts of regulatory change.
Determining both the expected pre-tax cash flows and the risk adjusted interest rate appropriate to the operating unit requires the exercise of judgement.
The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-term sustainable cash flows.
Other intangible assets Determining the estimated useful lives of intangible assets such as those arising from contractual relationships requires an analysis of circumstances.
The assessment of whether an asset is exhibiting indicators of impairment as well as the calculation of impairment, which requires the estimate of future cash flows and fair values less costs to sell, also requires the preparation of cash flow forecasts and fair values for assets that may not be regularly bought and sold.
Impairment testing of goodwill During 2017, the Group recognised an impairment charge of nil 2016: nil.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used for impairment testing are set out below for each significant goodwill balance.
Other goodwill of 769m 2016: 787m was allocated to multiple CGUs which are not considered individually significant.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 281 Notes to the financial statements Non-curr Non-current assets and other in ent assets and other inv vestments estments 24 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Barclays UK Goodwill relating to Woolwich in Personal Banking and Business Banking was 3,130m 2016: 3,130m of the total Barclays UK balance.
The carrying value of the CGU has been determined by using net asset value.
The recoverable amount of the CGU, calculated as value in use, has been determined using cash flow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five-year period, with a terminal growth rate of 2.0% 2016: 2.0% applied thereafter.
The forecast cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 13.9% 2016: 14.6%.
Based on these assumptions, the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 5,262m 2016: 4,130m.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by 1,128m 2016: 988m and 734m 2016: 615m respectively.
A reduction in the forecast cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 1,409m 2016: 1,293m.
The increase in headroom in 2017 reflects changes in discount rate and future cash flow projections.
25 Operating leases Accounting for operating leases The Group applies IAS 17 Leases, for operating leases.
An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor.
Where the Group is the lessor, lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
The Group holds the leased assets on-balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.
Where the Group is the lessee, rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
Operating lease receivables The Group acts as lessor, whereby items of plant and equipment are purchased and then leased to third parties under arrangements qualifying as operating leases.
The future minimum lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable operating leases was nil 2016: nil.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
With such operating lease arrangements, the asset is kept on the lessors balance sheet and the Group reports the future minimum lease payments as an expense over the lease term.
The leases have various terms, escalation and renewal rights.
There are no contingent rents payable.
Operating lease rentals of 342m 2016: 560m have been included in administration and general expenses.
The future minimum lease payments by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 2016 Property Equipment Property Equipment m m m m Not more than one year 332 2 364 Over one year but not more than five years 844 21 974 23 Over five years 1,337 1,520 Total 2,513 23 2,858 23 Total future minimum sublease payments to be received under non-cancellable subleases was 53m 2016: 2m.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings The notes included in this section focus on the Groups accruals, provisions and contingent liabilities.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.
26 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities 2017 2016 m m Accruals and deferred income 3,951 4,422 Other creditors 4,563 4,382 Obligations under finance leases refer to Note 21 20 15 Insurance contract liabilities, including unit-linked liabilities 31 52 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities 8,565 8,871 27 Provisions Critical accounting estimates and judgements The financial reporting of provisions involves a significant degree of judgement and is complex.
Identifying whether a present obligation exists and estimating the probability, timing, nature and quantum of the outflows that may arise from past events requires judgements to be made based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events and often requires specialist professional advice.
When matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements and estimates can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty involved.
Management continues to monitor matters as they develop to re-evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, however there can remain a wide range of possible outcomes and uncertainties, particularly in relation to legal, competition and regulatory matters, and as a result it is often not practicable to make meaningful estimates even when matters are at a more advanced stage.
The complexity of such matters often requires the input of specialist professional advice in making assessments to produce estimates.
Customer redress and legal, competition and regulatory matters are areas where a higher degree of professional judgement is required.
The amount that is recognised as a provision can also be very sensitive to the assumptions made in calculating it.
This gives rise to a large range of potential outcomes which require judgement in determining an appropriate provision level.
See below for information on payment protection redress and Note 29 for more detail of legal, competition and regulatory matters.
Accounting for provisions The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets in accounting for non-financial liabilities.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs when an obligation exists: for example, when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.
Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.
Onerous contracts Onerous contract provisions comprise an estimate of the costs involved with fulfilling the terms and conditions of contracts net of any expected benefits to be received.
Redundancy and restructuring These provisions comprise the estimated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs where an obligation exists.
Additions made during the year relate to formal restructuring plans and have either been utilised, or reversed, where total costs are now expected to be lower than the original provision amount.
Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees Provisions are made if it is probable that a facility will be drawn and the resulting asset is expected to have a realisable value that is less than the amount advanced.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 283 Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 27 Provisions continued Customer redress Customer redress provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for losses or damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of Barclays business activities.
Provisions for other customer redress include 211m 2016: 264m in respect of historic pricing practices associated with Foreign Exchange transactions for certain customers between 2005 and 2012 and smaller provisions across the retail and corporate businesses which are likely to be utilised in the next 12 months.
Included within provisions for UK customer redress on the face of the consolidated income statement is PPI and material additions in respect of historic pricing practices associated with Foreign Exchange transactions for certain customers between 2005 and 2012 and Packaged Bank Accounts.
Legal, competition and regulatory matters The Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US.
For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, please refer to Note 29.
Sundry provisions This category includes provisions that do not fit into any of the other categories, such as fraud losses and dilapidation provisions.
Payment Protection Insurance Redress As at 31 December 2017, Barclays had recognised cumulative provisions totalling 9.2bn 2016: 8.4bn against the cost of Payment Protection Insurance PPI redress and associated processing costs with utilisation of 7.6bn 2016: 6.4bn, leaving a residual provision of 1.6bn 2016: 2.0bn.
a Through to 31 December 2017, 2.1m 2016: 1.8m customer initiated claims had been received and processed.
The volume of claims received during 2017 increased 16 from 2016.
This increase may have been impacted by a FCA advertising campaign launched in H2 2017.
The current provision reflects the estimated costs of PPI redress primarily relating to customer initiated complaints and ongoing remediation programmes, based on information at year end.
This also includes liabilities managed by third parties arising from portfolios previously sold where Barclays remains liable, based on information at year end.
As at 31 December 2017, the provision of 1.6bn represents Barclays best estimate of expected PPI redress reflecting the complaints deadline implemented by the FCA of 29 August 2019.
However, it is possible the eventual outcome may differ from the current estimate.
We will continue to review the adequacy of provision level in respect of the future impacts.
The PPI provision is calculated using a number of key assumptions which continue to involve significant modelling and management judgement: Customer initiated claim volumes claims received but not yet processed plus an estimate of future claims initiated by customers, where the volume is anticipated to cease after the PPI deadline.
Average claim redress the expected average payment to customers for upheld claims based on the type and age of the policy policies.
Processing cost per claim the cost to Barclays of assessing and processing each valid claim.
These assumptions remain subjective, mainly due to the uncertainty associated with future claims levels, which include complaints driven by CMC activity and the FCA advertising campaign.
The following table details actual data through to 31 December 2017, key forecast assumptions used in the provision calculation and a sensitivity analysis illustrating the impact on the provision if the future expected assumptions prove too high or too low.
a Customer initiated claims received and processed thousands 2,130 570 50k 104m b Average uphold rate per claim 87 87 1% 11m c Average redress per valid claim 2,036 1,989 100 50m Notes a Total claims received directly by Barclays to date, including those received via claims management companies but excluding those for which no PPI policy exists and excluding responses to proactive mailing.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated to show the impact a 50,000 increase or decrease in the number of customer initiated claims would have on the provision level.
b Average uphold rate per customer initiated claims received directly by Barclays and proactive mailings, excluding those for which no PPI policy exists.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated to show the impact a 1% change in the average uphold rate per claim would have on the provision level.
c Average redress stated on a per policy basis for future customer initiated complaints received directly by Barclays.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated to show the impact a 100 increase or decrease in the average redress per claim would have on the provision level.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 28 Contingent liabilities and commitments Accounting for contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the outflow of economic resources is remote.
The following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on-balance sheet: Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security 14,275 15,303 Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements 4,737 4,636 Total contingent liabilities 19,012 19,939 Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions 812 1,005 Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments 314,761 302,681 Total commitments 315,573 303,686 The Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme the FSCS is the UKs government-backed compensation scheme for customers of authorised institutions that are unable to pay claims.
The compensation paid out to customers is funded through loan facilities provided by HM Treasury to the FSCS which at 31 December 2017 stood at approximately 4.7bn 2016: 15.7bn.
During 2017, the HM Treasury loan facility has reduced by the Bradford and Bingley repayment of 10.9bn, following the sale from UK Asset Resolution.
Barclays liability is restricted to the proportionate outstanding amount that the FSCS is unable to repay to Treasury.
The FSCS levy on UK licensed deposit taking institutions has been recognised in 2017.
Barclays has included an accrual of 2.7m in other liabilities as at 31 December 2017 2016: 55m in respect of the Barclays portion of the Interest Levy.
Further details on contingent liabilities relating to legal and competition and regulatory matters can be found in Note 29.
29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and the Group face legal, competition and regulatory challenges, many of which are beyond our control.
The extent of the impact on Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and the Group of these matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects.
Matters arising from a set of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.
The recognition of provisions in relation to such matters involves critical accounting estimates and judgments in accordance with the relevant accounting policies as described in Note 27.
The Group has not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial effect on the Group of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so.
Investigations into certain advisory services agreements and other matters and civil action The UK Serious Fraud Office SFO, the Financial Conduct Authority FCA, the US Department of Justice DOJ and the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC have been conducting investigations into certain advisory services agreements entered into by Barclays Bank PLC.
Background Information Barclays Bank PLC entered into two advisory services agreements with atar Holding LLC atar Holding in June and October 2008 the Agreements.
The FCA commenced an investigation into whether the Agreements may have related to Barclays PLCs capital raisings in June and November 2008 the Capital Raisings.
The existence of the June 2008 advisory services agreement was disclosed, but the entry into the advisory services agreement in October 2008 and the fees payable under the Agreements, which amounted to a total of 322m payable over a period of five years, were not disclosed in the announcements or public documents relating to the Capital Raisings.
The SFO also commenced an investigation into the Agreements and into a $3bn loan the Loan provided by Barclays Bank PLC in November 2008 to the State of atar.
SFO Proceedings In June 2017, the SFO charged Barclays PLC with two offences of conspiring with certain former senior officers and employees of Barclays to commit fraud by false representations relating to the Agreements and one offence of unlawful financial assistance contrary to section 151 of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to the Loan.
In February 2018, the SFO also charged Barclays Bank PLC with the same offence in respect of the Loan.
Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC intend to defend the respective charges brought against them the Charges.
The trial of the Charges has been scheduled to begin in January 2019.
FCA Proceedings and other investigations In September 2013, the FCA issued warning notices the Notices finding that, while Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC believed at the time of the execution of the Agreements that there should be at least some unspecified and undetermined value to be derived from them, the primary purpose of the Agreements was not to obtain advisory services but to make additional payments, which would not be disclosed, for the atari participation in the Capital Raisings.
The Notices concluded that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC were in breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules and Barclays PLC was also in breach of Listing Principle 3 the requirement to act with integrity towards holders and potential holders of the Companys shares.
In this regard, the FCA considers that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly.
The financial penalty provided in the Notices against the Group is 50m.
Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC continue to contest the findings.
The FCA action has been stayed due to the SFO proceedings.
In addition, the DOJ and the SEC have been conducting investigations relating to the Agreements.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 285 Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued Civil Action In January 2016, PCP Capital Partners LLP and PCP International Finance Limited PCP served a claim on Barclays Bank PLC seeking damages of 721.4m plus interest and costs for fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit, arising from alleged statements made by Barclays Bank PLC to PCP in relation to the terms on which securities were to be issued to potential investors, allegedly including PCP, in the November 2008 capital raising.
Following amendment of their claim in November 2017, PCP now seeks damages of up to 1,477m plus interest from November 2017 and costs.
Barclays Bank PLC is defending the claim and trial is scheduled to commence in October 2019.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact It is not currently practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the actions described on the Group or what effect that they might have upon the Groups operating results, cash flows or financial position in any particular period.
PCP has made a claim against Barclays Bank PLC for damages of up to 1,477m plus interest and costs.
This amount does not necessarily reflect Barclays Bank PLCs potential financial exposure if a ruling were to be made against it in that matter.
Investigations into certain business relationships In 2012, the DOJ and SEC commenced investigations in relation to whether certain relationships with third parties who assist Barclays PLC to win or retain business are compliant with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Various regulators in other jurisdictions are also being briefed on the investigations.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Employee benefits The notes included in this section focus on the costs and commitments associated with employing our staff.
34 Share-based payments Accounting for share-based payments The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares.
Employee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase shares on favourable terms.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services.
The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.
The number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met.
Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.
The fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability.
The fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest.
These take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors.
Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions such as continuing to make payments into a share-based savings scheme.
The charge for the year arising from share-based payment schemes was as follows: Charge for the year 2017 2016 2015 m m m Share Value Plan 153 473 442 Deferred Share Value Plan 166 Others 186 192 86 Total equity settled 505 665 528 Cash settled 3 1 4 Total share-based payments 508 666 532 The terms of the main current plans are as follows: Share Value Plan SVP The SVP was introduced in March 2010 and approved by shareholders for executive Director participation and use of new issue shares at the AGM in April 2011.
SVP awards are granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three, five or seven years.
Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares.
The grantor may also make a dividend equivalent payment to participants on release of a SVP award.
SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.
Deferred Share Value Plan DSVP The DSVP was introduced in February 2017.
The terms of the DSVP are materially the same as the terms of the SVP as described above, save that executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the DSVP and the DSVP operates over market purchase shares only.
The accounting policies for employee benefits are included in Note 8.
Other schemes In addition to the SVP and DSVP, the Group operates a number of other schemes including schemes operated by, and settled in, the shares of subsidiary undertakings, none of which is individually or in aggregate material in relation to the charge for the year or the dilutive effect of outstanding share options.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 35 Pensions and post-retirement benefits Accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes and post-employment benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes the Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
Defined benefit schemes the Group recognises its obligations to members of each scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets after applying the asset ceiling test.
The Group will keep the developments on the proposed amendments to IFRIC14 under review.
Each schemes obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.
Changes in pension scheme liabilities or assets remeasurements that do not arise from regular pension cost, net interest on net defined benefit liabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred, the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, return on scheme assets excluding amounts included in the interest on the assets and any changes in the effect of the asset ceiling restriction excluding amounts included in the interest on the restriction.
Post-employment benefit schemes the cost of providing health care benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.
Pension schemes UK Retirement Fund UKRF The UKRF is the Groups main scheme, representing 96% of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations.
The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises 10 sections, the two most significant of which are: Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element.
The cash balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index RPI up to a maximum of 5% p. a.. An increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays discretion.
Between 1 October 2003 and 1 October 2012 the majority of new UK employees except for the employees of the investment banking business within Barclays International were eligible to join this section.
The costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits for Afterwork members are borne by the UKRF.
The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are limited although additional contributions are required if pre-retirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits.
Most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010.
Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary.
From 1 April 2010, members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or the Pension Investment Plan PIP, a historic defined contribution section which is now closed to future contributions.
The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 section are typical of final salary pension schemes, principally that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected.
Barclays Pension Savings Plan BPSP From 1 October 2012, a new UK pension scheme, the BPSP, was established to satisfy Auto Enrolment legislation.
The BPSP is a defined contribution scheme Group Personal Pension providing benefits for all new Barclays UK hires from 1 October 2012, employees of the investment banking business within Barclays International who were in PIP as at 1 October 2012, and also all UK employees who were not members of a pension scheme at that date.
As a defined contribution scheme, BPSP is not subject to the same investment return, inflation or life expectancy risks for Barclays that defined benefit schemes are.
Members benefits reflect contributions paid and the level of investment returns achieved.
Other Apart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and post-retirement health care plans globally, the largest of which are the US defined benefit schemes.
Many of the schemes are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts.
Others are operated on an unfunded basis.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding, and the legal basis of the schemes, reflect local environments.
Governance The UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation.
The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Group.
The Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays and who are not members of the UKRF, plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff and pensioner members who apply for the role.
The BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans.
Each personal pension plan is a direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, and is regulated by the FCA.
Similar principles of pension governance apply to the Groups other pension schemes, depending on local legislation.

As at 31 December 2017, the UKRFs scheme assets were in surplus versus IAS 19 obligations by 952m 2016: deficit of 27m.
The movement for the UKRF is mainly due to payment of deficit contributions, higher than assumed asset returns, updated mortality assumptions, and lower expected future price inflation, offset by a decrease in discount rate, transfers out of the scheme, and the introduction of an assumption for future transfers out.
Of the 4,927m 2016: 1,800m UKRF benefits paid out, 4,151m 2016: 1,029m related to transfers out of the fund.
Where a schemes assets exceed its obligation, an asset is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution holidays or refunds of contributions the asset ceiling.
In the case of the UKRF the asset ceiling is not applied as, in certain specified circumstances such as wind-up, Barclays expects to be able to recover any surplus.
The Trustee does not have a substantive right to augment benefits, nor do they have the right to wind up the plan except in the dissolution of the Group or termination of contributions by the Group.
The application of the asset ceiling to other plans is considered on an individual plan basis.
302 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 35 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements Actuarial valuation of the schemes obligation is dependent upon a series of assumptions.
Below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for the UKRF.
2017 2016 Key UKRF financial assumptions % p. a.
Discount rate 2.46 2.62 Inflation rate RPI 3.22 3.35 The UKRF discount rate assumption for 2017 was based on a variant of the standard Willis Towers Watson RATE Link model.
This variant includes all bonds rated AA by at least one of the four major ratings agencies, and assumes that yields after year 30 are flat.
The RPI inflation assumption for 2017 was set by reference to the Bank of Englands implied inflation spot curve, assuming the spot curve remains flat after 30 years.
The inflation assumption incorporates a deduction of 20 basis points as an allowance for an inflation risk premium.
The methodology used to derive the discount rate and price inflation assumptions is consistent with that used at the prior year end, except the inflation spot curve was held flat after 25 years at 2016.
The UKRFs post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2016 of Barclays own post-retirement mortality experience, and taking account of recent evidence from published mortality surveys.
An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the 2016 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a long-term trend of 1.25% pa in future improvements.
The methodology used is consistent with the prior year end, except that the 2015 core projection model was used at 2016.
The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the past three years: Assumed life expectancy 2017 2016 2015 Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners years Males 27.8 27.9 28.4 Females 29.4 29.7 30.0 Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 years Males 29.3 29.7 30.2 Females 31.0 31.7 32.0 An assumption for future transfers out has been introduced at 2017, increasing the benefit obligation by about 2%, as numbers of deferred members transferring out were at higher levels in 2017 than previously experienced.
The assumption introduced is that 20% of the benefit obligations in respect of deferred members will transfer out during 2018, 15% in 2019, 10% in 2020, 5% in 2021, tapering down to 0% from 2022 onwards.
The assumption used at 2016 was nil transfers out.
Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions The sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and keeping the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other assumptions that depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly.
The difference between the recalculated liability figure and that stated in the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown.
The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to key assumptions should not be interpreted as Barclays expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 303 Notes to the financial statements Employee benefits 35 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued Assets A long-term investment strategy has been set for the UKRF, with its asset allocation comprising a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate assets.
This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others.
The long-term investment strategy ensures, among other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.
Asset managers are permitted some flexibility to vary the asset allocation from the long-term investment strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.
The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely to liabilities.
The value of assets shown reflects the assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reflected on a fair value basis.
The value of the assets of the schemes and their percentage in relation to total scheme assets were as follows: Analysis of scheme assets Total Of which relates to UKRF % of total % of total fair value of fair value of scheme scheme Value assets Value assets m % m % As at 31 December 2017 Equities quoted 4,377 14.1 4,151 13.8 Equities non-quoted 2,001 6.5 2,001 6.6 a Bonds fixed government 2,433 7.9 2,184 7.3 a Bonds index-linked government 13,089 42.3 13,078 43.4 a Bonds corporate and other 5,195 16.8 4,999 16.6 b Property commercial 1,911 6.2 1,902 6.3 b Derivatives 816 2.6 816 2.7 c Other 1,100 3.6 981 3.3 Fair value of scheme assets 30,922 100.0 30,112 100.0 As at 31 December 2016 Equities quoted 8,123 24.9 7,840 24.6 Equities non-quoted 2,043 6.3 2,042 6.4 a Bonds fixed government 1,330 4.1 1,072 3.4 a Bonds index-linked government 13,173 40.3 13,165 41.4 a Bonds corporate and other 5,222 16.0 5,054 15.9 b Property commercial 1,630 5.0 1,622 5.1 b Derivatives 870 2.7 870 2.7 c Other 266 0.7 155 0.5 Fair value of scheme assets 32,657 100.0 31,820 100.0 Notes a Assets held are predominately quoted.

Included within the fair value of scheme assets were: 0.1m 2016: 0.2m relating to shares in Barclays PLC and 0.6m 2016: 0.1m relating to bonds issued by Barclays PLC.
The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by Barclays PLC.
The UKRF scheme assets also include 15m 2016: 32m relating to UK private equity investments and 1,986m 2016: 2,009m relating to overseas private equity investments.
These are disclosed above within Equities non-quoted.
Approximately 48% of the UKRF assets are invested in liability-driven investment strategies: primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation swaps.
These are used to better match the assets to its liabilities.
The swaps are used to reduce the schemes inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.
Funding The Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the UKRF funding position in addition to the full triennial actuarial valuation.
The latest annual update was carried out as at 30 September 2017 and showed a deficit of 4.8bn and a funding level of 86.8%.
The last triennial actuarial valuation of the UKRF had an effective date of 30 September 2016 and was completed in July 2017.
This valuation showed a funding deficit of 7.9bn and a funding level of 81.5%, versus 6.0bn funding deficit at the 30 September 2015 update.
The improvement in funding position between 30 September 2016 and 30 September 2017 was largely due to payment of deficit contributions, higher than assumed asset returns, higher Government bond yields, and transfers out of the scheme.
304 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 35 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued At the 2016 triennial actuarial valuation the Group and UKRF Trustee agreed a revised scheme-specific funding target, statement of funding principles, schedule of contributions, a recovery plan to seek to eliminate the deficit relative to the funding target and some additional support measures.
The agreement with the UKRF Trustee also takes into account the changes to the Group structure that will be implemented as a result a of ring-fencing.
Barclays Bank PLC will remain as the principal employer of the UKRF.
The main differences between the funding and IAS 19 assumptions were a different approach to setting the discount rate and a more conservative longevity assumption for funding.
The deficit reduction contributions agreed with the UKRF Trustee as part of the 30 September 2016 valuation recovery plan are shown alongside the deficit recovery contributions agreed in 2014 for the prior 30 September 2013 valuation.

b The 2017 deficit contributions from the 30 September 2013 valuation included up to 500m payable if the deficit in 2017 exceeded a certain level.
Of this 500m, 250m was paid during the first half of 2017.
Following the agreement of the 30 September 2016 valuation recovery plan, in July 2017, the remaining payments were no longer required.
The deficit reduction contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Groups share of the cost of benefits accruing over each year.
The next funding valuation of the UKRF is due to be completed in 2020 with an effective date of 30 September 2019.
Other support measures agreed at the same time as the valuation Collateral The UKRF Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC have entered into an arrangement whereby a collateral pool has been put in place to provide security for the UKRF funding deficit as it increases or decreases over time, and associated deficit recovery contributions.
The collateral pool is currently made up of government securities and high quality securitisations of credit cards, mortgages and corporate loans.
Agreement has been made with the Trustee to increase the proportion of the deficit covered from 88.5% to 100% effective from 26 March 2018 with an overall cap remaining of 9.0bn, at which date the collateral pool will consist of government securities only the Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC may agree alternative eligible collateral in the future.
The arrangement provides the UKRF Trustee with dedicated access to the pool of assets in the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution to the UKRF or in the event of Barclays Bank PLCs insolvency.
These assets are included within Note 40.
Support from Barclays PLC In the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution payment required under the 2016 valuation recovery plan by a specified pre-payment date, Barclays PLC has entered into an arrangement whereby it will be required to use, in first priority, dividends received from Barclays Bank UK PLC if any to invest the proceeds in Barclays Bank PLC up to the maximum amount of the deficit reduction contribution unpaid by Barclays Bank PLC.
The proceeds of the investment will be used to discharge Barclays Bank PLCs unpaid deficit reduction contribution.
Participation As permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Banking Reform Pensions Regulations 2015, Barclays Bank UK PLC is a participating employer in the UKRF and will remain so during a transitional phase until September 2025 as set out in a deed of participation.
Barclays Bank UK PLC will make contributions for the future service of its employees who are currently Afterwork members and, in the event of Barclays Bank PLCs insolvency during this period provision has been made to require Barclays Bank UK PLC to become the principal employer of the UKRF.
Barclays Bank PLCs Section 75 debt would be triggered by the insolvency the debt would be calculated after allowing for the payment to the UKRF of the collateral above.
Defined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows: Contributions paid m 2017 1,124 2016 634 2015 586 Included within the Groups contributions paid were 153m 2016: 112m: 2015: nil Section 75 contributions.
The Groups expected contribution to the UKRF in respect of defined benefits in 2018 is 716m 2017: 1,585m.
In addition, the expected contributions to UK defined contribution schemes in 2018 is 35m 2017: 36m to the UKRF and 146m 2017: 124m to the BPSP.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 305 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation The section presents information on the Groups investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and its interests in structured entities.
Detail is also given on securitisation transactions the Group has entered into and arrangements that are held off-balance sheet.
36 Principal subsidiaries Barclays applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control.
Under IFRS 10, this is when the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The Group reassesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to its power, its rights to variable returns or its ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
The significant judgements used in applying this policy are set out below.
Accounting for investment in subsidiaries In the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment.
Principal subsidiaries for the Group are set out below.
This includes those subsidiaries that are most significant in the context of the Groups business, results or financial position.

Ownership interests are in some cases different to voting interests due to the existence of non-voting equity interests, such as preference shares.
Refer to Note 33 for more information.
Barclays Africa Group Limited was considered a principal subsidiary in 2016.
During 2017 Barclays reduced its shareholding in BAGL.
This resulted in the deconsolidation of BAGL from the Group as of 1 June 2017, with the residual holding recognised as an available for sale investment.
Determining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital.
However, in certain instances, this determination will involve judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities.
This judgement may involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity.
It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.
There is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities.
In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors exposures to the structures variable returns have been substantively eliminated, the Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will consolidate the structured entity.
An interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% would typically indicate that the Group has control of an entity.
However, the entity set out below is excluded from consolidation because the Group does not have exposure to its variable returns.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 36 Principal subsidiaries continued This entity is managed by an external counterparty and consequently is not controlled by the Group.
Interests relating to this entity are included in Note 37.
Significant restrictions As is typical for a Group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its Group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests.
Regulatory requirements Barclays principal subsidiary companies have assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of 1,407bn 2016: 1,553bn and 1,341bn 2016: 1,480bn respectively.
The assets and liabilities are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated.
These require entities to maintain minimum capital levels which cannot be returned to the Parent company, Barclays PLC on a going concern basis.
In order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may hold certain equity-accounted and debt-accounted issued financial instruments and non-equity instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liabilities.
Refer to Note 33 and Note 30 for particulars of these instruments.
These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share restrictions that would limit the ability of the entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.
Liquidity requirements Regulated subsidiaries of the Group are required to meet PRA and local regulatory requirements pertaining to liquidity.
Some of the subsidiaries affected are Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Inc which must maintain daily compliance with the regulatory minimum.
See pages 166 to 178 for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of our significant subsidiaries.
Statutory requirements The Groups subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally to maintain solvency.
These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the ultimate parent, except in the event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation.
In most cases, the regulatory restrictions referred to above exceed the statutory restrictions.
Contractual requirements Asset encumbrance The Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks.
Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group.
The assets typically affected are disclosed in Note 40.
Assets held by consolidated structured entities None of the assets 2016: 99m included in the Groups balance sheet relate to consolidated investment funds, held to pay return and principal to the holders of units in the funds.
Any assets held in these funds cannot be transferred to other members of the Group.
The decrease since 2016 is due to the sale of the French Funds Business.
Other restrictions The Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities, and these amounted to 3,360m 2016: 4,254m.
37 Structured entities A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control.
Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.
Depending on the Groups power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity.
In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.
Consolidated structured entities The Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated structured entities: Securitisation vehicles The Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer.
Refer to Note 39 for further detail.
The Group, in previous periods, has provided liquidity facilities to certain securitisation vehicles.
At 31 December 2017, there were no outstanding loan commitments to these entities 2016: 152m.
Commercial paper CP and medium-term note conduits The Group provided 10.2bn 2016: 9bn in undrawn contractual backstop liquidity facilities to CP conduits.
Fund management entities In previous periods, Barclays had contractually guaranteed the performance of certain cash investments in a number of managed investment funds which resulted in their consolidation.
As at 31 December 2017, the notional value of the guarantees were nil 2016: 99m as the European Wealth Funds associated with these guarantees were either closed or ownership has been transferred outside the Group and they are no longer consolidated.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 307 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 37 Structured entities continued Employee benefit and other trusts The Group provides capital contributions to employee share trusts to enable them to meet their obligations to employees under share-based payment plans.
During 2017, the Group provided undrawn liquidity facilities of 1.8bn 2016: 0.4bn to certain trusts.
Unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group has an interest An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Group.
Such interests include holdings of debt or equity securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from the entity to the Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and investment management agreements.
Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in the payment waterfall of a securitisation and derivatives that are determined to introduce risk or variability to a structured entity are not considered to be an interest in an entity and have been excluded from the disclosures below.
The nature and extent of the Groups interests in structured entities is summarised below: Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities Short-term Secured traded Traded Other financing interests derivatives interests Total m m m m m As at 31 December 2017 Assets Trading portfolio assets 10,788 699 11,487 Financial assets designated at fair value 31,520 2,721 34,241 Derivative financial instruments 4,380 4,380 Loans and advances to banks Loans and advances to customers 5,481 17,386 22,867 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending 753 753 Other assets 509 509 Total assets 37,754 10,788 4,380 21,315 74,237 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 5,193 3,356 8,549 As at 31 December 2016 Assets Trading portfolio assets 8,436 516 8,952 Financial assets designated at fair value 22,706 367 23,073 Derivative financial instruments 4,731 2,130 6,861 Loans and advances to banks 4,915 4,915 Loans and advances to customers 24,142 24,142 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending 6,338 6,338 Other assets 919 919 Total assets 29,044 8,436 4,731 32,989 75,200 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 3,567 2,130 5,697 Secured financing arrangements, short-term traded interests and traded derivatives are typically managed under market risk management policies described on page 129 which includes an indication of the change of risk measures compared to last year.
For this reason, the total assets of these entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of understanding the related risks and so have not been presented.
Other interests include conduits and lending where the interest is driven by normal customer demand.
Secured financing The Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal commercial terms where the counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity.
Due to the nature of these arrangements, especially the transfer of collateral and ongoing margining, the Group has minimal exposure to the performance of the structured entity counterparty.
This includes margin lending which is presented under Loans and advances to customers in 2017 to align to the balance sheet presentation.
In 2016 margin lending was presented in Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending within Note 37.
A description of these transactions is included in Note 22.
Short-term traded interests The Group buys and sells interests in structured entities as part of its trading activities, for example, retail mortgage backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar interests.
Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 days.
In such cases, the Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.
As at 31 December 2017, 9,645m 2016: 6,568m of the Groups 10,788m 2016: 8,436m short-term traded interests were comprised of debt securities issued by asset securitisation vehicles.
308 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 37 Structured entities continued Traded derivatives The Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit indices among other things.
The main derivative types which are considered interests in structured entities include index-based and entity specific credit default swaps, balance guaranteed swaps, total return swaps, commodities swaps, and equity swaps.
A description of the types of derivatives and the risk management practices are detailed in Note 15.
The risk of loss may be mitigated through ongoing margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from the structured entity which are senior in the payment waterfall.
Such margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the Groups normal credit policies.
Derivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk.
The Group is mainly exposed to settlement risk on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining.
Except for credit default swaps where the maximum exposure to loss is the swap notional amount, it is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure to loss in respect of derivative positions as the fair value of derivatives is subject to changes in market rates of interest, exchange rates and credit indices which by their nature are uncertain.
In addition, the Groups losses would be subject to mitigating action under its traded market risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty to provide collateral in cash or other assets in most cases.
Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities The Groups interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short-term trading activities are set out below, summarised by the purpose of the entities and limited to significant categories, based on maximum exposure to loss.

Exposure to loss is mitigated through collateral, financial guarantees, the availability of netting and credit protection held.
Multi-seller conduit programme The multi-seller conduit engages in providing financing to various clients and holds whole or partial interests in pools of receivables or similar obligations.
These instruments are protected from loss through , seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduit.
The Groups off-balance sheet exposure included in the table above represents liquidity facilities that are provided to the conduit for the benefit of the holders of the commercial paper issued by the conduit and will only be drawn where the conduit is unable to access the commercial paper market.
If these liquidity facilities are drawn, the Group is protected from loss through , seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduit.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 309 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 37 Structured entities continued Lending The portfolio includes lending provided by the Group to unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of its lending business to earn income in the form of interest and lending fees and includes loans to structured entities that are generally collateralised by property, equipment or other assets.
All loans are subject to the Groups credit sanctioning process.
Collateral arrangements are specific to the circumstances of each loan with additional guarantees and collateral sought from the sponsor of the structured entity for certain arrangements.
During the period the Group incurred an impairment of 11m 2016: 24m against such facilities.
Investment funds and trusts In the course of its fund management activities, the Group establishes pooled investment funds that comprise investments of various kinds, tailored to meet certain investors requirements.
The Groups interest in funds is generally restricted to a fund management fee, the value of which is typically based on the performance of the fund.
The Group acts as trustee to a number of trusts established by or on behalf of its clients.
The purpose of the trusts, which meet the definition of structured entities, is to hold assets on behalf of beneficiaries.
The Groups interest in trusts is generally restricted to unpaid fees which, depending on the trust, may be fixed or based on the value of the trust assets.
Barclays has no other risk exposure to the trusts.
Other This includes fair value loans with structured entities where the market risk is materially hedged with corresponding derivative contracts, interests in debt securities issued by securitisation vehicles and drawn and undrawn loan facilities to these entities.
Assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities Assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities were immaterial.
38 Investments in associates and joint ventures Accounting for associates and joint ventures Barclays applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies.
Generally the Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their voting shares.
Joint ventures are arrangements where the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and increased or decreased each year by the Groups share of the post acquisition profit loss.
The Group ceases to recognise its share of the losses of equity accounted associates when its share of the net assets and amounts due from the entity have been written off in full, unless it has a contractual or constructive obligation to make good its share of the losses.
In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those held by private equity businesses.
There are no individually significant investments in joint ventures or associates held by Barclays.

In addition, the Group has made commitments to finance or otherwise provide resources to its joint ventures and associates of 246m 2016: 263m.
310 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 39 Securitisations Accounting for securitisations The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer.
Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction: lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets or to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
In the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either where legal rights to the cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficially, where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty.
Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.
A summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below: Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition Securitisations The Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its residential mortgage loans and credit card balances.
In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third party investors.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction.
Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet: 2017 2016 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Carrying Carrying Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m m m m m Loans and advances to customers Residential mortgage loans 125 120 107 107 Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending 3,772 3,757 3,635 3,626 5,094 5,084 4,926 4,931 Total 3,772 3,757 3,635 3,626 5,219 5,204 5,033 5,038 Balances included within loans and advances to customers represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been retained by the Group.
The relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual terms of their notes may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets.
For transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, refer to Note 22 and Note 40. home.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 311 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 39 Securitisations continued Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised In some cases, the Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it.
This arises in asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Groups involvement, mainly with CLOs and CMBS.
Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.
The table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement: Gain loss from continuing a Continuing involvement involvement Maximum Carrying exposure to For the Cumulative to amount Fair value loss year ended 31 December Type of transfer m m m m m 2017 CLO and other assets Commercial mortgage backed securities 94 94 94 1 1 Total 94 94 94 1 1 2016 CLO and other assets 10 10 10 3 Commercial mortgage backed securities Total 10 10 10 3 Note a Assets which represent the Groups continuing involvement in derecognised assets are recorded in Loans and advances and Trading portfolio assets.
40 Assets pledged Assets are pledged as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending agreements or as security deposits relating to derivatives.
Assets pledged as collateral include all assets categorised as encumbered in the disclosure on page 171 unaudited, other than those held in commercial paper conduits.
In these transactions, Barclays will be required to step in to provide financing itself under a liquidity facility if the vehicle cannot access the commercial paper market.
The following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security against these liabilities: 2017 2016 m m Trading portfolio assets 73,899 51,241 Financial assets at fair value 4,798 3,195 Loans and advances to customers 41,772 30,414 Cash collateral 56,351 68,797 Financial investments 15,058 13,053 Non current assets held for sale 117 Assets pledged 191,878 166,817 Barclays has an additional 9bn 2016: 14bn of loans and advances within its asset backed funding programmes that can readily be used to raise additional secured funding and are available to support future issuance.
Total assets pledged includes a collateral pool put in place to provide security for the UKRF funding deficit.
Refer to Note 35 for further details.
Collateral held as security for assets Under certain transactions, including reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing transactions, the Group is allowed to resell or re-pledge the collateral held.
The fair value at the balance sheet date of collateral accepted and re-pledged to others was as follows: 2017 2016 m m Fair value of securities accepted as collateral 608,412 466,975 Of which fair value of securities re-pledged transferred to others 547,637 405,582 Additional disclosure has been included in collateral and other credit enhancements see pages 140 to 141.

The 70bn decrease in assets is driven by the disposals of BAGL 65bn, the French retail business 4bn, the Egypt business 1bn, Barclays Vida Pensiones 0.7bn and the Zimbabwe business 0.4bn.
The associated liabilities of the above disposal groups have also been sold in the year.
Discontinued Operations On 1 March 2016, Barclays announced its intention to reduce the Groups 62.3% interest in BAGL to a level which would permit Barclays to deconsolidate BAGL from a regulatory perspective and, prior to that, from an accounting perspective.
From this date, BAGL was treated as a discontinued operation.
On 5 May 2016, Barclays sold 12.2% of the Groups interest in BAGL and on 1 June 2017 Barclays sold a further 33.7% of BAGLs issued share capital, resulting in the accounting deconsolidation of BAGL from the Barclays Group.
As a result, as of 1 June 2017 BAGL was consequently no longer reported as a discontinued operation.
At this time, Barclays holding in BAGL technically met the requirements to be treated as an Associate.
However, following a revision of its governance rights in July 2017 and the difference being immaterial, the holding was treated as an Available for Sale AFS asset from the transaction date.
In Q317 Barclays contributed 1.5% of BAGLs ordinary shares to a Black Economic Empowerment scheme, resulting in Barclays accounting for 126 million ordinary shares in BAGL, representing 14.9% of BAGLs issued share capital.
The retained investment is reported as an Available for Sale AFS asset, in the Head Office segment, with Barclays share of BAGLs dividend recognised in the Head Office income statement.
Prior to the disposal of shares on 1 June 2017, BAGL met the requirements for presentation as a discontinued operation.
As such, the results, which have been presented as the profit after tax and non-controlling interest in respect of the discontinued operation on the face of the Group income statement, are analysed in the income statement below.
The income statement, statement of other comprehensive income and cash flow statement below represent five months of results as a discontinued operation to 31 May 2017, compared to the full year ended 31 December 2016.

Non-Current Assets and Liabilities Investment in subsidiaries The investment in subsidiaries of 39,354m 2016: 36,553m predominantly represents investments made into Barclays Bank PLC, including 8,986m 2016: 6,486m of AT1 securities.
The increase of 2,801m during the year was driven by AT1 issuances of 2,500m during the period, as well as a 300m investment in Barclays Services Limited the Group Service Company.
The Group Service Company was established in September 2017 as a direct subsidiary of Barclays PLC to deliver operational continuity and to drive operational efficiencies across the Group.
In September 2017, Barclays transferred c. 3.8bn of assets and liabilities from Barclays Bank PLC and its subsidiaries to the Group Service Company.
Loans and advances to subsidiaries, subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue During the period, Barclays PLC issued $2bn of Fixed Rate Subordinated Notes, 1.5bn of Fixed Rate Subordinated Notes and SGD 0.2bn Fixed Rate Subordinated Notes included within the subordinated liabilities balance of 6,501m 2016: 3,789m, $5bn of Fixed and Floating Rate Senior Notes, 1.95bn of Fixed Rate Senior Notes and 0.5bn Fixed Rate Senior Notes included within the debt securities in issue balance of 22,110m 2016: 16,893m.
The proceeds raised through these transactions were used to invest in Barclays Bank PLC in each case with a ranking corresponding to the notes issued by Barclays PLC and included within the loans and advances to subsidiaries balance of 23,970m 2016: 19,421m.
Financial investments The financial investment assets relate to loans made to subsidiaries of the Group accounted for as AFS instruments.
These include a feature that allows for the loan to be written down in whole or in part by the borrower only in the event that the liabilities of the subsidiary would otherwise exceed its assets.
Derivative financial instrument The derivative financial instrument of 161m 2016: 268m held by the Parent Company represents Barclays PLCs right to receive a Capital Note for no additional consideration, in the event the Barclays PLC consolidated CRD IV CET1 ratio FSA October 2012 transitional statement falls below 7% at which point the notes are automatically assigned by the holders to Barclays PLC.
Management of internal investments, loans and advances Barclays PLC retains the discretion to manage the nature of its internal investments in subsidiaries according to their regulatory and business needs.
As we implement our structural reform programme, Barclays PLC expects to invest capital and funding in Barclays Bank PLC and other Group subsidiaries such as the Group Service Company, the US IHC and the UK ring-fenced bank.
In October 2017, the Bank of England published a consultation on Internal MREL and following that consultation a final statement of policy is expected to be published in H1 2018.
Accordingly, during the course of 2018 Barclays expects to restructure certain of its investments in subsidiaries, including to subordinate internal MREL beneath operating liabilities, to the extent required to achieve compliance with internal MREL requirements which are expected to be in effect from 1 January 2019.
Total equity Called up share capital and share premium of Barclays PLC was 22,045m 2016: 21,842m.
Other equity instruments of 8,943m 2016: 6,453m comprises of AT1 securities.
For further details please refer to Note 31.
Structural Reform Barclays plans for UK ring-fencing remain on track.
The relevant court processes began in November 2017 with the Sanction hearing to be held on 26 and 27 February 2018 at which the Court will be requested to sanction Barclays ring-fencing transfer scheme.
We intend to complete the reorganisation and establish the UK ring-fenced bank in April 2018, ahead of the 1 January 2019 legislative deadline for implementation.
