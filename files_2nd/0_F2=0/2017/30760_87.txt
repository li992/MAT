Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 58 Financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements and similar arrangements a Offsetting arrangements Financial assets and liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and has the intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Aviva mitigates credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into collateral agreements, where practical, and into ISDA master netting agreements for each of the legal entities to facilitate its right to offset credit risk exposure.
The credit support agreement will normally dictate the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aviva or its counterparty.
Derivative transactions requiring Aviva or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of over-the-counter derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and credit default swaps.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard long-term borrowing, derivative, securities lending and securities borrowing activities.
The derivative assets and liabilities in the table below are made up of the contracts described in detail in note 57.
Aviva participates in a number of stock lending and repurchase arrangements.
In some of these arrangements cash is exchanged by Aviva for securities and a related receivable is recognised within Loans to banks note 23.
These arrangements are reflected in the tables below.
In instances where the collateral is recognised on the statement of financial position, the obligation for its return is included within Payables and other financial liabilities.
In other arrangements, securities are exchanged for other securities.
The collateral received must be in a readily realisable form such as listed securities and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title always occurs for the collateral received.
In many instances, however, no market risk or economic benefit is exchanged and these transactions are not recognised on the statement of financial position in accordance with our accounting policies, and accordingly not included in the tables below.
