Share-based Payments 9.1 Accounting policy The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the total shareholder return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non-market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model.
For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
9.2 Pro t and loss account recognition The Company operates a number of different share-based payment schemes, the main features of which are detailed between pages 99 to 105 of the Directors Remuneration Report.
A total of 0.7m was charged to the pro t and loss account in the year with regard to share-based payments 2016: 0.5m.

The fair value of options with market-related performance conditions has been measured using the Monte Carlo model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the 2.8 years 2016: 2.75 years prior to the grant date.
The risk-free rate of return was assumed to be the yield to maturity on a UK xed gilt with the term to maturity equal to the expected life of the option.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, award holders receive the value of dividends that would have been paid on their vested shares in the period between grant and vesting.
Accordingly, there is no discount to the valuation for dividends foregone during the vesting period.
Contingent Liabilities Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2017 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to 563.4m 2016: 569.4m, which includes guarantees of $200.0m and 130.0m 2016: $310.0m and 30.0m in respect of US Private Placement Loan Notes and 146.3m 2016: 141.7m in respect of drawings under the syndicated bank facility: together with 150.8m 2016: 150.8m in relation to a guarantee provided to the Companys UK subsidiary which acts as Trustee for the Groups UK pension plan.
The guarantee is over all present and future pension liabilities of the plan and the contingent liability amount represents the net fide cit on a buy-out basis as shown in the most recent triennial valuation.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Companys subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Whilst the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
