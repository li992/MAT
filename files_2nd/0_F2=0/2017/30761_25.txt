Financial statements Notes to the Income Statement, Other Comprehensive Income and Distributions 8 Segmental information Group excluding disposals The Groups primary operating segments comprise Scandinavia, Canada, UK & International and Central Functions which is consistent with how the Group is managed.
The primary operating segments are based on geography and are all engaged in providing personal and commercial general insurance services.
Central Functions include the Groups internal reinsurance function and Group Corporate Centre.
Each operating segment is managed by a member of the Group Executive Committee who is directly accountable to the Group Chief Executive and Board of Directors, who together form the central decision making function in respect of the operating activities of the Group.
The UK is the Groups country of domicile and one of its principal markets.
Disposals Disposals are categorised between disposals of continuing operations and discontinued operations: Disposals of continuing operations On 7 February 2017, the Groups UK Legacy liabilities were disposed of to Enstar Group Limited.
The transaction initially takes the form of a reinsurance agreement, effective from 31 December 2016, which substantially effects economic transfer, to be followed by completion of a subsequent legal transfer of the business.
The Groups UK Legacy business is managed as part of the UK operations.
It is not presented as a discontinued operation as it is neither a separate geographical area nor a major line of business.
Discontinued operations During 2015, the Group classified the Latin American and Russian operations as discontinued as they were held for sale at 31 December 2015 and represented a separate geographical area of operation.
The sale of these operations completed in the first six months of 2016 and they were therefore classified as discontinued at 31 December 2016 see note 6 i for further details.
During 2017, no further operations have been classified as discontinued and as such, the 2016 comparatives do not require representation.
Assessing segment performance The Group uses the following key measures to assess the performance of its operating segments: Net written premiums: Underwriting result: Combined operating ratio COR : Operating result.
Net written premiums is the key measure of revenue used in internal reporting.
Underwriting result, COR and operating result are Alternative Performance Measures APMs, the key internal measures of profitability of the operating segments.
The COR reflects the ratio of claims costs and expenses including commission to earned premiums, expressed as a percentage.
Transfers or transactions between segments are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.

Performance Share Plan This plan is the Groups current Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Awards of performance shares to executive directors and other selected executives and senior managers are subject to performance conditions.
These consist of the Groups underlying return on tangible equity: relative total shareholder return: and business scorecard business review scorecard targets over a three year performance period.
Typically awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The Remuneration Committee may also make conditional awards of restricted shares to other executives and senior managers, which are not subject to performance conditions.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals gross bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as deferred bonus shares, which are also not subject to performance conditions.
If an employee resigns from the Group, then performance shares and restricted shares lapse at the date of leaving the Group.
Deferred Bonus Shares awards are generally retained by the employee to whom the award was granted if they leave the Group, unless the employee is dismissed for cause.
However, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to modify the treatment of leavers share awards that have yet to be released, based on the leaving circumstances, where this is appropriate and in shareholders interests.
Awards retained will vest on the normal vesting date.
Further information can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report within the Corporate Governance section.

20 Dividends paid and proposed The final dividend to equity holders is recognised as a liability when approved at the Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Company and its subsidiaries may be subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends they can pay to shareholders as a result of regulatory requirements.
However, based on the information currently available, the Group does not believe that such restrictions materially limit the ability to meet obligations or pay dividends.
At the AGM on 5 May 2018, a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 of 13.0p per ordinary share amounting to a total dividend of 133m is to be proposed.
The proposed dividend will be paid and accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 31 December 2018.
