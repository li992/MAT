Cushman & Wakefield are professionally qualified independent external valuers and had appropriate recent experience in the relevant location and category of the properties being valued.
The historical cost of investment properties at 30 November 2017 was 927.8m 2016 restated : 891.3m.
As at 30 November 2017, 790.2m 2016: 800.5m of investment property was pledged as security for the Groups loan facilities.
This security has subsequently been released as part of the Groups refinancing to move to unsecured facilities in December 2017, as disclosed in note 23.
Included within investment properties are 64.2m 2016: 61.7m of assets held under finance leases.
Fair value measurement disclosures IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement disclosures in respect of investment property are detailed below.
The following table provides an analysis of the categorisation of the Groups investment properties measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value: 2017 2016 restated m m Income producing properties Level 3 722.5 701.4 Residential assets Level 3 301.5 319.1 Commercial assets Level 3 139.3 120.3 1 Assets held under finance leases N A 5.2 3.9 Investment property 1,168.5 1,144.7 1 5.2m 2016: 3.9m of the Groups assets held under finance leases are not subject to valuation.
These assets represent head leases on certain investment property and are carried at the value recognised at inception less repayments of principal.
This does not include lease arrangements at Swansea University, which are subject to revaluation.
Income producing properties Income producing properties have been valued using the investment method which involves applying a yield to rental income streams.
Inputs include equivalent yields, current rent and estimated rental value ERV.
The resulting valuations are cross checked against the resulting initial yields and, for certain assets, the land value underpin if the assets were to be redeveloped.
Equivalent yields and ERV are considered to be unobservable inputs and details of the aggregate ERV and weighted average equivalent yields used for each category of income producing properties is provided in the following table: St. Modwen Properties PLC 148 Annual report and financial statements 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Aggregate ERV Weighted average equivalent yield Fair value at High yielding Investment High yielding 30 November 2017 properties portfolio properties Investment portfolio m m m % % Industrial and logistics 243.5 14.8 5.9 8.5 6.9 Retail 326.0 9.8 16.7 9.6 6.8 Residential and other 153.0 0.2 8.2 7.5 5.1 Total income producing properties 722.5 Aggregate ERV Weighted average equivalent yield Fair value at High yielding Investment High yielding Investment 30 November 2016 properties portfolio properties portfolio m m m % % Industrial and logistics 223.7 18.6 6.0 8.7 6.9 Retail 327.9 9.6 17.0 9.0 6.6 Residential and other 149.8 0.8 8.8 9.8 5.4 Total income producing properties 701.4 As the Group holds property both directly and through joint ventures and associates the strategic report discusses yields applied to investment property on a weighted average see-through basis.
This provides a composite position with respect to the Groups exposure to asset types by sector.
The aggregate ERVs and weighted average equivalent yields provided above are disclosed for those assets held by the Group excluding its joint ventures and associates.
The Groups portfolio has a wide spread of yields as it includes assets that are at various stages of the property lifecycle.
Income producing assets are generally acquired at high yields where the Group has the opportunity to add significant value.
As assets are enhanced and development activity is undertaken, improved and new assets are created and valued at lower yields.
All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset and an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.
However, there are inter-relationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact on these changes.
Residential assets Residential assets are valued using the residual development method.
To derive the value of land the valuers will estimate the gross development value of completed residential units on a site from which deductions will be made for build costs including costs to remediate and service land, finance costs and an appropriate profit margin.
Sales prices, build costs and profit margins are considered to be unobservable inputs and details of the ranges used are provided in the following table: Sales price Build costs Fair value per sq ft per sq ft Profit margin m % At 30 November 2017 301.5 148-345 85-120 20.0 At 30 November 2016 319.1 144-310 83-110 20.0 All other factors being equal, a higher sales price would lead to an increase in the valuation of an asset, a higher profit margin would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset, and a decrease in the build costs would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.
Commercial assets Commercial assets are valued on a land value per acre basis less costs to remediate and service the land.
Land value per acre is considered to be an unobservable input and details of the ranges used are detailed in the following table: Fair value Land value per acre m 000 At 30 November 2017 139.3 75-600 At 30 November 2016 120.3 75-500 All other things being equal, a higher value per acre would lead to an increase in the valuation of an asset and vice versa.
