This opinion is based on an assessment of each directors relevant knowledge and experience and the conclusion that, in each case, their informed opinions are of significant value and contribute greatly to board discussions.
The directors biographies can be found on page 29 of the 2017 annual report.
The directors consider that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of those shareholders.
Those directors who are shareholders will be voting in favour of the resolutions and unanimously recommend that you do so as well.
Explanatory notes to certain of the resolutions to be proposed at the annual general meeting Resolution 2: Directors remuneration report Shareholders are asked to approve the Directors Remuneration Report that appears on pages 46 to 63 other than the part containing the Directors Remuneration Policy, of the 2017 annual report and accounts.
This vote is advisory, and the directors entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on it.
Resolution 3: Directors remuneration policy The Company is required to seek shareholders approval of its policy on remuneration of directors the Directors Remuneration Policy at least every three years or when the policy changes.
As the current Directors Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2014 annual general meeting, a resolution is proposed this year in connection with approving the new Directors Remuneration Policy set out on pages 48 to 57 of the annual report and accounts.
Subject to shareholder approval, the policy would take effect from the close of the annual general meeting on 26 July 2017, and has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the views of our major shareholders.
Resolution 4: Declaration of final dividend Shareholders are being asked to approve a final dividend of 30.0pence per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2017.

In the meantime the Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte LLP Deloitte be re-appointed as auditor of the Company.
98 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The board intends to implement this recommendation and this proposal is set out in resolution 12.
Resolution 13 proposes that the directors be authorised to set the auditors remuneration.
Resolution 14: Directors authority to allot shares By virtue of section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 the Act, the directors require the authority of shareholders of the Company to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares.
The resolution numbered 14 authorises the directors to make allotments of up to 22,711,751 ordinary shares, representing approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares as at the date of this document.
If approved at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is passed, or on the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2018, whichever is the sooner.
The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority proposed to be conferred pursuant to resolution 14.
Resolution 15: Authority for disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights By virtue of section 561 of the Act, any issue by the Company of equity capital for cash made otherwise than to existing shareholders on a proportional basis requires the consent of shareholders of the Company unless the Company has obtained their authority under sections 570 and 573 of the Act.
The resolution numbered 15 is for that purpose.
It authorises the directors to allot shares by way of rights issue or pursuant to an open offer or otherwise than strictly pro rata when the directors consider that it is expedient to do so and also allows them to issue for cash up to 3,406,763 ordinary shares representing approximately five per cent of the issued share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares as at the date of this document other than on a pre-emptive basis.
If approved at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is passed or on the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2018, whichever is the sooner.
The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority proposed to be conferred pursuant to resolution 15.
Resolution 16: Authority to make market purchases of ordinary shares By virtue of section 701 of the Act, the Company may make market purchases of its own ordinary shares if authorised to do so by shareholders.
Under resolution 16, the directors seek to renew an annual authority to make market purchases of shares: each year the directors will seek to further renew this authority at the Companys annual general meeting.
Any ordinary shares purchased under this authority would either be i cancelled immediately on completion of the purchase and the number of ordinary shares in issue reduced accordingly: ii held, sold, transferred or otherwise dealt with as treasury shares in accordance with the provisions of the Act: or iii transferred to an employee benefit trust for the satisfaction of awards under the Companys existing share schemes.
The maximum number of ordinary shares which could be purchased under this authority is 6,813,525, being 10% of the issued share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares as at the date of this document.
Any repurchase of ordinary shares carried out by the Company would be at a maximum price per ordinary share of 105% of the average middle market price of such a share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase, the price equal to the last independent trade or the highest current independent bid and at a minimum price equal to the nominal value.
The authority to repurchase ordinary shares will, if approved by shareholders, only be exercised after careful consideration by the directors and if such exercise would result in an increase in earnings per share and be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Resolution 17: Authority to allow any general meeting of the Company that is not an annual general meeting to be called on not less than 14 clear days notice The minimum notice period for general meetings of listed companies is 21 days, but companies may reduce this period to 14 days other than for annual general meetings provided that: a the Company offers a facility for shareholders to vote by electronic means.
This condition is met if the Company has a facility enabling all shareholders to appoint a proxy by means of a website: and b on an annual basis, a shareholders resolution approving the reduction of the minimum notice period from 21 days to 14 days is passed.
The board is therefore proposing resolution 17 for a special resolution to approve 14 days as the minimum period of notice for all general meetings of the Company other than for annual general meetings.
The approval of this resolution will be effective until the end of the 2018 annual general meeting of the Company, when it is intended that the approval will be renewed.
The board intends that the shorter notice period will only be used in limited exceptional circumstances which are time-sensitive, rather than as a matter of routine, and only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
The directors do not have any current intention to exercise this authority but consider it appropriate to ensure that the Company has the necessary flexibility to respond to all eventualities.
