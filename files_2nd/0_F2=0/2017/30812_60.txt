Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 16 Derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivatives are determined based on market data primarily yield curves, implied volatilities and exchange rates to calculate the present value of all estimated flows associated with each derivative at the balance sheet date.
In the absence of sufficient market data, fair values would be based on the quoted market price of similar derivatives.
The classification of these derivative assets and liabilities under the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy is given in note 23.

These derivatives principally consist of forward foreign currency contracts which have not been designated as hedges due to their value changes offsetting with other components of net finance costs relating to financial assets and financial liabilities.
The Group do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All derivatives are undertaken for risk management purposes.
For cash flow hedges, the timing of expected cash flows is as follows: assets of 270 million 2016: 228 million of which 73 million 2016: 99 million is expected within one year and 165 million 2016: 106 million beyond 5 years and liabilities of 73 million 2016: 118 million of which 69 million 2016: 105 million is expected within one year.
The Groups cash flow hedges are principally in respect of sales or purchases of inventory and certain debt instruments.
A certain number of forward foreign currency contracts were used to manage the currency profile of external borrowings and are reflected in the currency table in note 20.
Interest rate swaps have been used to manage the interest rate profile of external borrowings and are reflected in the re-pricing table in note 20.
