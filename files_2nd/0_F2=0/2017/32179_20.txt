The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 12 June 2017.
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As a result of the relative size and historical volatility of share incentive scheme charges it has been decided to separately disclose the amounts on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, the amortisation of energy supply contract intangible asset has also been separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period.
More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 of these financial statements.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Statement of compliance The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
b Basis of preparation The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35.
The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 20 to 24 and within notes 12 and 19 to the financial statements.
In addition, notes 15 and 19 include the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of energy to the Companys Members.
This includes funding the Budget Plans of Members who pay for their energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.
The Company has from Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC total revolving credit facilities of 150.0 million for the period to 14 December 2020 of which Nil was drawn down as at 31 March 2017 2016: 71.2 million drawn down.
The Company has considerable financial resources together with a large and diverse retail and small business membership base and long term contracts with a number of key suppliers.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks.
On this basis the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The annual financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the FRCs Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 issued in October 2009.
94 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Basis of preparation continued The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical costs basis.
Post balance sheet events On 1 April 2017 the trading activities, the majority of the assets and liabilities, and the employees of Telecom Plus PLC, as well as all its subsidiaries, were transferred to Utility Warehouse Limited a 100% subsidiary of Telecom Plus PLC under a group reorganisation.
The reorganisation was designed to provide the Group with a more conventional legal structure in line with other large publicly-listed entities.
The reorganisation will not have any impact on the consolidated trading results of the Group going forward.
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have made judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future.
The judgements, estimations, and assumptions that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Estimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In future, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
i Revenue recognition Revenue relating to the sale of energy includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
This will have been estimated by using historical consumption patterns, prevailing weather data and other industry information.
Whilst the estimation routines are currently considered appropriate, a significant change in historical consumption patterns and or a failure to maintain the accuracy of the estimation routines could impact the amount of revenue recognised.
ii Intangible assets Energy Supply Contract The Group energy supply contract intangible assets relate to the entering into of the energy supply arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited from Npower Limited having effect from 1 December 2013.
The valuation of intangible assets represents a significant area of judgment as certain key assumptions are required in relation to the future financial performance of the assets.
Further detail regarding intangible assets is set out in note 6. iii Trade receivables Trade receivables largely represent customers who have energy debt assigned to a prepayment meter, or are in the process of having such a meter installed.
This requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements as to the expected level of eventual debt recovery from these customers based on historical experience.
While the provisions are currently considered to be appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic and regulatory conditions could lead to a change in the level of provisions recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income.
iv Share incentive scheme charges The Group has a conventional share option scheme for employees and Directors.
The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Binomial valuation model on the date of grant based on certain assumptions.
The assumptions used in the valuations are described in note 18 and include, amongst others, the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 95 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED v Metering contracts In 2017, as part of the smart meter rollout, the Group renewed rental arrangements with third-parties.
The Group assessed that these are not leases because it does not have the right to physically or operationally control the smart meters, other parties also take a significant amount of output from the assets, and when customers switch energy supplier, the responsibility for paying the third parties transfers to the new supplier.
By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of comprehensive income.
The Company made a profit for the year of 104,426,000 2016: 54,389,000 including dividends received from subsidiary companies of 20,000,000.
The following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Group during the current accounting period, but where relevant to the Group they have not had a material impact on the financial statements: Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle.
Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of financial statements, related to the disclosure initiative.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Control is recognised where an investor is expected to receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its investment in the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the relevant activities of the investee.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
ii Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
The Companys investment in associate Opus Energy Group Limited was sold during the year.
iii Employee Benefit Trusts In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of employee benefit trusts are consolidated in the Group financial statements.
Employee benefit trusts are treated as a legal entity separate from the Company but as subsidiaries of the Company.
Any loans made by the Company to employee benefit trusts are accounted for as loans in accordance with the relevant terms.
When the trust transfers shares to employees to satisfy share incentive scheme awards, this is considered to be, in substance, two transactions: a distribution of the shares from the employee benefit trust back to the Company as treasury shares, followed by a distribution of those shares to the employees.
96 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED d Revenue Overview Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent distributors excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
For each of the Groups main income streams from the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, transactions are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services or the supply of goods takes place.
The Groups customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services are provided.
The Group also generates revenue as a result of providing bill payment protection and accidental death cover to customers for a monthly fee.
The Group does not retain the insurance risk for these services.
Tariffs are set by Member, by service, and these can vary depending on the number of services provided.
Each element of any package is priced independently to arrive at the total package price.
Revenue recognition Energy services The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services to customers by the Group relies on estimates of usage where meter readings are not available.
These estimates are based on historical usage information adjusted for known factors such as variations in weather.
Revenue is recognised during the period in which the services are supplied and any unbilled revenue is accrued at each period end.
Revenue recognition Telephony services The Group principally generates revenue from providing the following telecommunications services: i fixed telephony line rental, call and broadband data charges: and ii mobile telephony call and data charges, and mobile handset sales.
Revenue for mobile handset sales are recognised when the devices are delivered to the end customer and the sale is considered complete.
Revenue recognition Other services The Group also generates revenues from providing Members with bill protection cover, and CashBack cards.
In addition the Group generates revenues from providing services to its network of independent distributors.
e Distributor commissions The Groups independent distributors earn commissions mainly on the introduction of new customers to the Group and on the ongoing monthly use of the Groups services by the customers they have introduced.
Commissions are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they are earned by distributors on an accruals basis.
In relation to certain multi-service customers, distributors are able to bring forward the payment of a limited number of future monthly commission payments expected to be due on the usage of customers they have introduced.
These advanced commission payments are held on the Balance Sheet as prepayments and are amortised on a straight-line basis through the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period during which they are earned and would otherwise have been paid had the payment not been brought forward.
f Financial income and expenses Financial income comprises interest income and is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method.
Financial expenses comprise bank interest and nonutilisation fees associates with the Companys debt facilities.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 97 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED g Leases Payments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
h Hire purchase agreements Hire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases.
When assets are leased out under finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
i Taxation The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided on other assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 50 years Freehold and leasehold improvements 3 to 25 years Plant and machinery 15 years Fixtures, fittings and office equipment - Fixtures and fittings 7 to 10 years - Computer and office equipment 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
k Investment properties Investment properties are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Rental income from investment properties is accounted for on an accruals basis.
98 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED l Intangible assets Intangible assets which arise e. g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements are capitalised and amortised over the shorter of their useful life and the term of any contractual arrangement or, where appropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment review.
IT, software and web development costs are capitalised as intangible assets to the extent that certain projects can be separately identified and involve the production of new and or enhanced systems that the Company will use over the medium term.
It must also be considered probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can be measured reliably.
Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised include employee and external costs specifically incurred in the development of the intangible asset.
These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to 5 years when each system is brought into use by the Company.
m Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the fair value of consideration and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
n Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
o Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated at cost.
Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments.
In the Group accounts investments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends received from the associated undertakings.
p Inventories Inventories principally include mobile telephones, LED light bulbs and other electronic equipment and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
q Financial instruments The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 99 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Financial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.
Financial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
r Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material.
s Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, short term revolving credit facilities.
t Borrowings Short and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans.
The fees associated with entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over the term of the borrowings.
u Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
v Share based payments The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
All share option based remuneration is equity settled.
w Segmental reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, Chief Executive Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
x Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
y Pensions The Group makes contributions to certain employees personal pension plans.
These are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.
z Dividends Final dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
100 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED aa New standards issued but not yet effective The Group has not yet applied the following standard as it is not yet effective in the consolidated Group financial statements and remains subject to endorsement by the EU: IFRS 16: Leases, effective for the year ending 31 March 2020.
The following standards are not yet effective in the consolidated Group financial statements but have been endorsed by the EU: IFRS 9: Financial instruments, effective for the year ended 31 March 2019: and IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers, effective for year ended 31 March 2019.
IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and subsequent amendments, Clarifications to IFRS 15, were issued in April 2016.
IFRS 15, as amended, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018: it has not yet been adopted by the EU.
The impact of IFRS 15 on the Groups reporting of revenue and costs is currently being assessed.
Initial work has indicated that the following areas, inter alia, may also be impacted by IFRS 15: Under IFRS 15, certain incremental costs incurred in acquiring a contract with a customer may be deferred on the balance sheet and amortised as revenue is recognised under the related contract: this could generally lead to the later recognition of charges for certain commissions payable to third party independent distributors.
Certain costs incurred in fulfilling customer contracts may be deferred on the balance sheet under IFRS 15 and recognised as related revenue is recognised under the contract.
Such deferred costs could be related to the provision of deliverables other than mobile handsets to customers that do not qualify as performance obligations and for which revenue is not recognised: currently such costs are generally expensed as incurred.
The Group is continuing to assess the impact of these and other accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 15: however, the changes highlighted above may have an impact on the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position after the Group adopts IFRS 15 on 1 April 2018.
When IFRS 15 is adopted, it can be applied either on a fully retrospective basis, requiring the restatement of the comparative periods presented in the financial statements, or with the cumulative retrospective impact of IFRS 15 applied as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption: when the latter approach is applied it is necessary to disclose the impact of IFRS 15 on each line item in the financial statements in the reporting period.
In respect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 16 exercises are underway to assess the impacts that these standards will have on the Groups assets and liabilities.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 101 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SEGMENT REPORTING The Groups reportable segments reflect the two distinct activities around which the Group is organised: Customer Acquisition: and Customer Management.
Customer Acquisition revenues mainly comprise sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets and wireless internet routers to customers.
Customer Management revenues are principally derived from the supply of fixed telephony, mobile telephony, gas, electricity, internet services and home insurance to residential and small business customers.
The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, which is referred to as operating profit.
The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across both operating segments.
It also includes a one-off recovery of 4.2m of costs incurred in prior years relating to the smart meter rollout programme under our energy supply agreement.

This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 31 March 2017 has been calculated based on these rates.
The gain on disposal of Opus is not taxable income for tax purposes as it is eligible for the substantial shareholding exemption.

Southon House is therefore now held as an investment property and separately disclosed on the balance sheet of the Company.
An independent valuation of Southon House was conducted at 30 September 2015 in accordance with RICS Valuation Professional Standards UK January 2014 revised April 2015 guidelines.
The independent market value of Southon House was determined to be 10.2 million and has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
The valuation was prepared on a Market Value basis as defined in the Valuation Standards and was primarily derived from using comparable market transactions carried out on an arms length basis.
These inputs are deemed unobservable.
The directors believe that there have not been any material changes in circumstances that would lead to a significant change in the market valuation of Southon House since 30 September 2015.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Energy Supply IT Software & Web Contract Development Total 000 000 000 Cost At 1 April 2016 224,563 - 224,563 Transfers from property, plant & equipment - 2,165 2,165 Additions - 3,406 3,406 At 31 March 2017 224,563 5,571 230,134 Amortisation At 1 April 2016 26,199 - 26,199 Transfers from property, plant & equipment - 1,272 1,272 Charge for the period 11,228 860 12,088 At 31 March 2017 37,427 2,132 39,559 Net book amount at 31 March 2017 187,136 3,439 190,575 Net book amount at 31 March 2016 198,364 - 198,364 The Energy Supply Contract intangible asset relates to the entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited the Companies from Npower Limited having effect from 1 December 2013 the Transaction.
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a payment to Npower of 196.5 million on 20 December 2013, a deferred amount of 21.5 million paid in December 2016 and a payment of 2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which comprised cash and short term working capital balances.
The addition to intangible assets of 221.6 million in 2014 therefore represented the total consideration paid and payable to Npower, excluding the payment for net assets acquired in the Companies, plus certain transaction costs of 3.6 million which in accordance with the relevant accounting standards were recognised as a cost of acquisition.
The intangible asset is being amortised evenly over the 20 year life of the new energy supply agreement reflecting the period over which the Company will benefit from the agreement.
The Board regularly monitors the carrying amount of the intangible assets.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2017 to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets was supported by their value in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on current levels of profitability.
A post-tax discount rate of 7.0% was used which was considered appropriate given the expectation that, for term of the contract, the Group will continue to derive significant value from supplying energy to its customers.
The result of the review undertaken at 31 March 2017 indicated that no impairment was necessary.
No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment of intangible assets.
The IT Software and Web Development intangible asset relates to the capitalisation of certain costs associated with the development of new IT and web systems.
Approximately 1.3 million of the additions during the year relate to IT systems which remain under construction.

The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2017 to assess whether the carrying amount of assets was supported by their value in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on current levels of profitability.
A post-tax discount rate of 10% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the relatively small size of the business and the expectation that, for the foreseeable future, TML will continue to operate as a going concern.
However, no growth has been assumed in the review given the relative maturity of the business.
No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment of goodwill.

INVESTMENTS Fixed asset investments The investment in the associate represented the cost of purchasing a 20% 2016: 20% equity interest in the ordinary share capital of Opus Energy Group Limited Opus, together with the Groups share of retained reserves.
The Companys 20% investment in Opus was sold on 10 February 2017 for 71,102,650.

CAPITAL AND RESERVES CONTINUED Capital management The Groups overall objective when managing capital is to continue to provide attractive returns to shareholders.
Total shareholder equity at 31 March 2017 was 257.7 million 2016: 198.3 million.
The Groups current capital management strategy is to retain sufficient working capital for day to day operating requirements.
In addition, as a result of the entering the energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013, and the consequent drawdown of transaction debt facilities, the Groups capital management strategy is also to ensure that interest costs are minimised.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of energy to the Companys customers.
This includes funding the Budget Plans of customers who pay for their energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.

This dividend will be subject to income tax at each recipients individual marginal income tax rate.

EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share EPS is based on the following data: 2017 2016 000 000 Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted EPS 94,960 31,774 Share of profit related to associate net of tax 64,517 5,609 Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted EPS - continuing operations 30,443 26,165 Share incentive scheme charges net of tax 968 2,278 Amortisation of energy supply contract intangible assets 11,228 11,228 Earnings excluding share incentive scheme charges and amortisation of 42,639 39,671 intangibles for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted EPS Number Number 000s 000s Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 80,073 79,789 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares share incentive awards 438 363 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 80,511 80,152 Continuing operations 1 Adjusted basic EPS 53.3p 49.7p Basic EPS 38.0p 32.8p Continuing operations 1 Adjusted diluted EPS 53.0p 49.5p Diluted EPS 37.8p 32.6p 1 Adjusted basic and diluted EPS for continuing operations exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of the intangible asset recognised as a result of the new energy supply arrangements entered into with Npower in December 2013.
It has been deemed appropriate to present the analysis of adjusted EPS excluding share incentive scheme charges due to the relative size and historical volatility of the charges.
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item the amortisation of intangible assets arising from the energy supply agreement with Npower has also been adjusted.

COMMITMENTS Operating lease commitments The Group is committed to make payments in respect of operating leases for land and buildings as follows: Company and Group 2017 2016 000 000 Amounts payable: Less than one year 103 117 Between one and five years 68 193 171 310 The principal lease arrangements relate to office premises.
Capital commitments At 31 March 2017 the Company had capital commitments of approximately 76,000 2016: 285,000.
Energy supply arrangements The Group entered into a 20 year energy supply agreement with Npower the SSA on 20 December 2013.
In the event that the SSA is terminated by Npower in certain circumstances, including on a material breach by the Group or on the insolvency of the Company, additional consideration of up to 187 million may become payable by the Company to Npower.
Full details of the termination provisions of the SSA were set out in paragraph 4 of Part VIII on page 38 of the prospectus issued to shareholders on 20 November 2013.
However, given the energy supply agreement termination rights are either, in the directors view, very unlikely to occur or entirely within the control of the Group, the directors believe the likelihood of this type of termination event is remote.
The amount of the additional consideration reduces from 187 million to 11 million over the remaining life of the supply agreement.
Furthermore, depending on the circumstances giving rise to a termination event, the additional consideration if payable may be spread over the unexpired term of the supply agreement.
Following any such termination event, the Group would have direct access to the wholesale energy markets and the opportunity to earn additional margin from sourcing energy directly for the Groups customer base.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has two share option plans, one of which is available to employees, the other to distributors of the Company.
The Company has also established a Save As You Earn share option plan the 2015 Employee SAYE Share Option Plan for employees.
All new employees who have passed the requisite probationary period are issued with market price options over shares in the Company, further options are also granted to existing employees depending on their seniority and length of service The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Employee Share Option Plan.
The 2015 Employee SAYE Share Option Plan enables employees of the group to acquire shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner using monies saved from salary over a three or five year period.
A summary of the principal terms of the SAYE Share Option Plan were set out in the Appendix to the 2015 AGM circular sent to all shareholders.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED The distributor scheme The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives to the people who are most successful in gathering new customers for the Company.
As it is not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit received has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
A reconciliation of movements in the numbers of share options for the Group can be summarised as follows: 2017 2016 Number Weighted Number Weighted average average exercise price exercise price At 1 April 2,489,194 916p 2,269,104 991p Options granted 583,236 1,101p 1,176,001 999p Options exercised 181,645 574p 103,813 556p Options lapsed expired 227,668 1,085p 852,098 1,273p At 31 March 2,663,117 965p 2,489,194 916p The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised during the year was 1,154.3p 2016: 1,063.3p.
During the current year ended 31 March 2017 and prior year ended 31 March 2016, the Group issued share options to employees and distributors on the occasions set out below.
The expected volatility for the share option arrangements is based on historical volatility determined by the analysis of daily share price movements over the previous 12 months.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board.
They are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments All financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of 155,336,000 2016: 169,444,000 and for the Company of 43,637,000 2016: 65,201,000.
All financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of 135,421,000 2016: 227,857,000 and for the Company 51,099,000 2016: 140,930,000. Credit risk All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit: accordingly credit risk in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of whom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue.
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers.
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new customer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone who submits a properly completed application form.
Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for the energy they have used delinquent customers, there is likely to be a delay before the Company is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable.
The Group has identified specific balances for which it has provided an impairment allowance on a line by line basis across all ledgers, in both years.
No general impairment allowance has been provided in either year.
The allowance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the financial asset directly.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns.
The Groups profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK base rate of - 1% from current levels.
Commodity price risk The Group is not materially exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the agreements with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of any such fluctuations through to its customers.
124 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity risk The Groups treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding.
Foreign currency risk The Group does not have any significant foreign currency exposure.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
Receivables due after one year include 3,683,000 2016: 3,940,000 due mainly from distributors elements of which earn interest at varying rates above Base Rate.
Borrowing facilities At 31 March 2017, the Group had total revolving credit facilities of 150,000,000 2016: 150,000,000.
These facilities are available to the Group until 14 December 2020.
As at 31 March 2017 Nil of the facilities was drawn down 2016: 71,241,000 drawn down.
As at 31 March 2017 the Company also had letters of credit in place relating to certain energy distribution charges with a total value covered of 15,585,500 2016: 12,340,500.
The facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the Company and through a cross guarantee with the Companys subsidiaries Electricity Plus Supply Limited, Gas Plus Supply Limited, Utilities Plus Limited and Telecommunications Management Limited.
Further details of the facilities are set out in note 12 of these financial statements.
Fair values There is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments and their net book amount due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
