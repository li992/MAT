Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy used to analyse the fair values of financial assets is described below.
The levels are determined by the lowest that is the least reliable or least independently observable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows: Level 1 using unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market: Level 2 using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable based on market data : and Level 3 using inputs that are unobservable for which market data is unavailable.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on page 46.

19 Financial Instruments As an Investment Trust, the Company invests in listed and unlisted equities and makes other investments so as to achieve its investment objective of maximising total return, whilst also generating dividend growth, from a focused and actively managed global portfolio.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
Risk provides the potential for both losses and gains and in assessing risk, the Board encourages the Managers to exploit the opportunities that risk affords.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Managers both assess the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitor the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9 and on pages 21 to 23.
56 Annual Report 2017 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and report to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Managers assess the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the country in which a company is listed is not necessarily where it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings can limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC 57 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk Sensitivity At 31 March 2017, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the Financial Statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2016.
2017 2016 000 000 US dollar 150,919 102,621 Euro 52,800 36,922 Hong Kong dollar 15,437 9,548 Swedish krona 12,442 7,826 Indian rupee 3,927 2,106 Danish krone 2,355 2,705 Brazilian real 1,391 883 Polish zloty 264 Japanese yen 395 Indonesian rupiah 883 647 240,154 163,917 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate movements may affect directly: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate borrowings: and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments outwith fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the market value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value at fair value.
58 Annual Report 2017 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk continued The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 31 March is shown below: Financial Assets 2017 2017 2016 2016 2017 Weighted Weighted 2016 Weighted Weighted Fair value average average period Fair value average average period 000 interest rate until maturity 000 interest rate until maturity Floating rate: Brazilian bonds index linked 27,277 9.7% 28 years 17,241 11.0% 29 years Cash and short term deposits: Other overseas currencies 67,547 n a 11,196 n a Sterling 9,096 0.1% n a 32,777 0.3% n a Based on expected maturity date.
The cash deposits generally comprise call or short term money market deposits of less than one month which are repayable on demand.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the Interbank market rates.
Financial Liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Companys bank loans and debentures at amortised cost and the maturity profile of the undiscounted future cash flows in respect of the Companys contractual financial liabilities at 31 March are shown below.
Interest Rate Risk Profile The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: 2017 2016 000 000 Floating rate US$ denominated 291,883 114,799 Fixed rate Sterling denominated 149,710 150,079 US$ denominated 67,973 233,076 509,566 497,954 Maturity Profile The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 Within Between 1 More than Within Between 1 More than 1 year and 5 years 5 years 1 year and 5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Repayment of loans and debentures 359,856 20,000 125,675 288,736 79,139 125,675 Accumulated interest on loans and debentures to maturity date 18,060 52,487 33,022 18,094 55,125 44,209 377,916 72,487 158,697 306,830 134,264 169,884 Includes 675,000 irredeemable debenture stock.
Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 March 2017 would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 3,729,000 2016 2,177,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 0.55p 2016 increased by 0.84p.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC 59 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objectives and investment policies.
The portfolio does not seek to reproduce the index, investments are selected based upon the merit of individual companies and therefore performance may well diverge from the short term fluctuations of the benchmark.
The Board provides guidance to the Managers on the level of unlisted investments.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity Fixed asset investments are valued at bid prices which equate to their fair value.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 21 to 23.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest investments by their aggregate market value are contained in the Strategic Report.
93.8% 2016 99.5% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
A 3% increase in quoted companies equity valuations at 31 March 2017 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 137,125,000 2016 103,177,000.
A decrease of 3% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is potentially significant but the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are believed to be readily realisable.
The Board provides guidance to the Investment Managers as to the maximum exposure to any one holding and to the maximum aggregate exposure to substantial holdings.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Managers make an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: the Board regularly receives information from the Investment Managers on the credit ratings of those bonds and other securities in which the Company has invested: the Depositary is liable for the loss of financial instruments held in custody.
The Depositary will ensure that any delegate segregates the assets of the Company.
The Depositary has delegated the custody function to Bank of New York Mellon SA NV London Branch.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Managers.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations at the same time as any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: transactions involving derivatives, and other arrangements wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Managers of the creditworthiness of that counterparty.
The Companys aggregate exposure to each such counterparty is monitored regularly by the Board: and cash is held only at banks that are regularly reviewed by the Managers.
Credit Risk Exposure The maximum exposure to direct credit risk at 31 March was: 2017 2016 000 000 Fixed interest investments 27,277 17,241 Cash and short term deposits 76,643 43,973 Debtors and prepayments 16,293 4,051 120,213 65,265 None of the Companys financial assets is past due or impaired.
60 Annual Report 2017 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Directors are of the opinion that the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are stated at fair value in the Balance Sheet with the exception of long term borrowing.
Long term borrowings in relation to debentures are included in the accounts at the amortised amount of net proceeds after issue, plus accrued finance costs in accordance with FRS 102.
The fair value of bank loans is calculated with reference to government bonds of comparable maturity and yield.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing the net asset value per share from 358.7p to 354.6p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2017 of 366.1p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 3.2% as against a premium of 2.1% on a debt at book basis.
At 31 March 2016 the effect would have been to reduce the net asset value from 263.4p to 259.2p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2016 of 262.5p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 1.3% as against a discount of 0.3% on a debt at book basis.
Deducting long term borrowings at par value would have the effect of increasing the net asset value per share from 358.7p to 359.0p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2017 of 366.1p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 2.0% as against a premium of 2.1% on a debt at book basis.
At 31 March 2016 the effect would have been to increase the net asset value from 263.4p to 263.8p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2016 of 262.5p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 0.5% as against a discount of 0.3% on a debt at book basis.
Capital Management The capital of the Company is its share capital and reserves as set out in notes 13 and 14 together with its borrowings see notes 11 and 12.
