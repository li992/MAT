142 Sky plc Financial statements The financial performance of the Group is presented using a variety of alternative performance measures.
These measures are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similarly titled alternative performance measures used elsewhere.
These measures should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, IFRS measures.
Adjusted results In order to provide a measure of underlying performance, management has chosen to present adjusted results for the year which exclude items that may distort comparability.
Such items arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but which management believes should be separately identified to help explain underlying performance.
A reconciliation of adjusted results to the closest equivalent statutory measure is provided in the tables above for the current and prior years.
Like-for-like Like-for-like revenue excludes the impact of the 53rd week in the prior year and is on an adjusted, constant currency basis.
Like-for-like revenue growth at actual exchange rates is 10% 12,916 million versus 11,965 million less 174 million.
Constant currency Some of the Groups IFRS and adjusted measures are translated at constant currency exchange rates.
Constant currency exchange rates are the average actual exchange rates of the current financial year and are used to eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations in assessing performance.
Actual exchange rates are the average actual periodic rates for that financial year.
The constant currency exchange rate used for the current year is 1.16:1.
A reconciliation of the adjusted measures at constant currency to the adjusted measures at actual exchange rates is provided below.
