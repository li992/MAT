Impairments During 2017 the software impairment charge was 20m 2016: 1m, none of which was charged to underwriting and policy acquisition costs 2016: nil.
The impairment relates to software in the UK where business volumes have been lower than anticipated 11m and a Scandinavian IT system where certain older elements have been rendered obsolete 9m.
When testing for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of the Cash Generating Unit CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is compared to the recoverable amount as determined by a value in use calculation.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on operating plans approved by management covering a three year period and using the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses and taxes using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information as discussed in more detail in the strategic report section.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which management deem appropriate for the CGU.
The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by appropriate discount rates.
Where a sales price has been agreed for a CGU, the sales proceeds less costs to sell are considered the best estimate of the value in use.
Where the value in use is less than the current carrying value of the CGU in the statement of financial position, the goodwill is impaired in order to ensure that the CGU carrying value is not greater than its future value to the Group.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs, which are contained within the following operating segments: 2017 2016 m m Scandinavia Sweden, Norway, Denmark 155 152 Canada Commercial, Johnson, Personal, Travel 157 160 UK and International Ireland, Oman 50 33 Total Goodwill 362 345 In 2016, legislation was issued by the Oman Government requiring a proportion of the company to be offered to the public.
This was expected to result in the Group losing control and therefore the Oman business was classified as held for sale.
Consequently the business was measured at fair value less costs to sell resulting in a valuation adjustment in 2016 of 30m.
The proportion of business sold in 2017 was lower than expected resulting in control being retained by the Group.
Goodwill of 17m has been reinstated in 2017 as a consequence.
Impairment sensitivity Following completion of the Group impairment testing, it was identified that the Norway CGU was sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
The sensitivities are listed below: Norway Potential Impairment m Change to each year of the planning period 2018 to 2020 6% decrease in earned premium 3 6% increase in COR 3 The range of pre-tax discount rates used for goodwill impairment testing, which reflect specific risks relating to the CGU at the date of evaluation and weighted average growth rates used in 2017 for the CGUs within each operating segment are shown below.
The growth rates include improvements in trade performance, where these are forecast in the three year operational plan for the CGU.

Group occupied property was revalued on 31 December 2017 by independent valuers using the basis of valuation as set out in note 26.
Depreciation expenses of 20m 2016: 20m have been charged to underwriting costs and policy acquisition costs.
The carrying amount of group occupied property that would have been recognised had the assets been carried under the cost model including assets held for sale at 31 December 2017 is 26m 2016: 30m.

In such circumstances the Group may apply hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS and the Group accounting policy on hedging.
The Group applies hedge accounting to derivatives acquired to reduce foreign exchange risk in its net investment in certain major overseas subsidiaries.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in respect of these hedges during 2017 or 2016.
The Group also applies hedge accounting to specified fixed interest assets in its investment portfolio.
In order to remove exchange risk from these assets the Group may also acquire cross currency interest rate swaps to swap the cash flows from the portfolio into cash flows denominated in pounds sterling or the functional currency of the entity acquiring the asset.
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting when using fixed to floating interest rate swaps and cash flow hedge accounting when using fixed to fixed interest rate swaps.
The interest rate swaps exactly offset the timing and amounts expected to be received on the underlying investments.
The investments have a remaining term of between four months and 38 years, with the substantial majority having a term of less than eight years.
There have been no default and no defaults are expected on the hedged investments.
The total gains on cash flow hedge instruments during 2017 were 3m 2016: 6m gain in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, and the amount reclassified to the income statement was 1m 2016: 1m.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement was nil 2016: nil.
The total losses on the fair value hedge instruments recognised in the income statement were 45m 2016: 50m and the offsetting gains related to the hedged risk were 50m 2016: 45m.
The Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting arrangements.
In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one counterparty to the other.
In certain circumstances, such as a credit default, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position.
This is because the Group does not have any current legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events.
The tables below provide information on the impact of the netting arrangements.
In addition, during 2017, the Group took out borrowings from credit institutions under repurchase agreements of 119m 2016: 249m note 36.
The Group continues to recognise debt securities in the statement of financial position as the Group remains exposed to the risks and rewards of ownership.

Cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables, other assets and other liabilities For cash, loans and receivables, commercial paper, other assets, liabilities and accruals, their carrying amounts are considered to be as approximate fair values.
Group occupied property and investment property Group occupied properties are valued on a vacant possession basis using third party valuers.
Investment properties are valued, at least annually, at their highest and best use.
The fair value of property has been determined by external, independent valuers, having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.
The valuations of buildings with vacant possession are based on the comparative method of valuation with reference to sales of other vacant buildings.
Fair value is then determined based on the locational qualities and physical building characteristics principally condition, size, specification and layout as appropriate.
Investment properties are valued using discounted cash flow models which take into account the net present value of cash flows to be generated from the properties.
The cash flow streams reflect the current rent the gross rent payable to lease expiry, at which point it is assumed that each unit will be re-let at its estimated rental value.
Allowances have been made for voids and rent free periods where applicable.
The appropriate rent to be capitalised is selected on the basis of the location of the building, its quality, tenant credit quality and lease terms amongst other factors.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 147 Notes to the Statement of Financial Position continued These cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate of interest to determine their present value.
In both cases the estimated fair value would increase decrease if: The estimated rental value is higher lower : Void periods were shorter longer : The occupancy rates were higher lower : Rent free periods were shorter longer : The discount rates were lower higher.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are financial contracts whose fair value is determined on a market basis by reference to underlying interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity or commodity instrument or indices.
Loan capital The fair value measurement of the Groups loan capital instruments, with the exception of the subordinated guaranteed US$ bonds, are based on pricing obtained from a range of financial intermediaries who base their valuations on recent transactions of the Groups loan capital instruments and other observable market inputs such as applicable risk free rate and appropriate credit risk spreads.
The fair value measurement of the subordinated guaranteed US$ bonds is also obtained from an indicative valuation based on the applicable risk free rate and appropriate credit risk spread.
Fair value hierarchy Fair value for all assets and liabilities which are either measured or disclosed is determined based on available information and categorised according to a three-level fair value hierarchy as detailed below: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from data other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset or liability valuation that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market level 1 if quoted prices for that financial instrument are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The Group uses prices received from external providers who calculate these prices from quotes available at the reporting date for the particular investment being valued.
For investments that are actively traded the Group determines whether the prices meet the criteria for classification as a level 1 valuation.
The price provided is classified as a level 1 valuation when it represents the price at which the investment traded at the reporting date taking into account the frequency and volume of trading of the individual investment together with the spread of prices that are quoted at the reporting date for such trades.
Typically investments in frequently traded government debt would meet the criteria for classification in the level 1 category.
Where the prices provided do not meet the criteria for classification in the level 1 category, the prices are classified in the level 2 category.
In limited circumstances, the Group does not receive pricing information from an external provider for its financial investments.
In such circumstances the Group calculates fair value which may use input parameters that are not based on observable market data.
Unobservable inputs are based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions for the same instrument nor based on available market data.
In these cases, judgment is required to establish fair values.
Valuations that require the significant use of unobservable data are classified as level 3 valuations.
In addition, the valuations used for investment properties and for Group occupied properties are classified in the level 3 category.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments and other items that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value as well as financial liabilities not measured at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3.
The table does not include financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The Groups property portfolio including the Group occupied properties is almost exclusively located in the UK.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations have been determined using an increase of 100bps in the discount rate used in the valuation.
The Groups investments in financial assets classified at level 3 in the hierarchy are primarily investments in various private fund structures investing in debt instruments where the valuation includes estimates of the credit spreads on the underlying holdings.
The estimates of the credit spread are based upon market observable credit spreads for what are considered to be assets with similar credit risk.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations have been determined using an increase of 100bps in the credit spread used in the valuation.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 151 Notes to the Statement of Financial Position continued 27 Interests in structured entities A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Group does not securitise any of its investments in financial instruments and does not create, promote or administer structured entities on behalf of third party investors.
The Group therefore considers that it does not act as a sponsor for any structured entity.
However, the Group invests in unleveraged entities created by and managed by external specialist investment managers where investments are pooled within an investment vehicle to provide a diversified exposure to particular classes of underlying investments.
The use of these products allows the Group to broaden the diversification of its investment portfolio in a cost-efficient manner.
The Group normally limits its exposures in individual structured entities to less than 20% of the total capital of the entity.
The Group is exposed to the risks of the underlying investments of the investment vehicles.
The investment return from the structured entities is expected to reflect the returns from the underlying investments of the entity.
In addition, the Group has commitments for future undrawn subscriptions limited to the amounts set out in the subscription agreements.
The Group has no obligations to provide any other additional funding or other financial support to these entities.
The Group has determined that its maximum exposure to structured entities is the sum of the carrying value and the undrawn commitments.

This includes capital losses of 1,189m 2016: 1,194m for which it is unlikely that a deferred tax asset would be recognised as most UK capital gains are exempt from tax.
None of these losses are subject to expiry.
In addition, the Group has deductible temporary differences of 198m 2016: 654m for which no deferred tax has been recognised.
The Group has temporary differences in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries not held for sale of 509m 2016: 1,006m on which overseas taxes, including withholding taxes, might be incurred on the remittance of these earnings to the UK.
This amount relates to the Groups subsidiaries in Canada.
The Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit the retained earnings in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger a material incremental tax liability.
As such the Group has not recognised any deferred tax in respect of the potential taxes on the temporary differences arising on unremitted earnings of continuing overseas subsidiaries and associates.
Of the 220m 2016: 216m net deferred tax asset recognised by the Groups continuing operations, 233m 2016: 179m relate to tax jurisdictions in which the Group has suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period.
The assets have been recognised on the basis that future taxable profits will be available against which these deferred tax assets can be utilised.
The evidence for the future taxable profits is a forecast consistent with the three year operational plans prepared by the relevant businesses, which are subject to internal review and challenge.
Where relevant, the forecast includes extrapolations of the operational plans using assumptions consistent with those used in the plans.

33 Other equity instruments Tier 1 Notes On 27 March 2017, the Company issued two floating rate Restricted Tier 1 RT1 Notes totalling 297m in aggregate size and with a blended coupon of c. 4.7%.
The Notes are as follows: Swedish Krona 2,500m at 3 month Stibor 525bps equivalent to c. 4.8% coupon on issue Danish Krone 650m at 3 month Cibor 485bps equivalent to c. 4.6% coupon on issue Interest on the Notes is due and payable only at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, subject to certain additional restrictions set out in the terms and conditions, and is non-cumulative.
In addition the terms and conditions of the Notes will require the Company to cancel interest payments in certain circumstances.
The Notes are redeemable subject to certain conditions at the option of the Company in whole but not in part on the first call date, being the fifth anniversary of the issue date, or any interest payment date thereafter or in the event of certain changes in the tax, regulatory or ratings treatment of the Notes.
Any redemption is subject, inter alia, to the Company giving notice to the relevant regulator and the regulator granting permission to redeem.
The Notes convert into ordinary shares of the Company, at a pre-determined price in the event that certain solvency capital requirements are breached, as more fully set out in the terms and conditions of the Notes.
Accordingly, the Notes are treated as a separate category within Equity and coupon payments are recognised as distributions, similar to the treatment of preference share dividends.

RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 157 Notes to the Statement of Financial Position continued 37 Insurance contract liabilities Estimation techniques and uncertainties Provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to a robust reserving process by each of the Groups business units and at Group Corporate Centre, as detailed in the Risk Management note.
There is also considerable uncertainty in regard to the eventual outcome of the claims that have occurred by the end of the reporting period but remain unsettled.
This includes claims that may have occurred but have not yet been notified to the Group and those that are not yet apparent to the insured.
The provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using previous claims experience with similar cases, historical payment trends, the volume and nature of the insurance underwritten by the Group and current specific case reserves.
Also considered are developing loss payment trends, the potential longer term significance of large events, and the levels of unpaid claims, legislative changes, judicial decisions and economic, political and regulatory conditions.
The Group uses a number of commonly accepted actuarial projection methodologies to determine the appropriate provision to recognise.
These include methods based upon the following: The development of previously settled claims, where payments to date are extrapolated for each prior year: Estimates based upon a projection of claims numbers and average cost: Notified claims development, where notified claims to date for each year are extrapolated based upon observed development of earlier years: Expected loss ratios: BornhuetterFerguson method, which combines features of the above methods: Bespoke methods for specialist classes of business.
In selecting the method and estimate appropriate to any one class of insurance business, the Group considers the appropriateness of the methods and bases to the individual circumstances of the provision class and underwriting year.
Individually large and significant claims are generally assessed separately, being measured either at the face value of the loss adjusters estimates or projected separately in order to allow for the future development of large claims.
The level of provision carried by the Group targets the inclusion of a margin of 5% for the core businesses on top of the actuarial indication outlined above.
The appropriateness of the 5% target is subject to regular review as part of the Group reserving process at Group Corporate Centre.
Discount assumptions The total value of provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses less related reinsurance recoveries before discounting for continuing operations is 8,520m 2016: 8,784m.
Claims on certain classes of business excluding annuities have been discounted as follows: Average number of years to Discount rate settlement from reporting date 2017 2016 2017 2016 Category % % Years Years UK Asbestos and environmental 4.0 4.0 8 11 Scandinavia Disability 1.3 1.3 8 7 In determining the average number of years to ultimate claims settlement, estimates have been made based on the underlying claims settlement patterns.
As at 31 December 2017, the value of the discount on net claims liability reserves is 111m 2016: 388m excluding held for sale, annuities and periodic payment orders.
All other factors remaining constant, a decrease of 1% in the discount rates would reduce the value of the discount by approximately 70m 2016: 120m.
A decrease of 1% in the real discount rate for UK and Scandinavia annuities would reduce the value of the discount by approximately 100m 2016: 110m.
The sensitivity calculation has taken into consideration the undiscounted provisions for each class of business and the respective average settlement period.

The estimated provisions for ultimate incurred losses change as more information becomes known about the actual losses for which the initial provisions were set up and as the rates of exchange change.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi-employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 8m 2016: 8m were paid to this scheme during 2017 and are included in the costs shown above.
The expected contributions in 2018 are 7m.
Total estimated contributions to the scheme from all employers in 2017 were 66m.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2017, when the scheme funding rate was 121% 2016: 111%.
Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits The amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position are as follows: 2017 2016 UK Other Total UK Other Total m m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 8,326 434 8,760 8,314 460 8,774 Present value of unfunded obligations 7 111 118 7 112 119 Fair value of plan assets 8,344 455 8,799 8,184 457 8,641 Other net surplus remeasurements 62 62 Net IAS19 deficits in the schemes 51 90 141 137 115 252 Defined benefit pension schemes 51 30 81 137 59 196 Other post-retirement benefits 60 60 56 56 Schemes in surplus note 30 119 22 141 58 12 70 Schemes in deficit note 39 170 112 282 195 127 322 Independent actuaries calculate the value of the defined benefit obligations for the larger schemes by applying the projected unit credit method.
The future expected cash outflows calculated based on assumptions that include inflation and mortality are discounted to present value, using a discount rate determined at the end of each reporting period by reference to current market yields on high quality corporate bonds AA rated identified to match the currency and term structure of the obligations.
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, future inflation, the employees age upon termination and retirement, mortality rates, future pension increases, disability incidence and health and dental care cost trends.
If actual experience differs from the assumptions used, the expected obligation could increase or decrease in future years.
Due to the complexity of the valuation and its long-term nature, the defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions.
Assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
As such, the valuation of the liability is highly sensitive to changes in bond rates and will also be impacted by changes in equity markets.
UK Schemes The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are mainly held in separate trustee administered funds.
The UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants in 2002 and subsequently closed to future accruals with effect from 31 March 2017.
UK schemes in surplus have been reduced for the tax cost of an authorised return of surplus, classified as Other net surplus remeasurements.
Our judgement is that the authorised refund tax charge is not an income tax within the meaning of IAS12 and so the surplus is recognised net of this tax charge rather than the tax charge being included within deferred taxation.
The profile of the members of the two main UK schemes at 30 September 2017 the latest date at which full information is available is as follows: Number Active members members in employment with the Group and accruing benefits Deferred members members no longer accruing and not yet receiving benefits 26,119 Pensioners members and dependants receiving benefits 17,938 Total members at 30 September 2017 44,057 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 163 Notes to the Statement of Financial Position continued Accrued benefits are revalued up to retirement in accordance with Government indices for inflation.
A cap of 2.5% per annum applies to the revaluation of benefits accrued post March 2010 a cap of 5% per annum applies for benefits which accrued prior to this date.
After retirement, pensions in payment are increased each year based on the increases in the Government indices for inflation.
A cap of 2.5% applies to benefits accrued post 31 December 2005 a cap of 5% applied to benefits in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension prior to this date.
The UK schemes are managed through trusts with independent trustees responsible for the safeguard of the interests of all members.
The trustees meet regularly with Group management to discuss the funding position and any proposed changes to the schemes.
The schemes are regulated by The Pensions Regulator.
The Group is exposed to risks through its obligation to fund the schemes.
These risks include market risk assets not performing as well as expected, inflation risk and mortality risk over the lives of the members.
The Group and the trustees of the schemes work together to reduce these risks through agreement of investment policy including the use of interest rate, inflation rate and mortality swaps.
During 2009 the Group entered into arrangements that provide coverage against mortality risk for 55% of the retirement obligations relating to pensions in payment of the two largest UK schemes at that time c. 40% coverage based on current pensioner population.
The arrangement provides for reimbursement of the covered pension obligations in return for the contractual return receivable on portfolios of assets including some interest rate swaps held by the pension funds at the inception of the arrangement.
The arrangement is accounted for as a longevity swap.
The longevity swap is measured at fair value under IFRS 13 by discounting all future cash flows using a discount rate that appropriately reflects the terms of the arrangements.
The pension schemes continue to hold the original assets used to fund the arrangements.
Each scheme is subject to triennial valuations, which are used to determine the future funding of the schemes by the Group including funding to repair any funding deficit.
The funding valuations, which determine the level of cash contributions payable into the schemes and which must be agreed between the Trustees and the Group, are typically based on a prudent assessment of future experience with the discount rate reflecting a prudent expectation of returns based on actual investment strategy.
This differs from IAS 19, which requires that future benefit cash flows are projected on the basis of best-estimate assumptions and discounted in line with high-quality corporate bond yields.
The Trustees funding assumptions are updated only every three years, following completion of the triennial funding valuations.
The effective date of the most recent valuations of the main UK funds is 31 March 2015.
At the most recent funding valuations, the main UK funds had an aggregate funding deficit of 392m, equivalent to a funding level of 95%.
The Group and the Trustees agreed funding plans at that time to eliminate the funding deficits by 2025.
Details of the deficit contributions paid in 2016 and 2017 and that are due to be paid in 2018 under these plans are disclosed below.
The funding plans will be reviewed again following the next triennial funding valuations which will have an effective date of 31 March 2018.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2017 was 82m 2016: 96m of which 65m 2016: 66m were additional contributions in line with the plan to reduce funding deficits.
Expected contributions to the two schemes for the year ending 31 December 2018 are approximately 73m including 65m of additional contributions to reduce the deficit.
164 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 m Financial statements Non UK schemes The Group also operates defined benefits schemes in other countries.
The most significant of these schemes are in Canada and Ireland.
The Group also provides post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances and benefits are generally payable for life.
The split of post-retirement liabilities across other countries is shown below: Non-UK liability split by country a. Canada 85% b. Ireland 14% c c. Scandinavia 1% b a All schemes The estimated discounted present values of the accumulated obligations are calculated in accordance with the advice of independent, qualified actuaries.

For the UK the annual rate of increase in pensions shown is the rate that applies to pensions that increase at RPI subject to a cap of 5%.
For other schemes the weighted average assumption is shown.
Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
At the funding valuation in March 2015, the mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the S2 base tables with percentage adjustments to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for by using the CMI 2016 tables with a long term rate of 1.25%.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 27.8 2016: 28.1 years for males and 28.9 2016: 29.2 years for females and a future pensioner aged 60 in 15 years time has a future expected lifetime from age 60 of 28.9 2016: 29.3 years for males and 30.1 2016: 30.7 years for females.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 167 Notes to the Statement of Financial Position continued Sensitivity analysis Sensitivities for the defined benefit obligations of the two main UK schemes are shown below: 3 2017 2016 Changes in assumption m m Discount rate Increase by 0.25% 363 373 1 RPI CPI Increase by 0.25% 228 235 Mortality long term rate Increase by 0.25% 78 126 2 Mortality assumption Reduce by 12% 319 330 Notes: 1.
The impact shown is for the appropriate increase in the revaluation of deferred pensions and the increases to pensions in payment resulting from the specified increase in RPI and CPI.
Reducing the mortality assumption by 12% is the equivalent of increasing the life expectancy of a male aged 60 years by 1 year.
2016 comparatives have been re-presented gross of tax.

The Group has no significant lease agreements that include contingent rent.
Operating lease commitments where the Group is the lessee The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Land and buildings Other 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m One year or less 50 44 1 1 Between one and five years 146 138 2 2 After five years 145 144 341 326 3 3 Recoveries under sub tenancies 17 5 Total 324 321 3 3 Operating lease commitments where the Group is the lessor The future aggregate minimum lease receipts under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Land and buildings 2017 2016 m m One year or less 19 22 Between one and five years 69 74 After five years 52 62 Total 140 158 43 Other commitments Capital Commitments The Groups significant capital commitments in respect of property and equipment and intangible assets are detailed in the table below: 2017 2016 m m Property and equipment 51 30 Intangible assets 143 98 Total 194 128 Funding commitments to structured entities and invested assets The future commitments to structured entities are disclosed in note 27 of these financial statements.
In addition, the Group has committed to invest 22m 2016: 24m in other classes of investments.
44 Other contingent liabilities In Canada the Group has purchased annuities from regulated Canadian life insurers in order to pay fixed and recurring payments to certain claimants.
This arrangement exposes the Group to a credit risk that the life insurers are unable to make these payments which is mitigated by an industry compensation scheme which in that event would assume a significant majority of the remaining outstanding obligations.
The likelihood of both a Canadian regulated life insurer and the industry compensation scheme being unable to pay their obligations is considered very remote and so no provision has been recognised in respect of this risk.
The Group receives liability claims and may also become involved in actual or threatened litigation, during the ordinary course of its business operations.
The Group reviews and, in the opinion of the directors, maintains sufficient provisions, capital and reserves in respect of such claims.
In addition, the Group has given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in relation to the disposals of its businesses and business interests to external parties.
These are kept under review and, in the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
170 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Appendices Appendix A: Other accounting policies Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls a subsidiary if the Group has all of the following: power over the subsidiary: exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary: and the ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect its returns.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is entitled by the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010 the cost of acquisition include the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration at the acquisition date and subsequent changes in the carrying value of the consideration are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For business combinations completed prior to 31 December 2009, the cost also includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition and the value of contingent consideration on settlement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Changes in the ownership interests of a subsidiary between shareholders of the Group and shareholders holding a non-controlling interest are accounted for as transactions between equity holders of the Group.
Any difference between the fair value of the consideration given by the transferee and the carrying value of the ownership interest transferred is recognised directly in equity.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Investment in associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups shares of its associates profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement and its share of comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The cumulative post acquisition movements are adjusted in the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Adjustments are made on consolidation, where necessary, to the accounting policies of associates to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Translation of foreign operations The results and financial position of subsidiaries and associates whose functional currency is not Sterling are translated into Sterling as follows: Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at closing exchange rates at the end of the period Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates during each period All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income within the foreign currency translation reserve.
Further information can be found in note 21.
When a foreign entity is sold, the cumulative exchange differences relating to that foreign entity are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 171 Appendices continued Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the Groups business operations using the exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Internal loans Where non-sterling loans are provided by RSA Insurance Group plc to its subsidiaries, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, they are treated as part of its net investment in subsidiary which results in foreign exchange gains and losses being recognised in revaluation reserves.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by various share trusts of the Group and held as own shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by increasing the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, notably those related to the employee share schemes.
Hedge Accounting Transactions are classified as hedging transactions when the following conditions for hedge accounting are met: There is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge The hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the originally documented risk management strategy for that particular hedging relationship The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured The hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined to have been highly effective Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation Where a foreign exchange derivative is designated as a hedging instrument against a net investment in foreign operations, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
At the point at which the net investment in the foreign operation is derecognised, the gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
On designation of forward foreign exchange contracts the interest element is separated from the forward exchange rate and is excluded from the hedge relationship.
Effectiveness of the hedge is then measured using the spot rate, which is also the exchange rate used when measuring the net investment in the designated subsidiaries.
For foreign exchange options the hedge designation is to hedge the value of the foreign operations at the strike price at the exercise date of the option.
Hedge of future cash flows Where a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument against the cash flows from a fixed interest security, the gains and losses arising from the change in fair value of the derivative are recognised initially in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve.
This amount is adjusted to be the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative and the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future cash flows of the security, both since the inception of the hedge.
The accumulated amount in the cash flow hedge reserve, is reclassified to the consolidated income statement in the period in which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.
Hedge of changes in fair value Where a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument in a fair value hedge of the changes in value of a fixed interest security, the gains and losses arising from the change in fair value of the derivative are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The change in fair value of the hedged investments that are attributable to the hedged risk is transferred from the revaluation reserve to the consolidated income statement.
172 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is comprised of Group occupied land and buildings and other equipment comprising of fixtures, fittings and other equipment including computer hardware and motor vehicles and is initially recognised at cost.
Group occupied property is stated at fair value, less subsequent depreciation for buildings.
The fair value methodology is set out in note 26.
Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation are recognised in other comprehensive income and credited to a separate revaluation reserve within equity.
Decreases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation are recognised in other comprehensive income and reduce the revaluation reserve, to the extent they offset previous revaluation increases: further decreases are charged to the consolidated income statement.
Buildings are depreciated to their residual value on a straight line basis over the useful economic life of the building: depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement except where a building has been revalued upwards, in which case the amount of the depreciation relating to the difference between the buildings revalued amount and the original cost is transferred from revaluation reserve to retained earnings.
All other plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset only when it is probable that the expenditure will result directly in future economic benefits to the Group, and the cost can be measured reliably.
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment is as follows: Group occupied buildings normally 30 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years Equipment 3 5 years The useful economic life and residual value are reviewed on an annual basis.
Where the carrying value of an asset is deemed to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired as outlined in the significant accounting policies note.
Gains and losses on disposal are recognised based on the carrying amount of the asset.
On disposal of buildings, any associated revaluation surplus is transferred to retained earnings.
Investment property and rental income Investment property is stated at fair value.
The fair value methodology is set out in more detail in note 26.
Unrealised gains and unrealised losses or changes are recognised in net investment return in the consolidated income statement.
Rental income from operating leases on investment property is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the length of the lease.
Policy acquisition costs Policy acquisition costs incurred in acquiring insurance contracts include commissions and premium taxes directly related to the writing or renewal of insurance policies.
These acquisition costs are deducted from unearned premiums and recognised in the consolidated income statement on the same basis as the unearned premiums.
Loan capital Loan capital comprises subordinated bonds which are initially measured at the consideration received less transaction costs.
Subsequently, loan capital is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events that are more likely than not to result in an outflow of economic resources in order to settle the obligation, and the amount of that outflow can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is recognised if the Group has a possible future obligation as a result of past events, and either the amount of the expected future outflow of economic resources or the likelihood of payment cannot be reliably estimated.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when either employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
Termination benefit expenses are recognised in the income statement at the earlier of the date when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer and the date when any related restructuring costs are recognised.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.
Own shares Own shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of shares.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 173 Appendices continued Other operating income Other operating income is comprised principally of: Administration fee income: is received from policyholders in order for certain changes to their policy or policyholder details within their period of cover and is recognised in full on the date that the change is made.
Premium policy instalment fee income: is received from policyholders as a finance charge on premiums paid in instalments and is recognised over the period that the instalments are made on a straight line basis.
Introductory commission income is received from third parties for introducing business to them and is recognised when the introduction is made.
Service income refers to income received for operating a settlement function primarily for the Group and its Global Network Partners which is recognised over the period in which the relevant business is earned.
Reinsurance commissions are recognised over the same period in which relevant expenses are recognised.
Share based payments The fair value of the employee share options and other equity settled share based payments is calculated at the grant date and recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
The vesting of share awards is dependent on service and performance conditions, as well as market conditions.
The assumption of the number of shares expected to vest is revised at the end of each reporting period, with the corresponding credit or charge recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where an option is cancelled by an employee, the full value of the option less any value previously recognised is recognised at the cancellation date.
The proceeds received by RSA upon exercise of share options, net of any transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within limits set by the Investment Association.
Further information on the share schemes the Group operates can be found in note 18 and in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Dividends The final dividend is recognised as a liability when approved at the Annual General Meeting.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases various properties and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Payments made under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
