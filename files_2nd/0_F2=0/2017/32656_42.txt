Property, Plant and Equipment Owned Assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful economic lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
Legal fees and other costs associated with the acquisition of a leasehold interest are capitalised within non-current other assets see note 14.
These costs are amortised over the life of the lease.
Rental income from operating leases where the Group is the lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: Freehold land not depreciated Warehouse 15 years on a straight line basis Long leasehold and freehold properties 2% per annum on a straight line basis Improvements to short leasehold properties life of lease on a straight line basis Computer equipment 3 - 4 years on a straight line basis Fixtures and fittings 5 - 7 years, or length of lease if shorter, on a straight line basis Motor vehicles 25% per annum on a reducing balance basis Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 13.

Property, Plant and Equipment continued Leased Assets Assets funded through finance leases and similar hire purchase contracts are capitalised as property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Future instalments under such leases, net of financing costs, are included within interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is included in finance costs, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments so as to give a constant charge on the outstanding obligation.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental costs, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Contingent rentals payable based on store revenues are accrued in line with the related sales and are charged as expenses in the period to which they relate.
The value of any lease incentives is recognised as deferred income and credited to the Consolidated Income Statement against rentals payable on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
The carrying amount of the Groups property, plant and equipment includes an amount of 1,068,000 2016: 122,000 in respect of assets held under finance leases.
