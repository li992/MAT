The net impact of these items on the Group profit before tax for the year is a debit of $30.9m 2016: debit of $17.0m.
The items fall into a number of categories, as summarised below: Restructuring in 2016 this related to the appointment of a new CEO, CFO and costs associated with reorganising the management structure.
In subsequent years, the cost relates to the IFRS 2 cost of buyouts associated with the new CEO and CFO.
Business transformation in 2016 a review to define the long term strategy and internal transformation necessary was performed by an external consultant.
The costs incurred in 2017 relate to delivery of the global key account management, and working capital improvement, phases of the transformation, following this strategic review.
Increase in environmental provisions due to additional remediation work identified assessments at the end of both 2016 and 2017 have resulted in an increased provision required at a number of our legacy sites.
As these costs relate to non-operational facilities the costs associated are classed as adjusting items.
Increase in environmental provisions due to change in discount rate in 2016, the rate used to discount future liabilities relating to the environmental provisions was reduced from 4.5% to 2.5%.
This resulted in an increase in the environmental provisions required.
As the provisions relate to non-operational facilities the interest charge required was classed as classed as an adjusting item.
There has been no change in the discount rate for 2017.
102 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information SummitReheis acquisition costs these are one-off costs associated with the acquisition of SummitReheis primarily the write off of the set-up costs of the previous financing syndicate, now replaced by a new facility, bank and lawyers fees, retention bonuses for SummitReheis employees.
Uplift due to fair value of SummitReheis inventory in accordance with IFRS 3, inventory held within SummitReheis was revalued to fair value on acquisition, representing an uplift of $4m over the book value.
As all stock acquired with SummitReheis was sold by the year end, the additional expense recognised in cost of sales due to this fair value uplift has been classed as an adjusting item.
Sale of Colourants business and closure of Jersey City site in March 2017, Elementis disposed of its US Colourants business and closed the Jersey City site.
The profit on sale of the business and costs associated with the closure of the site are classed as adjusting item.
The site is planned to be disposed of in 2018.
Release of legal provision during 2017 the Group released $0.7m from a provision set up in 2015 relating to a regulatory case in Europe.
Disposal costs in 2017 Elementis incurred a number of costs associated with the sale of the Delden facility and Surfactants business planned for 2018.
As the profit on sale of the assets and business will be treated as an adjusting item in 2018 the one-off associated costs are being classed similarly in 2017.
Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition in previous years, Elementis has not adjusted operating profit for the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition.
Following the acquisition of SummitReheis, the Directors reviewed this policy and concluded that excluding such a charge from the operating profit would provide readers of the accounts with a better understanding of the Groups results on its operating activities and, as such, this charge is now included within adjusting items.
Tax on adjusting items this is the net impact of tax relating to the adjusting items listed above.
Adjusting tax item US tax reform Elementis has recognised a reduction in the net deferred tax liability arising from timing differences and US goodwill amortisation recognised in the US for tax purposes.
Given the one-off nature of the reduction to future tax liabilities, this has been recognised as an adjusting item.
To support comparability with the financial statements as presented in 2017, the reconciliation to the adjusted consolidated income statement is shown below.

106 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information The tax charge on profits represents an effective rate after adjusting items for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 20.5% 2016: 11.7%.
It has operations in several jurisdictions and benefits from cross border financing arrangements.
Accordingly, tax charges of the Group in future periods will be affected by the profitability of operations in different jurisdictions, changes to tax rates and regulations in the jurisdictions within which the Group has operations, as well as the ongoing impact of the Groups funding arrangements.
In 2017, the Groups tax rate was significantly impacted by the reduction in US tax rates as a result of the Tax and Jobs Act which made several major changes to the US tax code including importantly a reduction in the US Federal tax rate to 21% from 35%.
This change gave rise to the $51.0m tax adjusting item.
The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows: 2016 2016 2017 2017 restated restated $million per cent $million per cent Profit before tax on continuing operations 78.5 76.1 Tax on ordinary activities at 19.25 per cent 2016: 20.00 percent 15.1 19.2 15.2 20.0 Difference in overseas effective tax rates 1.2 1.5 3.0 3.9 Income not taxable and impact of tax efficient financing 4.3 5.5 4.6 6.0 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 6.0 7.6 0.5 0.6 Adjustments in respect of prior years 1.2 1.5 0.9 1.2 Recognition of adjusting tax items 51.0 64.9 Tax charge and effective tax rate for the year 34.2 43.6 7.2 9.5 T he UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 17% from 1 April 2020: this reduction was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
All of the goodwill at 31 December 2017 relates to Elementis Specialty Products 2016: $318.5m, as the goodwill associated with Elementis Surfactants 2017: $3.1m, 2016: $2.7m is now classed as held for sale.
There is no goodwill associated with Elementis Chromium.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
In order to stress test the results over a wider range of conditions, management has expanded its testing to include discount rates based on a variety of equity risk premiums and different capital structures that reflect the potential variability of risk within the CGUs.
In this exercise a range of discount rates from 10.1% to 15.0% 2016: 11.3% to 12.3% was used.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent 3 year plans approved by management for the next 3 years and extrapolates cash flows for the following 17 years based on estimated growth rates of 2.5%.
The rates do not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets and also take into account potential, future capacity limitations for the Chromium business.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The results of the impairment testing using the assumptions discussed show that there is no indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The brand intangibles represent the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the Deuchem, Fancor, Watercryl, Hi-Mar acquisitions and SummitReheis.
The Group with the exception of SummitReheis considers these to have significant and ongoing value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate to assign these assets an indefinite useful life and the brand relating to SummitReheis is being amortised over a period of 3 years.
Brand intangibles are tested annually for impairment using similar assumptions to the goodwill testing.
The remaining intangible assets comprise the value ascribed to customer lists, patents and non-compete clauses, which are being amortised over periods of 5 to 24 years.
Other intangible assets classed as held for sale at 31 December 2017 relate to capitalised REACh costs of $2.4m 2016: $1.6m.

These provisions have been derived using a discounted cash flow methodology and reflect the extent to which it is probable that expenditure will be incurred over the next 20 years.
Included within environmental provisions are amounts in respect of all anticipated costs related to the closure and remediation of the Chromium UK site at Eaglescliffe.
Of the $2.3m charged to environmental provisions, $1.1m relates to additional remediation work identified at Eaglescliffe and Castle Hayne.
Further details on these charges are included within adjusting items note 5.
Whilst a range of outcomes is possible, the Directors believe that the reasonably possible range for the environmental provision is from $21.3m to $38.0m.
Self-insurance provisions represent the aggregate of outstanding claims plus a projection of losses incurred but not reported.
The self-insurance provisions are expected to be utilised within 5 years.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables fromcustomers.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
No single customer accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups revenue.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through a treasury policy that imposes graduated limits on the amount of funds that can be deposited with counterparties by reference to the counterparties credit ratings, as defined by Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125% of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.
At the year end the Group had $158.2m 2016: $113.4m of undrawn committed facilities, of which $131.6m expires after more than 1 year.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the USdollar and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 100% of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than 1 year from the reporting date.
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily US dollar, but also euro and pounds sterling.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.
The Groups investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by USdollar denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of a subsidiarys net assets.
114 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to borrow at both fixed and floating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest profile.
The policy does not require that a specific proportion of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.
Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held within the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
In respect of the US schemes, management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise investment returns, without excessive risk taking, in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded benefit obligations: management is assisted by external advisers in this regard.
In respect of the UK scheme, the investment strategy is set by the trustees and the Board is kept informed.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage and sale requirements: such contracts are not settled net.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors the return on operating capital employed ROCE both including and excluding goodwill, as defined on page 14.
The Groups target is to achieve a ROCE including goodwill in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Groups savings related share option schemes.
At present, employees, including Executive Directors, hold 0.1% 2016: 0.2% of ordinary shares, or 1.5% 2016: 1.8% assuming that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.
The new dividend policy is set out in the Chairmans statement on pages 2 and 3.

118 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Basis for determining fair values The Group measures fair values in respect of financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 13, using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements: Level 1: Quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs.
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments.
Derivatives level 2 The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest based on government bonds.
Non-derivatives financial liabilities level 2 Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows: 2017 2016 per cent per cent Borrowings 1.0-3.3 0.9-2.7 At both 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017 there was no difference between the carrying value and fair value of financial instruments.
OPERATING LEASES 2017 2016 $million $million Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 4.5 4.1 At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2017 2016 $million $million Within 1 year 4.2 3.9 In the second to fifth years inclusive 9.5 10.0 After 5 years 9.9 12.6 23.6 26.5 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties, plant and machinery.
Leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benefits for the majority of employees and Executive Directors.
At 31 December 2017 the main schemes in the UK and US were of the defined benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post retirement medical benefit PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
Other employee benefit schemes included in the table overleaf at 1 January 2017 relate to 2 unfunded pension schemes, a long term service award scheme in Germany and a special benefits programme for a small number of former employees of the Eaglescliffe plant.
During 2017 with the acquisition of SummitReheis the Group also acquired 2 further unfunded pension schemes and two long term service award schemes all in Germany.
These have also been included within this category.

To reduce volatility risk a liability driven investment LDI strategy forms part of the Trustees management of the UK defined benefit schemes assets, including government bonds, corporate bonds and derivatives.
The bond assets category in the table above includes gross assets of $557.6m 2016: $477.3m and associated repurchase agreement liabilities of $135.8m 2016: $117.8m.
Repurchase agreements are entered into with counterparties to better offset the schemes exposure to interest and inflation rates, whilst remaining invested in assets of a similar risk profile.
Interest rate and inflation rate derivatives are also employed to complement the use of fixed and indexed linked bonds in matching the profile of the schemes liabilities.
All equities, bonds and liquidity funds have quoted prices in active markets.
Other assets include insured annuities, an insurance fund and various swap products.
Within the UK pension scheme, the current asset allocation is approximately 30% in a liability matching fund consisting of gilts fixed interest and index linked, bonds, cash and swaps, 20% in a buy and maintain fund and 50% in an investment fund that includes various equity and equity like funds.
The aim of the trustees is to manage the risk relative to the liabilities associated with the schemes investments through a combination of diversification, inflation protection and hedging of risk currency, interest rate and inflation risk.
The US scheme currently has approximately 50% of its asset value invested in a range of equity funds designed to target higher returns and thus reduce the pension deficit, with the balance invested in fixed income bonds and cash.
The strategy is that as the deficit reduces, a greater proportion of investments will be made into liability matching funds.

The principal assumptions used by the actuaries for the major schemes have been updated by the actuaries at the balance sheet date and were as follows: UK US % % 2017 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2 3.00 3.45 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1 N A Discount rate 2.4 3.4 Inflation 3.2 2.0 2016 Rate of increase in salaries 4.30 3.00 3.45 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.10 N A Discount rate 2.60 3.85 Inflation 3.30 2.00 The assumed life expectancies on retirement are: UK US 2017 2016 2017 2016 years years years years Retiring at 31 December 2017 Males 23 23 21 21 Females 25 25 22 22 Retiring in 20 years Males 25 25 21 21 Females 26 26 23 23 The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 3.4% 2016: 3.85% per annum and a health care cost trend of 6.5% 2016: 6.5% per annum for claims pre age 65 reducing to 4.5% per annum by 2021 2016: 4.5%.
Actuarial valuations of retirement benefit plans in other jurisdictions have either not been updated for IAS 19 purposes or disclosed separately because of the costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.
At 31 December 2017, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations for the major schemes was as follows: UK: 14 years US: 10 years.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increased decreased by 0.5% Decreased increased by 7% Rate of inflation Increased decreased by 0.5% Increased decreased by 5% Rate of salary growth Increased decreased by 0.5% Increased decreased by 0% Rate of mortality Increased by 1 year Increased by 5% These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement of the defined obligation following a change in a particular assumption in isolation, assuming no other changes in market conditions.

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS The Company has several share incentive schemes for certain Directors and employees of the Group.
A Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted in 2008 amended in 2010 and 2015 LTIP for selected senior executives including the Executive Directors, business presidents and general counsel.
In 2017, LTIP awards were extended to include the members of the Executive Leadership team ELT.
A shadow LTIP was introduced for an ELT member based in China.
This is structured in almost all respects as the LTIP.
Awards of nil cost share options or conditional share awards are normally made annually and the maximum value of any grant to an individual is currently 2 times the CEOs basic salary.
Awards vest after 3 years and are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions over a 3 year period.
Vested awards are then exercisable for up to 7 years, subject to the rules of the plan.
For US participants prior to 2015 for tax reasons, the default practice is for options to be exercised at the date of vesting.
From 2015, US participants received awards structured as restricted stock units.
As reported in last years annual report, buyout awards were made to the CEO and CFO in 2016 representing forfeited remuneration when they left their previous employer to join Elementis.
Detail on vesting in 2017 can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 71 and 72.
At the 2012 Annual General Meeting AGM shareholders approved an approved and unapproved executive share option scheme 2012 ESOS.
This scheme replaced the previous approved and unapproved executive share option scheme 2003 ESOS which expired in 2013.
The last awards made under the 2003 scheme were in 2012.
Under the 2003 and 2012 ESOS, options were granted annually to purchase shares in the Company at an exercise price per share based on the Companys average mid-market closing share price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant with no discount applied.
The number of options granted were based on a percentage of the participants basic salary.
Options vested after 3 years and were subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions.
Vested options were then exercisable for up to 7 years, subject to the rules of the schemes.
The Company operates 2 shadow executive share option schemes for a number of executives, who are employed or based in China, that are structured the same in almost all respects as the 2003 and 2012 ESOS.
As mentioned above, it is proposed that the renewed 2018 LTIP will replace the 2012 ESOS.
The Company also operates a 2008 UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is a save as you earn SAYE scheme, under which UK employees can enter into contracts to save currently up to a maximum of 500 per month with a bank or building society for a period of 3 or 5 years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average mid-market closing share price over the 5 working days preceding the invitation date, discounted by 20%.
Options may be exercised typically within 6 months following the end of the savings period.
A similar scheme exists for US employees.
Under the 2008 US Sharesave Scheme Sharesave, US employees can enter into contracts to save up to a maximum of $2,000 per month with a bank or similarly approved institution, for a period of 2 years, and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average mid-market closing share price on the date of the grant, discounted by 15%.
Options may be exercised typically within 3 months following the end of the savings period.
Options granted under the 2 savings based schemes are held subject to the rules of the schemes.
Options were valued as shown in the table below using the binomial option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2017 2016 Fair value per option pence 145.0 142.6 Expected volatility per cent 29.0 28.0 Risk free rate per cent 0.2 0.5 Expected dividend yield per cent 4.1 1.9 124 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $2.8m 2016: $2.3m related to share based payment transactions during the year.
These shadow options are included in the calculation of the total expenses recognised by the Group related to share based payments.
Awards made as one-off agreements that borrow from the terms of the LTIP.
These options include cash settled shadow LTIPs granted to a number of executives on the same basis as the LTIP with the same performance conditions and exercise provisions.
These shadow LTIPs are included in the calculation of the total expenses recognised by the Group related to share based payments.
The closing balance of 2017 LTIP shown above include approximately 44,000 shadow LTIPs.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company is a guarantor to the UK pension scheme under which it guarantees all current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently participating in the pension scheme to make payments to the scheme, up to a specified maximum amount.
The maximum amount of the guarantee is that which is needed at the time the guarantee is called on to bring the schemes funding level up to 105% of its liabilities, calculated in accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund PPF guarantee, as having such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.

DIVIDENDS An interim dividend of 2.70 cents per share 2016: 2.70 cents was paid on 29 September 2017 and the Group is proposing a final dividend of 6.10 cents per share 2016: 5.75 cents for the year ended 31 December 2017.
In 2016 a special dividend of 8.35 cents per share was declared and paid.
The total dividend for the year, is 8.80 cents per share 2016: normal dividend 8.45 cents, 16.80 cents including the special dividend.
The amount payable for the final dividend, based on the anticipated number of qualifying ordinary shares registered on the record date, is $28.3m.
The payment of this dividend will not have any tax consequences for the Group.
KEY MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION 2017 2016 $million $million Salaries and short term employee benefits 4.7 3.4 Other long term benefits 0.6 0.4 Share based payments 1.7 1.6 7.0 5.4 The key management compensation given above is for the Board and the business president, Chromium.
Directors remuneration is set out in the Directors remuneration report on pages 55 to 76.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES As is the case with other chemical companies, the Group occasionally receives notices of litigation relating to regulatory and legal matters.
A provision is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and that the probability of a material outflow is not remote, the Group would disclose a contingent liability.
In 2013 the British Government through HMRC introduced a UK tax incentive for certain group financing arrangements.
In October 2017, the European Commission opened a State aid investigation into the rules relating to this incentive under the UK controlled foreign company regime.
HMRC has provided certain information and maintains that the exemption and the way it is applied does not represent unfair State aid.
Elementis could be impacted by the outcome of this investigation as it has, along with many other UK based multinationals, benefited from the arrangements.
No provision for this potential liability has been provided in these financial statements as the final outcome remains uncertain.
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE There were no significant events after the balance sheet date.

ACQUISITION On 24 March 2017 the Group acquired all the shares SRLH Holdings, Inc. SummitReheis, for an initial cash consideration of $370.3m, rising to $370.9m after closing working capital adjustments.
SummitReheis is a high quality, high margin specialty chemicals platform that produces a range of critical active ingredients and materials tailored for use in personal care, pharmaceutical and dental products.
SummitReheis antiperspirant actives business more than 60% of its sales is the global leader in the manufacture and sale of active ingredients for antiperspirants and has long standing relationships with key consumer product companies across the Americas, Europe and Asia.
The acquisitions had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Book value at Fair value Fair value of acquisition adjustments assets acquired Note $million $million $million Intangible assets 10 73.8 85.3 159.1 Property, plant and equipment 11 18.9 18.9 Inventories 18.7 3.0 21.7 Trade and other receivables 27.1 1.5 25.6 Trade and other payables 10.9 0.5 11.4 Cash and cash equivalents 9.1 9.1 Provisions 15 0.5 0.5 Employee retirement benefits 23 4.7 4.7 Corporation tax 2.6 2.6 Deferred tax 16 22.9 29.6 52.5 Total identifiable net assets acquired 111.7 56.2 167.9 Goodwill 203.0 Consideration paid, satisfied in cash 370.9 Cash acquired 9.1 Net cash outflow 361.8 The fair value adjustment to inventories of $3.0m is the net of an uplift due to fair value of $4.0m less an increase in provision for obsolescence of $1.0m.
The valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of material assets acquired were as follows.
Assets acquired Valuation technique Property, plant and A depreciated replacement cost was the primary method used to value the plant and equipment assets equipment in the USA.
Assets in Germany were subject to a fair value exercise in 2015 and given the proximity of the previous revised valuation to the Valuation Date, the assets in Germany will continue to be held at NBV.
Intangible assets For reporting purposes intangible assets were categorised into 3 groups: customer related, technology related and marketing related.
These have been valued through a combination of the income approach excess earnings, which is based on the forecasted future revenues and margins over the estimated remaining useful life, the Relief from Royalty method RfR, and the replacement cost approach.
Inventories The market approach has been used to determine the fair value based on the net realisable value of the inventory less costs to sell and a reasonable profit margin.
The consideration for the acquisitions has been allocated against identified net assets with the remaining balance recorded as goodwill.
The goodwill recognised on acquisition reflects both the capabilities of the acquired entities personnel and the synergistic opportunities going forward, neither of which can be allocated to an identifiable intangible asset.
There were a number of one-off costs associated with the acquisition of SummitReheis primarily the write off of the set-up costs of the previous financing syndicate, now replaced by a new facility, bank and lawyers fees, retention bonuses for SummitReheis employees, that have not been capitalised in accordance with IFRS 3.
However, these have been reflected as adjusting items within note 5 and recognised in operating profit and operating cash.
Acquisitions made during 2017 contributed $102.0m to the Groups revenue, $16.6m to the operating profit.
The estimated contribution of SummitReheis to the results of the Group, had the acquisition been made on 1 January 2017, and assuming that the fair value adjustments that arose on acquisition would have been the same at the earlier date, are as follows: 2017 $million Revenue 131.0 Operating profit 20.8 128 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 32.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ASSETS HELD FOR SALE On 11 December 2017, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of Elementis Specialties Netherlands BV, which carried out all of the Groups Surfactants operations.
The disposal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 and will generate cash flow for the expansion of the Groups other businesses.
The results of the discontinued operations, which have been included in the consolidated income statement, were as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 $million $million Revenue 47.8 43.1 Expenses 42.0 43.7 Profit before tax 5.8 0.6 Attributable tax expense 0.9 0.2 Net profit attributable to discontinued operations attributable to owners of the Company 4.9 0.8 Revenue includes $0.2m related to inter-segment sales in 2017 2016: $0.2m.
During the year, Elementis Specialties Netherlands BV contributed $7.2m 2016: $2.4m absorption to the Groups net operating cash flows and paid $2.6m 2016: $3.0m in respect of investing activities.
As the operations are expected to be sold within 12 months, they have been classified as a disposal group held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to substantially exceed the book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of these operations as held for sale.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operations classified as held for sale are as follows: Year ended 2017 $million Goodwill 3.1 Intangible assets 2.3 Property, plant and equipment 36.9 Inventories 6.8 Trade and other receivables 9.1 Cash and bank balances Total assets classified as held for sale 58.2 Trade and other payables 18.2 Tax liabilities 4.7 Bank overdrafts and loans Total liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale 22.9 Net assets of disposal group 35.3 33.
PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENT In previous years Elementis has not adjusted operating profit for the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition.
Following the acquisition of SummitReheis, the Directors reviewed this policy and concluded that excluding such a charge from the operating profit will provide readers of the accounts with a better understanding of the Groups results on its operating activities and, as such, this charge is now included within adjusting items.
Due to this change in accounting policy, the prior year comparatives have therefore been restated to provide comparable information.
