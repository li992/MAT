This change in accounting policy has not led to any change in any balance reported within the Companys own financial statements.
JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES The preparation of financial statements requires the exercise of judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
Italso requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant estimates and judgements relevant to the Companys financial statements are broadly the same as those for the consolidated Group financial statements as detailed in note 1 on page 116.
The only additional risk is around that of impairment in investments in subsidiaries, which is detailed further within note D on page 138.

D. INVESTMENTS Investments are initially stated at cost.
Investments are tested for impairment when an indication of impairment becomes apparent.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future cash flows from the investment.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Company is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that any of its investments may be impaired.
Where an indication of impairment exists the Company makes a formal estimate of recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount estimated as the value-inuse of the asset if the carrying value of the subsidiarys net assets is less than the carrying value of the Companys investment in it the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
The Company is required to exercise judgement in estimating the recoverable value of subsidiaries.
Estimation is required with regard to subsidiarys value-in-use in a similar way to that described in note 7 on page 120 in relation to the estimates used in estimating the recoverable value of intangible assets.

The terms of the intercompany loan mirror the terms of the external convertible loans detailed in note 13 to the consolidated Group financial statements.

The intercompany loan has a stated interest rate of 8.5% payable on the outstanding par value of all unredeemed convertible loans held by SMF.
Upon any conversion of the US$400 million convertible loans the Company will receive a redeemable preference share inSMF from external bondholders.
