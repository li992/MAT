Accounts Notes to the Accounts 1 Segmental analysis The executive Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined in IFRS 8 regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position at both a consolidated and divisional level.
Each division is an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8 in that the executive Board assess performance and allocates resources at this level.
All of the divisions have been aggregated in to one reporting segment on the basis that they share similar economic characteristics, including: national supply agreements are in place for key inputs including materials.
debt is raised centrally and the cost of capital is the same at each division.
sales demand at each division is subject to the same macroeconomic factors, such as mortgage availability and government policy.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Operating Review on pages 22 to 25.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations at a consolidated and divisional level when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation of resources.

8 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the Trust which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: Earnings Weighted Earnings per Earnings Weighted Earnings per average share average share number of number of ordinary ordinary shares shares 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 000 Number p 000 Number p For basic earnings per ordinary share 454,057 122,511,626 370.6 402,902 122,558,261 328.7 Dilutive effect of options and awards 536,577 1.6 291,845 0.7 For diluted earnings per ordinary share 454,057 123,048,203 369.0 402,902 122,850,106 328.0 93 Bellway p. l. c.

102 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 About Us Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information 24 Employee benefits a Retirement benefit obligations The Group sponsors the Bellway plc 1972 Pension Scheme the Scheme which has a funded defined benefit arrangement which is closed to new members and to future service accrual.
The Group also sponsors the Bellway plc 2008 Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan GSIPP which is a defined contribution contract-based arrangement.
Contributions of 4.068 million 2016 3.867 million were charged to the income statement for the GSIPP.
Defined contributions have been excluded from the assets and liabilities.
Role of Trustees The Scheme is managed by the Trustees, who are appointed by either the Company or the members.
The role of the Trustees is to manage the Scheme in line with the Scheme trust deed and rules, to act prudently, responsibly, honestly, impartially and in the interests of all beneficiaries.
The main responsibilities of the Trustees are to agree with the employer the level of contributions to the Scheme, to make sure these contributions are paid, to decide how the Schemes assets are invested so the Scheme is able to meet its liabilities and to oversee that the payment of benefits, record keeping and administration of the Scheme complies with the Scheme trust deed and rules and legislation.
Funding UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently i. e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 31 July 2014 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2017.
With regard to the Scheme, regular contributions made by the employer over the financial year were nil 2016 1.21 million.
The employer paid no special contributions 2016 nil and reimbursed the pension fund 0.40 million 2016 0.25 million for expenses incurred by the fund.
The Group is expected to make no regular contributions during the year ending 31 July 2018.
Regulation The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose key statutory objectives in relation to UK defined benefit plans are: to protect the benefits of members of occupational pension schemes.
to promote, and to improve understanding of the good administration of work-based pension schemes.
to reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the Pension Protection Fund.
to maximise employer compliance with employer duties and the employment safeguards introduced by the Pensions Act 2008.
Risk The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant are: Risk Description Asset volatility The Schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
However, a significant proportion of the Schemes assets are invested in growth assets, such as equities, that would be expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term but create volatility and risk in the short-term.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, with higher inflation increasing the liabilities.
However, there are caps of either a 3% or 5% p. a. increase in place to limit the effect of higher inflation.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes liabilities are to provide a pension for the life of the member, with any increase in life expectancy also increasing the Schemes defined benefit obligation.

Diversified growth funds are pooled funds invested across a diversified range of assets with the aim of giving long-term investment growth with lower short-term volatility than equities.
Actuarial assumptions The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date: 2017 2016 % per annum % per annum Discount rate 2.55 2.40 Future salary increases 3.70 3.50 Allowance for pension in payment increases of RPI or 5% p. a. if less 3.10 2.90 Allowance for deferred pension increases of CPI or 5% p. a. if less 2.20 2.00 Allowance for commutation of pension for cash at retirement 50% of maximum 50% of maximum 104 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 About Us Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 July 2017 are based on the S2PxA tables and allow for future improvement in mortality.
The tables used imply the following life expectancies at age 65: Male retiring at age 65 in 2017 23.0 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2017 24.9 years Male retiring at age 65 in 2037 24.8 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2037 26.7 years Sensitivities The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above.
The following table summarises the effect on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if different assumptions were used: Assumption Change in assumption Change in liabilities % Discount rate 0.1% p. a.
Decrease by 1.7% Future salary increases 0.1% p. a.
Increase by 0.1% Inflation RPI 0.1% p. a.
Increase by 1.4% Mortality 1 year life expectancy Increase by 3.0% The calculations for the sensitivity analysis are not as accurate as a full valuation carried out using these assumptions.
Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.
b Share-based payments The Group operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP, a share matching plan SMP, deferred bonus plans DBP and 2003 DBP, an employee share option scheme ESOS and Savings Related Share Option Schemes SRSOS, all of which are detailed below.
Awards under the LTIP and SMP have been made to executive directors, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, and senior employees, with awards under the 2003 DBP also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2014 Employee Share Option Scheme 2014 ESOS is an approved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under this scheme.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
As at 31 July 2017 no options had been granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the LTIP and the SMP is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 65 to 68 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
Various small share option awards have been made to employees at divisional management level under the terms of the 2003 DBP.
There are no DBP awards outstanding.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 2,530.3p 2016 2,656.1p.
Valuation methodology For LTIP and SMP options, half of the performance criteria is based on TSR against comparator companies with the other half based on TSR measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
A simplified Monte Carlo simulation method has been used to determine the Groups TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
In the case of the DBP, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
For the 1996, 2005 and 2007 ESOSs, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled in a more sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
106 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 About Us Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
