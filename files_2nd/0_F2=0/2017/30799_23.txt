Notes to the financial statements The notes have been grouped into sections under five key categories: 1.
Land bank and other operating assets and liabilities 4. Financing 5.
Other disclosures The key accounting policies have been incorporated throughout the notes to the financial statements adjacent to the disclosure to which they relate.
All accounting policies are included within an outlined box.
1.0 Basis of preparation 1.1 General information Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in Joint Ventures.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 1 March 2018.
1.2 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 to not present the Company income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all relevant periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, including the restatement as described in note 2.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and available for sale financial assets which are on a fair value basis.
1.3 Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the 12 months from date of approval of these financial statements.
The Directors reviewed detailed financial and covenant compliance forecasts covering the period to December 2018 and summary financial forecasts for the following two years.
Having started the year with net cash of 38.6 million, the Group generated a strong operating cash flow during 2017, increasing the net cash position to 144.9 million.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group held cash and cash equivalents of 170.1 million and had borrowings of 25.2 million.
On 3 December 2015, the Group entered into a new 250.0 million committed revolving credit facility that was extended for a further year both during 2016 and early in 2018.
This facility now expires in December 2022 and was fully available for drawdown at 31 December 2017.
For these reasons, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
1.4 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are any entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the comprehensive income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control.
These joint arrangements are in turn classified as: Joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities: and Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the comprehensive income and expense of its joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commenced.
The Group does not have any joint operations as the current time.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 119 Notes to the financial statements continued 1.5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
Key sources of judgement and estimation uncertainty for the Group Land held for development and housing work in progress The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
To assess the net realisable value of land held for development and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are combined as residential properties for sale and sold.
Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost.
Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a realisable value.
To the extent that the revenues which can be generated change, or the final cost to complete for the site varies from estimates, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different.
A review taking into account estimated achievable net revenues, actual inventory and costs to complete as at 31 December 2017 has been carried out, which has identified no material net movement in the carrying value of the provision.
These estimates were made by local management having regard to actual sales prices, together with competitor and marketplace evidence, and were further reviewed by Group management.
Should there be a future significant decline in UK house pricing, then further write-downs of land and work in progress may be necessary.
Further detail on the carrying value of inventories is laid out in note 3.1.
Defined benefit pension scheme The Group has an active defined benefit pension scheme, which is subject to estimation uncertainty.
Note 5.7 outlines the way in which this Scheme is recognised in the Groups Financial Statements, the associated risks and sensitivity analysis showing the impact of a change in key variables on the defined benefit obligation.
Customer care provision Following legal completion, the Group provides a two year warranty that covers any defects which arise during that period.
The level of provision per completion is based on actual costs incurred over the preceding twelve months.
Judgement is applied in determining whether this level of provision is sufficient, or whether it should be adjusted to reflect the level of outstanding customer rectification works at the balance sheet date.
Note 5.6 provides further detail of this provision.
Margin recognition The gross margin from revenue generated on each of the Groups individual sites within the year is recognised based on the latest forecast for the gross margin expected to be generated over the remaining life of that site.
The remaining life gross margin is calculated using forecasts for selling prices and all land, build, infrastructure and overhead costs associated with that site.
There is inherent uncertainty and sensitivity to external forces predominantly house prices and labour costs in these forecasts, which are reviewed regularly throughout the year by management and are addressed on pages 30 to 33.
The Company has no sources of estimation uncertainty.
1.6 Segment reporting The Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is the Board, notes that the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom.
There are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose, having taken into account the aggregation criteria provisions of IFRS8.
1.7 Impact of standards and interpretations effective for the first time The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2017: Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows - Changes in liabilities arising from financing activities and Amendment to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses have both come into effect with no significant impact on the Group.
| 120 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.8 Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2017, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements: IFRS9 Financial instruments replaces IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and is effective from 1 January 2018.
As the Group disposed of its shared equity assets during 2017 and does not presently hold any complex financial instruments, it is expected that the new standard will not have a material impact on the Groups reported results.
IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts, setting out new revenue recognition criteria particularly with regard to performance obligations which may have some impact on the timing of revenue recognised by the Group on certain contracts.
The standard will be effective for the period beginning 1 January 2018 and remains subject to industry interpretations and consensus.
However, based on the Groups assessment of the standard it is not thought to have an impact on private housing sales, which make up the majority of the Groups revenue and profit.
Land sales, which by their nature vary from year to year, are not expected to be impacted, but will continue to be reviewed as they occur in future to ensure that the treatment is consistent with the new standard.
Housing association sales are not expected to be impacted significantly, as the new standard allows for recognition over time, which is the Groups current practice.
However, the nature of the individual contracts will need to be assessed as they are entered into, and could give rise to a difference in timing of revenue recognition compared to IAS11.
If the standard were to be applied to the Groups 2017 financial statements, it would not have a material impact on the revenue reported by the Group.
IFRS16 Leases replaces IAS17 Leases and is effective from 1 January 2019.
The new standard requires all assets held by the Group under lease agreements of greater than 12 months in duration to be recognised as assets within the Balance Sheet, unless they are considered to be of low value.
Similarly, the present value of future payments to be made under those lease agreements must be recognised as a liability.
As the Group is increasingly entering into lease agreements as part of its strategy to reduce capital employed in its operations, it is expected that the implementation of the standard will increase both the assets and liabilities of the Group but will not have a material impact on its net assets.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payments, effective from 1 January 2018, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts regarding the implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, effective from 1 January 2018, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 40 Investment Property, effective from 1 January 2018, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Annual Improvements 2014-2016, effective from 1 January 2018, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, effective from 1 January 2019, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments, effective 1 January 2019, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
2.0 Result for the year Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property.
The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Revenue is recognised once the value of the transaction can be reliably measured and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Revenue is recognised on house sales at legal completion.
Revenue is recognised on land sales and commercial property sales from the point of unconditional exchange of contracts.
For affordable housing, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date and profit is recognised from the point at which the outcome of the contract is reasonably certain.
When it is probable that the total costs on a construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement immediately.
Where land is sold with material development obligations, the recognition of revenue and profit is deferred until the work is complete.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.

| Bovis Homes Group PLC 121 Notes to the financial statements continued Restatement - costs reclassified from administrative expenses to cost of sales Following the Groups structural and strategic review the accounting treatment of all project specific costs related to sales, legal, technical and build activities have been reviewed.
Where these have previously been included in the Groups administrative expenses we now consider it more appropriate to treat them as follows.
All sales costs will be reclassified within cost of sales impact on twelve months ended 31 December 2017: 20.7m: impact on year ended 31 December 2016: 19.2m.
All other project related costs identified above will be capitalised into work in progress and released to the Income Statement as we legally complete homes impact on twelve months ended 31 December 2017: 7.9m: impact on year ended 31 December 2016: 7.5m.
We believe this approach provides reliable and more relevant information.
We consider this a change in accounting policy and have restated prior year comparatives in the Groups Income Statement in line with IAS8.
The Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016 and the opening reserves at 1 January 2016 have not been restated as the impact is not considered material.

These costs include redundancies and onerous lease costs arising from merging certain business units, reducing from eight operating regions to seven and office relocations.
The exceptional administrative expenses have reduced the Groups income tax expense for the year by 772,000 2016: nil.

The average number of shares is increased by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the year.
This reflects the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price and fair value of future employee services.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the year.
Only share options which are expected to meet their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.

Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in section 5.2.
3.1 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated net selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished units.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost along with any expected overage.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, an adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost and written down on a straight-line basis over the life of the option.
Should planning permission be granted and the option be exercised, the option is not amortised during that year and its carrying value is included within the cost of land purchased.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Part exchange properties are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and include a carrying value provision to cover the costs of management and resale.
Any profit or loss on the disposal of part exchange properties is recognised within cost of sales in the Group Income Statement.

3.2 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, amounts recoverable on contracts and other debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Other debtors include amounts receivable from the Government in relation to the Help To Buy scheme.

The carrying value of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings represents the Companys maximum credit risk.
The Directors consider these amounts to be fully receivable at year end.
Receivables which are past due but not impaired are not material.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.
3.3 Trade and other payables Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is recognised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
| 124 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Government grants Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate.
Government grants are included within deferred income.
An ageing of land creditor repayments is provided in note 4.7.
4.0 Financing This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing activities.
4.1 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income, with the exceptions of impairment losses, the impact of changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method, which are recognised directly in the income statement.
Where the investment is disposed of, or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Given its materiality, this item was disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 125 Notes to the financial statements continued 2017 2016 000 000 Non-current asset - available for sale assets - 27,804 Available for sale financial assets related to legal completions where the Group has retained an interest through agreement to defer recovery of a percentage of the market value of the property, together with a legal charge to protect the Groups position.
The Group participates in three schemes.
Jumpstart schemes are receivable 10 years after recognition with 3% interest charged between years 6 to 10.
The HomeBuy Direct and FirstBuy schemes are operated together with the Government.
Receivables are due 25 years after recognition with interest charged from year 6 onwards at a base value of 1.75% plus annual RPI increments.
These assets are held at fair value being the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated date of recovery.
Key assumptions for shared equity 2017 2016 Discount rate, incorporating default rate - 9.0% Average house price inflation per annum for the next three years - 3.0% 2017 2016 000 000 Balance at 1 January 27,804 35,303 Redemptions 5,300 9,941 Disposals 22,270 - Revaluation taken through the income statement 1,355 - Imputed interest 1,121 2,442 Balance at 31 December - 27,804 During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group disposed of or redeemed assets with a fair value of 27.6m, at a profit of 1.2m, Included within these figures is the disposal of assets with a fair value of 22.3m to PMM Group on 31 October 2017 for 21.5m, net of transaction costs, generating a loss on disposal of 0.8m.
4.3 Bank and other loans Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Government grants The benefit on loans with an interest rate below market is calculated as the difference between interest at a market rate and the below market interest.
The benefit is treated as a Government grant.

The facility syndicate comprises six banks.
The facility includes a covenant package, featuring three covenants covering the Groups gearing ratio, consolidated tangible net worth and interest cover.
These covenants are tested semi-annually as per the previous facility agreement.
The overall financing cost of the new arrangement is marginally better than the previous facility.
On 11 April 2017 the Group entered into a loan facility agreement with the Homes and Communities Agency in relation to its development at Stanton Cross, Wellingborough.
The facility has a total aggregate of 35 million which the Group can draw down over a period until 31 March 2019 in order to support the funding of its infrastructure investment on the development.
The Group will then use an agreed proportion of its proceeds from the development to repay the loan once the aggregate proceeds exceed a threshold level.
The Groups latest estimates indicate that repayments of the loan will begin in 2021 and that the majority of the repayments will be made in periods beyond 5 years from 31 December 2017.
4.4 Net financing costs Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group is required to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and production of a qualifying asset, as part of the costs of that asset.
Inventories which are produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis over a short period of time are not qualifying assets.
The Group does not generally produce qualifying assets.

During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group purchased 275,000 shares at a total cost of 2,575,000.
There were 133,020 2016: 16,089 shares awarded under the Groups long-term incentive plan that vested during 2017 and accordingly the balance of the own shares held reserve reduced by 1,261,000 2016: 153,000.
The Group has suspended all rights on shares held by the Group in the Company.
4.6 Financial risk management Group The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future development.
In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide returns for shareholders over the housing market cycle as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a trading business.
The Groups capital comprises its shareholders equity, added together with its net borrowings, or less its net cash, stated before issue costs.
A five year record of its capital employed is displayed on page 131.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Groups decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders equity and debt financing, the Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing or cash in hand.
This is because the Group recognises that housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks.
The Group would seek to manage its capital base through control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its capital structure.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank and other loans and overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also utilises financial assets and liabilities such as trade payables or receivables that arise directly from operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk.
The valuation of the Groups available for sale financial assets is also impacted by housing market price fluctuations, giving rise to market price risk.
Company The Company only trades with other Group entities and is only exposed to credit risk on those intercompany balances.
Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
| 128 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 4.3.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Groups earnings, given that Group borrowings are variable in terms of interest rate.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would not have a material impact on the financial statements.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There are certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales.
The largest single amount outstanding at the year end was 4.8 million 2016: 9.6 million.
The amount is secured against consented land.
The Group retains these outstanding balances as trade and other receivables.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables equates to the Groups exposure to credit risk.
The Groups trade and other receivables and available for sale assets are secured against the following: 2017 2016 000 000 Consented land 7,027 17,282 Second charge against property 832 28,762 Unsecured 69,659 72,510 77,518 118,554 In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into a transaction.
This assessment is based upon management knowledge and experience.
In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
Company The Companys exposure to credit risk is limited as a result of all outstanding balances relating to companies within the Group.
c. Liquidity risk The Groups banking arrangements outlined in note 4.3 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk.
The Groups approach to assessment of liquidity risk is outlined in the going concern sub-section in the risk management section on page 28. d. Housing market price risk The performance of the UK housing market affects the valuation of certain of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress.

Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.
Balance at Total contracted Due within Between Between Between Between Due beyond Land creditor 31 Dec cash payment 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years estimated ageing 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 2017 246,742 252,183 168,297 44,377 11,248 8,321 4,390 15,550 2016 343,309 350,041 196,511 120,954 15,135 3,612 1,979 11,850 Bank and other loans Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows.
See note 4.3 for further details.
Trade and other receivables payables Other than land creditors, other financial liabilities and available for sale financial assets, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to reflect the fair value.
This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The Group uses an instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

5.0 Other disclosures This section includes all disclosures which are required by IFRS or the Companies Act which have not been included elsewhere in the financial statements.
5.1 Income tax expense Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable or receivable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Recognised in the income statement 2017 2016 Note 000 000 Current tax Current year 23,976 32,429 Adjustments for prior years 1,926 2,293 22,050 30,136 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 5.2 2,299 1,126 Adjustments for prior year 5.2 2,955 4,856 Total income tax in income statement 22,706 33,866 Reconciliation of effective tax rate 2017 2017 2016 2016 % 000 % 000 Profit before tax 114,001 154,714 Income tax using the domestic corporation tax rate 19.25 21,945 20.0 30,943 Non-deductible expenses and disposal of ineligible assets 0.3 388 0.5 856 Other 0.0 7 0.2 354 Change in tax rate 0.1 113 0.1 142 Adjustments to the tax charge in respect to the prior year 0.9 1,029 1.7 2,563 Total tax expense 19.9 22,706 21.9 33,866 | Bovis Homes Group PLC 131 Notes to the financial statements continued In the year ended 31 December 2016, Bovis Homes Limited recognised a provision for customer care house maintenance which was prudently treated as a general provision in the Companys draft corporation tax computation.
When the Companys final corporation tax computation was prepared the provision was reviewed and treated as a specific provision as the provision was FRS 101 compliant and was based on an analysis by site of the expected house maintenance expenditure required.
During the year Bovis Homes Limited agreed with HM Revenue & Customs to close an enquiry into the Companys corporation tax returns.
This resulted in additional corporation tax payable in the years ended 31 December 2015, 2016 and 2017 and ending 31 December 2018.
Consequently the tax charge in the income statement includes prior year adjustments to reflect the release of the deferred tax asset in respect of the customer care provision and the creation of a deferred tax liability in respect of tax charges that have crystallised in the current period and will crystallise in the year ending 31 December 2018 as a result of the closure of HM Revenue & Customs enquiry.
Recognised directly in Group statement of changes in equity or in the Group statement of comprehensive income 2017 2016 Note 000 000 Relating to actuarial movements on pension scheme Group statement of comprehensive income 5.2 1,630 2,624 Relating to share-based payments Group statement of changes in equity 5.2 49 8 Relating to available for sale financial assets Group statement of comprehensive income 5.2 288 - Relating to available for sale financial assets Group statement of changes in equity 5.2 - 909 Deferred tax recognised directly in Group statement of changes in equity or the 1,869 3,525 Group statement of comprehensive income 5.2 Tax assets and liabilities The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Current tax assets and liabilities The current liability of 16,855,000 2016: 13,885,000 represents the remaining balance of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior years.

This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on these rates.
Employee benefits The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a surplus of 2.1 million 2016: deficit of 6.6 million.
As at 31 December 2017, a deferred tax liability of 359,000 2016 tax asset: 1,120,000 was recognised.

| Bovis Homes Group PLC 141 Notes to the financial statements continued Transactions with Bovis Peer LLP and IIH Oak Investors LLP Bovis Homes Limited is contracted to provide property and letting management services to Bovis Peer LLP.
Fees charged in the period, inclusive of VAT, were 169,000 2016: 157,000.
None of these fees are outstanding at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
In 2014, Bovis Homes Limited entered into a Joint Venture arrangement with IIH Oak Investors LLP to hold 190 homes under a private rental scheme.
As at 31 December 2017, loans of 3,714,314 2016: 3,505,000 are outstanding with IIH Oak Investors at an interest rate of 6%.
Interest charges made in respect of loans were 214,000 2016: 220,000 5.6 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
5.7 Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit Method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs and credits are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Pension cost note The Company operates a UK registered trust based pension scheme that provides defined benefits.
Pension benefits are linked to the members final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement or date of leaving if earlier.
The Trustees are responsible for running the Scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules, which sets out their powers.
The Trustees of the Scheme are required to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the Scheme.
There is a requirement that one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the Scheme.
There are three categories of pension scheme members: Active members: currently employed by the Company Deferred members: former employees of the Company Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the balance sheet date.
The majority of benefits receive increases linked to inflation subject to various caps.
The valuation method is known as the Projected Unit Method.
The approximate overall duration of the Schemes defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2017 was 18 years.
| 142 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Risks Through the Scheme, the Company is exposed to a number of risks: Asset volatility: the Schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, however the Scheme invests significantly in equities and other growth assets.
These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation subject to the appropriate caps in place.
The majority of the Schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
However, the caps in place limit the potential impact of higher inflation.
The Trustees and Company manage risks in the Scheme through the following strategies: Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
Pensionable Salary cap: Pensionable Salary increases are capped at 2.5% pa.
Therefore, the impact on the Scheme of the Company granting salary increases above 2.5% is limited.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group makes contributions to one defined benefit scheme that provides pension benefits for employees upon retirement.

During 2016, scheme assets were invested in cash and liability driven instruments LDIs, moving away from bonds and gilts, and in November 2017 further scheme assets were invested in LDIs in order to increase the level of liability hedging.
The liabilities within a defined benefit pension scheme are particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate applied to future liabilities which is determined by the long term yield on investment grade corporate bonds or gilts and the level of inflation see sensitivity analysis table below.
LDIs aim to reduce the exposure of a pension scheme to these risks by holding assets which behave in the same way as the schemes liabilities when interest rates or inflation, or future expectations of them, change.

Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.
Pensionable Salary increases are capped at 2.5% pa, as currently assumed, therefore changing the underlying assumption for future salary increases by 0.5% has no impact on the liabilities.

The results have been updated to 31 December 2017 for accounting purposes by a qualified independent actuary.
As part of this valuation exercise, the mortality assumptions for the scheme are now based on the SAPS 2 all tables and Core CMI 2016 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% pa.
These tables imply the following remaining life expectancy at age 63.
Remaining years of life at 63 Current age at 43 Current age at 63 Men 25.9 24.1 Women 27.9 26.0 The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every 3 years.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by the Scheme Actuary for the Trustees as at 30 June 2016.
This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of 36.1 million however allowing for changes in market conditions and in particular the strong returns on the Schemes assets, the Scheme Actuary estimated that the Schemes shortfall had decreased to around 25m as at 31 December 2017.
In addition, the closure of the Scheme to future accrual has now been agreed with effect from 28 February 2018.
To eliminate the shortfall at 31 December 2017, the Trustee and the Company have agreed that three contributions of 5.5m will be paid into the Scheme by the Company by 28 February 2018, 31 January 2019 and 31 January 2020.
Alongside the latest valuation and the recovery plan the Company has also agreed the principles of a longer-term plan to fide-risk the pension scheme assets and liabilities position.
