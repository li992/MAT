Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy section is described in the note to which it relates.
This section also shows new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, and whether they are effective in 2017 or later years.
We explain how these changes are expected to impact the financial position and performance of the Group.
The financial statements consolidate those of ITV plc the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interests in associates and jointly controlled entities.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
As required by European Union law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002, the Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS, and approved by the Directors.
The financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historical cost.
Where other bases are applied, these are identified in the relevant accounting policy.
The parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
Going concern At 31 December 2017, the Group was in a financial net debt position with a positive gross cash balance.
Even though the Group is in a net current liability position, its strong balance sheet and continued generation of significant free cash flows enables the Group to meet its obligations and has enabled further investment.
As a part of the going concern test, the Group reviews forecasts of the television advertising market to determine the impact on ITVs liquidity position.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current available funding.
The Group also continues to focus on development of the non-advertising business, and evaluates the impact of further investment against the cash headroom of the business.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for at least 12 months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and available-for-sale investments Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in the entity is stated as one line item at cost plus the investors share of retained post-acquisition profits and other changes in net assets.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in, but not control or jointly control, the financial and operating decisions of an entity.
These investments are also accounted for using the equity method.
Investments where the Group concludes it does not have significant influence are deemed available-for-sale.
These investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case it is valued at cost and assessed for impairment.

All other assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Groups operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.
Classification of financial instruments The financial assets and liabilities of the Group are classified into the following financial statement captions in the statement of financial position in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Loans and receivables separately disclosed as cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables: Available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: Financial assets liabilities at fair value through profit or loss separately disclosed as derivative financial instruments in assets liabilities and included in other payables contingent consideration : and Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost separately disclosed as borrowings and trade and other payables.
Judgement is required when determining the appropriate classification of the Groups financial instruments.
Details on the accounting policies for measurement of the above instruments are set out in the relevant note.
Where unconditional rights to set off financial instruments exist, the Group presents the relevant instruments net in the statement of financial position.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Group recognises a financial asset or liability when it becomes a party to the contract.
Financial instruments are no longer recognised in the statement of financial position when the contractual cash flows expire or when the Group no longer retains control of substantially all the risks and rewards under the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits with a maturity of less than or equal to three months from the date of acquisition and cash held to meet certain finance lease commitments.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to approximate fair value.
Foreign currencies The primary economic environment in which the Group operates is the UK and therefore the consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
Where Group companies based in the UK transact in foreign currencies, these transactions are translated into pounds sterling at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Where there is a movement in the exchange rate between the date of the transaction and the year end, a foreign exchange gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is implemented on certain foreign currency firm commitments, for which the effective portion of any foreign exchange gains or losses is recognised in other comprehensive income note 4.3.
Where a forward currency contract is used to manage foreign exchange risk and hedge accounting is not applied, any impact of movements in currency for both the forward currency contracts and the assets and liabilities is taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into pounds sterling at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of Group companies outside of the UK are translated into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate.
The revenue and expenses of these companies are translated into pounds sterling at the average monthly exchange rate during the year.
Where differences arise between these rates, they are recognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income.
12 121 1 Financ Financiial al S Statem tateme en nt ts s Notes to the Financial Statements Section 1: Basis of Preparation continued Exchange differences arising on the translation of the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates are recognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, an interest in a joint venture or an associate, the related translation reserve is released to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of estimation, judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: Revenue recognition note 2.1 Business combinations note 3.3 and note 3.4 In addition to the above, the areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: Defined benefit pension note 3.7 Taxation note 2.3 New or amended EU endorsed accounting standards The table below represents new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards relevant to the Groups results that are effective in 2017: Accounting Standard Requirement Amendments to IAS 7 The amendments introduce an additional disclosure that will enable users of the Statement of Cash Flows financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.

Based on the Directors analysis, the amendments outlined above do not have a material impact on the Groups financial position or performance for the year ended 31 December 2017.
EU endorsed accounting standards effective in future periods The Directors considered the impact on the Group of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments that are currently endorsed but not yet effective.
IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 are both effective for the period beginning 1 January 2018 and, while the Directors do not expect these standards to have a significant impact on the Groups results, they highlight the conclusions from the impact assessment below.
IFRS 16 is effective for the period beginning 1 January 2019.
The Directors have detailed the status of the impact assessment below.
1 12 22 2 ITV ITV p pllc c Annua Annula Repo l Reprt and A ort and A cco cc unts 2 ounts 2 017 0 17 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Section 1: Basis of Preparation IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 requires the Group to identify distinct promises in contracts with customers that qualify as performance obligations.
The consideration receivable from customers must then be allocated between the performance obligations identified.
An assessment of the impact on all of the Groups material revenue streams has been completed.
The impact on the Groups revenues and results is not material for either the Group or for the individual divisions, Broadcasting & Online and ITV Studios.
The changes to the current accounting policies on adoption of IFRS 15 require the Group to reclassify various costs which are now deemed to be attributable to revenue within the income statement.
The impact on the results for the year ending 2017, which is not considered material to the Group, either individually or collectively, will be: Income statement account Impact NAR revenue Reduction of 11 million Other commercial income Reduction of 1 million Online, pay & interactive revenue Increase of 10 million Operating costs Reduction of 2 million There is no impact on either profit or adjusted EBITA for the year for the Group or for an individual division.
The Directors adopted IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 on a fully retrospective basis and will present, within the 2018 financial statements, a restatement of the comparative periods.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is also effective 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 introduces new models for classification of financial assets and accounting for credit losses.
Hedging rules have been amended to allow hedge accounting to be applied to more risks.
The analysis of the impact focused on the following items: Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities: Trade receivables impairment: and Recognition of hedging instruments and on the type of hedging relationships.
No material impacts were identified compared with the existing accounting treatment.
IFRS 16 Leases is effective 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 will change lease accounting for lessees under operating leases.
Such agreements will require recognition of an asset, representing the right to use the leased item, and a liability, representing future lease payments.
Lease costs such as property rent will be recognised in the form of depreciation and interest, rather than as an operating cost.
The detailed assessment of impact on the Groups performance is ongoing, with the current focus on the completeness of the lease data.
During the early impact assessment, the Group has reviewed the current accounting for existing key agreements, including satellite, transponder and playout agreements, and concluded that those do not meet lease definition under the regulations of IFRS 16, and therefore should continue to be classified as service agreements as presented within these financial statements.
The adoption is likely to have a material impact on the presentation of the Groups assets and liabilities, mainly due to property leases.
Due to the quantity of leases under review, the Group has not substantially completed the assessment of lease contracts under the new accounting standard.
Therefore, a quantification of the impact on the Groups results cannot currently be estimated.

This section analyses the Groups profit before tax by reference to the activities Keeping 2.1 Profit performed by the Group and an analysis of key operating costs.

This reflects the way the business is managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group.
This section therefore also shows each divisions contribution to total revenue and adjusted EBITA.
Accounting policies Revenue recognition Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and equivalent sales taxes, and comprises the sale of products and services to third parties.
Judgement is required when determining the appropriate timing and amount of revenue that can be recognised, specifically around whether there is a firm contract and whether the service has been provided and if so, whether there is a fixed or reasonably determinable price that is reasonably certain to be collected.
Complexity in advertising revenue recognition is driven by intricate automated and manual processes involved in measuring the value delivered to the customer.
Revenue is recognised when the Group has transferred both the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue recognition criteria for the Groups key classes of revenue are as follows: Applicable segment Class of revenue Recognition criteria Broadcast & Online Advertising NAR on transmission Video on Demand VOD as audience targets are met Sponsorship across the period of transmission of the sponsored programme or series Pay over the term of the contract or per subscriber or download Participation Interactive as the service is provided or the event occurs and Brand Extensions on delivery of episode and acceptance by Studios Programme production the customer Programme distribution rights when the contract is signed and content is available for exploitation Format and licences at the point in time when the licence is transferred and the customer is able to use and benefit from the licence or over the licence period if continued involvement of the Group is required Digital: archive on delivery of content one-off or over the contract period in a manner that reflects the flow of content delivered top-up 1 124 24 ITV ITV p plc lc A A nnual nnua Repo l Reprt orand t and A Acco ccunts ount2017 s 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Section 2: Results for the Year The results for the year aggregate these classes of revenue into four significant categories: 2017 2016 2017 2016 m % of total m % of total NAR Broadcast & Online 1,591 44% 1,672 47% Non-NAR Broadcast & Online 484 460 ITV Studios: Productions 1,307 1,089 ITV Studios: Distribution 275 306 Total Non-NAR 2,066 56% 1,855 53% Total revenue from continuing operations 3,657 100% 3,527 100% Segmental information Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are determined in a manner that is consistent with how the business is managed and reported to the Board of Directors.
The Board is regarded as the chief operating decision-maker.
The Board considers the business primarily from an operating activity perspective.
The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 are therefore Broadcast & Online and ITV Studios, the results of which are outlined in the following tables: Broadcast & Online ITV Studios Consolidated 2017 2017 2017 m m m Total segment revenue 2,075 1,582 3,657 Intersegment revenue 2 523 525 Revenue from external customers 2,073 1,059 3,132 Adjusted EBITA 599 243 842 Broadcast & Online ITV Studios Consolidated 2016 2016 2016 m m m Total segment revenue 2,143 1,395 3,538 Intersegment revenue 463 463 Revenue from external customers including discontinued operations 2,143 932 3,075 Less: Discontinued operations note 2.5 11 11 Revenue from external customers 2,132 932 3,064 Adjusted EBITA including discontinued operations 636 243 879 Less: Operating loss from discontinued operations note 2.5 6 6 Adjusted EBITA 642 243 885 Revenue of 397 million 2016: 320 million was generated in the US during the year: the US represented 330 million 2016: 346 million of non-current assets at year end.
Adjusted EBITA is before exceptional items and includes the benefit of production tax credits.
It is shown after the elimination of intersegment revenue and costs.
This measure represents the continuing operations.
The Groups principal operations are in the United Kingdom.
Revenue from external customers in the United Kingdom is 2,272 million 2016: 2,370 million, and revenue from external customers in other countries is 860 million 2016: 694 million.
The Operating and Performance Review provides further detail on ITVs international revenues.
Intersegment revenue, which is earned on arms length terms, is mainly generated from the supply of ITV Studios programmes to Broadcast & Online for transmission primarily on the ITV network.
This revenue stream is a measure that forms part of the Groups strategic priority of building a strong international content business, as producing and retaining rights to the shows broadcast on the ITV network benefits the Group further from subsequent international content and format sales.
In preparing the segmental information, centrally managed costs have been allocated between reportable segments on a methodology driven principally by revenue, headcount and building occupancy of each segment.
This is consistent with the basis of reporting to the Board of Directors.
12 125 5 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued There is one media buying agency 2016: one acting on behalf of a number of advertisers that represent the Groups major customers.
This agency is the only customer that individually represents over 10% of the Groups revenue.
Revenue of approximately 561 million 2016: 552 million was derived from this customer.
This revenue is attributable to the Broadcast & Online segment.
Broadcast & Online The Group operates the largest commercial family of channels in the UK and delivers content through multiple platforms.
In addition to linear television broadcast, the Group delivers its content on the ITV Hub, catch up services on pay platforms, and through direct content deals.
Content commissioned and scheduled by this segment is funded primarily by television advertising, where revenue is generated from the sale of audiences for advertising airtime and sponsorship.
Other sources of revenue are from: online advertising: HD digital channels on pay platforms e. g. Sky and Virgin : SDN revenue which generates licence sales for DTT Multiplex A : and participation revenue which includes interactive sales from competitions and the ITV Choice subscription service in other countries.
ITV Studios ITV Studios is the Groups international content business, creating and producing programmes and formats that return and travel, namely drama, entertainment and factual entertainment.
ITV Studios UK is the largest commercial producer in the UK and produces programming for the Groups own channels, accounting for 66% of ITV main channel spend on commissioned programming 2016: 63%.
Programming is also sold to other UK broadcasters such as the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky.
ITV America is the leading unscripted independent producer of content in the US and is growing its scripted presence by increasing investment in high-profile dramas.
ITV Studios also operates in six other international locations, being Australia, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands primarily Talpa and the Nordics, where content is produced for local broadcasters.
This content is either locally created IP or formats that have been created elsewhere by ITV, primarily in the UK and the Netherlands.
Global Entertainment and Talpa Global, ITVs distribution businesses, license ITVs finished programmes and formats and third-party content internationally.
Within this business, we also finance productions both on and off ITV to acquire global distribution rights.
Adjusted EBITA The Directors assess the performance of the reportable segments based on a measure of adjusted EBITA.

Depreciation Depreciation in the year was 30 million 2016: 31 million, of which 11 million 2016: 13 million relates to Broadcast & Online and 19 million 2016: 18 million to ITV Studios.
A further 11 million of accelerated depreciation relating to assets made redundant as a result of the property project has been recorded as an exceptional item in 2017.

The Group has assessed the contracts under the new accounting standard IFRS 16, and consequently has reassessed the transponder assets under the current accounting standard, IAS 17.
As a result, the Group has re-presented the transmission supply agreements as service agreements as opposed to operating leases.
The impact of this is to remove the transponder assets from the operating lease disclosures in this note and disclose them instead as a commitment within note 3.1.
There is no impact on the income statement, financial position or cash flow of the Group for this presentational change.
The Groups operating leases relate to offices, studio properties and other assets such as cars and office equipment.
Property leases run for terms ranging from five to 20 years, depending on the expected operational use of the site.
Leases may include break clauses or options to renew options to renew are not included in the commitments table.
Lease payments are generally subject to market review every five years to reflect market rentals, but because of the uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such changes have not been reflected in the table above.
None of the lease agreements include contingent rentals.
The total operating lease expenditure recognised during the year was 21 million 2016: 19 million and total sublease payments received were 1 million 2016: 1 million.
Audit fees The Group engages KPMG LLP KPMG on assignments additional to its statutory audit duties where its expertise and experience with the Group are important and are in line with Groups policy on auditor independence.
Fees paid to KPMG and its associates during the year are set out below: 2017 2016 m m For the audit of the Groups annual accounts 0.6 0.6 For the audit of subsidiaries of the Group 0.6 0.6 Audit-related assurance services 0.2 0.2 Total audit and audit-related assurance services 1.4 1.4 Taxation advisory services 0.2 Other assurance services 0.1 Total non-audit services 0.3 Total fees paid to KPMG 1.4 1.7 There were no fees payable in 2017 or 2016 to KPMG and associates for the auditing of accounts of any associate or pension scheme of the Group, internal audit services, services relating to corporate finance transactions entered into or proposed to be entered into, by or on behalf of the Group or any of its associates.
Fees paid to KPMG for audit and other services to the Company are not disclosed in its individual accounts as the Group accounts are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.

it simple Exceptional They are typically gains or losses arising from events that are not considered part of items the core operations of the business e. g. costs relating to capital transactions, such as professional fees on acquisitions.
These items are excluded to reflect performance in a consistent manner and are in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Accounting policies Exceptional items as described above are highlighted on the face of the income statement.
Subsequent revisions of estimates for items initially recognised as exceptional are recorded as exceptional items in the year that the revision is made.
Gains or losses on disposal of non-core assets are also considered exceptional due to their nature and impact on the Groups underlying quality of earnings.
Exceptional items Operating and non-operating exceptional items are analysed as follows: 2017 2016 Charge credit Ref.
m m Operating exceptional items: Acquisition-related expenses A 96 131 Restructuring and property project costs B 30 14 Insured trade receivable provision C 27 Pension curtailment cost D 19 Total operating exceptional items 153 164 Non-operating exceptional items: Loss on sale of non-current assets 1 Total non-operating exceptional items 1 Total exceptional items before tax 154 164 Tax on exceptional items 12 15 Total exceptional items net of tax 142 149 A Acquisition-related expenses Acquisition-related expenses of 96 million includes 86 million 2016: 110 million relating to performance-based, employment-linked costs to former owners mainly in relation to Talpa Media.
The remaining 10 million 2016: 21 million is primarily comprised of integration costs and professional fees mainly financial due diligence and legal costs.
See note 3.4 for further details on acquisitions.
B Restructuring and property project costs In 2017, the Directors made the decision to redevelop the Groups headquarters at The London Television Centre for which the Group owns the freehold.
This requires relocating staff and studios for 4 to 5 years to alternative accommodation before moving back into a new freehold building.
Therefore, the Group has taken rented office and studios space in the interim while the new headquarters are constructed.
During the course of the construction the Group will ring fence all incremental costs in relation to the redevelopment.
Move costs, dual rates and rent will be treated as exceptional costs in the financial statements as they relate to the one-off property project that runs over several years but the Group will no longer incur them after the return to The London Television Centre.
In 2017, the Group incurred 24 million of costs being: Dual running costs of 7 million while the properties were vacant during refurbishment: 11 million of accelerated depreciation relating to assets made redundant as a result of the property project: 3 million of dilapidation provisions relating to these new property leases: and Other incremental one-off project costs of 3 million.
As a result of the review of the Groups London property needs, the Directors have decided to close The London Studios business incurring 6 million of redundancy costs in 2017.
12 129 9 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued In 2016, 14 million of costs were incurred as a result of a one-off project stemming from the Group-wide commitment to reduce the overhead cost base by 25 million.
This cost was primarily comprised of redundancies across the Broadcasting, ITV Studios and Shared Services divisions as well as professional support to successfully plan and implement the project.
C Insured trade receivable provision The insured trade receivable provision of 27 million relates to the unpaid portion of revenue from the four-year licence deal for The Voice of China with Talent Television and Film Co. Ltd Talent, the revenue for which was fully recognised in 2016 in accordance with accounting standards as the Group had no further obligations under the terms of the agreement.
Following a breach of the agreement by Talent as they had not fulfilled their payment obligations, the Group have taken back the licence for The Voice of China.
The Group is pursuing Talent vigorously for the 30 million still due under the agreement.
Further, the Group has credit insurance in place and a claim has been submitted.
Whilst the Directors continue to pursue the amounts due and believe there is ultimately no material financial impact, the Group will need to reflect a provision against this unpaid amount in its 2017 results.
Whilst the Directors are confident in recovering the amount due, the accounting standards set very specific requirements for the recognition of contingent assets, which is how the recovery of the amount due will be accounted for.
As discussions with the insurers and the claim against Talent are in progress, at this early stage of pursuing recovery the Group is not able to demonstrate sufficient certainty for accounting purposes to be able to recognise a cash receivable at the year end.
Accordingly, The Group has made a provision amounting to 27 million 30 million net of 3 million insurance excess against the Talent receivable recorded in the accounts in the year ended 31 December 2017.
The cash received in the future will also be treated as an exceptional item.
D Pension curtailment cost In 2016, following a member consultation, the Group decided to close the ITV Pension Scheme to future benefit accrual, resulting in a one-off non-cash curtailment cost of 19 million.
130 130 ITV ITV p plc lc A A nnual nnua Repo l Reprt orand t and A Acco ccunts ount2017 s 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Section 2: Results for the Year This section sets out the Groups tax accounting policies, the current and deferred Keeping 2.3 tax charges or credits in the year which together make up the total tax charge it simple Taxation or credit in the income statement, a reconciliation of profit before tax to the tax charge for the period and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income and directly in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transactions.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
The calculation of the Groups tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be fully determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due, which require judgement.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: The initial recognition of goodwill: The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore, involves judgement regarding the timing and level of future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group has the right of set-off.
13 131 1 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued Taxation Income statement The total taxation charge in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Current tax: Current tax charge on profit before exceptional items 110 134 Current tax credit on exceptional items 8 11 102 123 Adjustments to prior periods 2 10 104 113 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of temporary differences 13 18 Deferred tax credit on exceptional items 4 4 Impact of change in the statutory tax rate 6 1 11 23 Adjustments to prior periods 6 10 17 13 Total taxation charge in the income statement 87 100 In order to understand how, in the income statement, a tax charge of 87 million 2016: 100 million arises on a profit before tax of 500 million 2016: 553 million, the taxation charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 2017 2016 m m Profit before tax 500 553 Notional taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 19.25% 2016: 20% on profit before tax 96 111 Non-taxable income non-deductible expenses 35 25 Prior year adjustments 4 Other taxes 1 Previously unrecognised deferred tax asset 11 Current year losses not recognised 4 2 Impact of overseas tax rates 7 10 Impact of changes in tax rates 6 1 Production tax credits 32 28 Total taxation charge in the income statement 87 100 Non-deductible expenses are expenses that are not expected to be allowable for tax purposes.
Similarly, non-taxable income is income that is not expected to be taxable.
Adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcome is obtained on certain tax matters, which differs from expectations held when the related provision was made.
Where the outcome is more favourable than the provision made, the difference is released, lowering the current year tax charge.
Where the outcome is less favourable than our provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur.
The current tax charge includes a 2 million charge relating to prior years, and the deferred tax credit includes a 6 million credit relating to prior years.
Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are in relation to deferred tax assets arising on consolidation in relation to intangible assets which are now being brought on to the balance sheet in the current period.
Current year losses not recognised primarily relate to a capital loss arising on the write-down of an investment, as it is uncertain whether this loss can be utilised in future periods.
The impact of overseas tax rates reflects the fact that some of our profits are earned in territories other than the UK and taxed at rates different from the UK corporation tax rate.
This year, losses arising in higher taxed jurisdictions, which we recognise through deferred tax, give rise to a reconciling benefit.
The UK corporation tax rate fell from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and has been enacted to fall further to 17% from 1 April 2020.
These rates were enacted at the previous balance sheet date, and the carrying value of UK temporary differences were adjusted accordingly.
To the extent that temporary differences have unwound in the current year, this has given rise to a credit of 6 million 2016: charge of 5 million of which 2 million is recognised as a credit in the income statement and 4 million as a credit in other comprehensive income.
In addition, as a result of the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US, the Group has recognised a tax charge of 9 million through the 132 132 ITV ITV p plc lc A A nnual nnua Repo l Reprt orand t and A Acco ccunts ount2017 s 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Section 2: Results for the Year income statement, resulting from the revaluation of our US deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the US federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 1 January 2018.
Changes to enacted rates in other countries have given rise to a further credit of 1 million reported in the income statement.
The total impact of changes in tax rates is therefore a charge of 6 million in the income statement and a credit of 4 million in other comprehensive income.
The production tax credits included within the reconciliation above are UK High-End Television HETV tax credits and Childrens Television tax credits, which are part of a group of incentives provided to support the creative industries, and also Italian production tax credits.
The ability to access these tax credits is fundamental when assessing the viability of investment decisions in the production of high-end drama and childrens programmes.
Under IFRS, these production tax credits are reported within the total taxation charge in the income statement.
However, ITV considers them to be a contribution to production costs, and therefore working capital in nature, and excludes them from its adjusted tax charge, including them instead within Adjusted EBITA.
The effective tax rate is 17.4% 2016: 18.1%, and is the tax charge on the face of the income statement expressed as a percentage of the profit before tax.
In the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the effective tax rate is comparable to the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 19.25% in 2017 and 20% in 2016.
As explained in the Finance Review, the Group uses an adjusted tax rate to show how tax impacts total adjusted earnings in a way that is more aligned with the Groups cash tax position.
This year, the current year movement on origination and reversal of temporary differences excluding exceptional items is a credit of 13 million, compared with a credit of 18 million in 2016.
Taxation Other comprehensive income and equity As analysed in the table below, a deferred tax charge of 39 million on actuarial movements on pensions has been recognised in other comprehensive income 2016: 40 million credit.
A deferred tax charge of 1 million has been recognised in equity in respect of share-based payments 2016: 6 million.
A current tax credit of 1 million has also been recognised in equity in relation to share-based payments 2016: 2 million.

After netting off balances within countries, there is a deferred tax liability of 111 million and a deferred tax asset of 31 million 2016: deferred tax liability of 70 million and deferred tax asset of 17 million recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
13 133 3 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued The deferred tax balances relate to: Property, plant and equipment temporary differences arising on assets qualifying for tax depreciation: Temporary differences on intangible assets, including those arising on business combinations: Programme rights temporary differences on intercompany profits on stock: Pension scheme deficit temporary differences on the IAS 19 pension deficit: Temporary differences arising from the timing of the use of tax losses: Share-based compensation temporary differences on share schemes: and Other temporary differences on provisions and other items.
The deferred tax balance associated with the pension deficit reflects the current tax benefit obtained in the current year following the employer contributions of 80 million to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
The adjustment in other comprehensive income to the deferred tax balance primarily relates to the actuarial gain recognised in the period.
A deferred tax asset of 377 million 2016: 377 million in respect of capital losses of 2,217 million 2016: 2,215 million has not been recognised due to uncertainties as to whether capital gains will arise in the appropriate form and relevant territories against which such losses could be utilised.
For the same reasons, deferred tax assets of 13 million 2016: 19 million in respect of overseas losses that time expire between 2018 and 2026 have not been recognised.
In line with our accounting policy on current tax, provisions are held on the balance sheet within current tax liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions where management believe that it is probable that future payments of tax will be required.
At the balance sheet date, these tax provisions were not material for the Group.

Diluted EPS reflects any commitments made by the Group to issue shares in the future and so it includes the impact of share options.
Adjusted EPS is presented in order to show the business performance of the Group in a consistent manner and reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Adjusted EPS reflects the impact of operating and non-operating exceptional items on Basic EPS.

On the following pages, there are notes section covering working capital, non-current assets and liabilities, acquisitions and disposals, provisions and pensions.
Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 2.3.
Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates through Keeping 3.1 its trading activity.
The Group therefore defines working capital as distribution it simple Working rights, programme rights and production costs, trade and other receivables and capital trade and other payables.
Careful management of working capital ensures that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
Working capital is a driver of the profit to cash conversion ratio, a key performance indicator for the Group.
The Groups target profit to cash ratio on a rolling three year basis is at least 90%.
For those subsidiaries acquired during the year, working capital at the date of acquisition is excluded from the profit to cash calculation so that only subsequent working capital movements in the period controlled by ITV are reflected in this metric.
In the following section, you will find further information regarding working capital management and analysis of the elements of working capital.
1 Programme rights, other inventory and commitments Accounting policies Rights are recognised when the Group controls the respective rights and the risks and rewards associated with them.
Programme rights and production costs not yet utilised are included in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In assessing net realisable value for programmes in production, judgement is required when considering the contracted sales price and estimated costs to complete.
Broadcast programme rights Acquired programme rights which include films and sports rights are purchased for the primary purpose of broadcasting on the ITV family of channels, including VOD and SVOD platforms.
These are recognised within current assets as payments are made or when the rights are ready for broadcast.
The Group generally expenses these rights through operating costs over a number of transmissions reflecting the pattern and value in which the right is consumed.
Commissions, which primarily comprise programmes purchased based on editorial specification and over which the Group has some control, are recognised in current assets as payments are made and are generally expensed to operating costs in full on first transmission.
Where a commission is repeated on any platform, incremental costs associated with the broadcast are included in operating costs.
The net realisable value assessment for acquired and commissioned rights is based on estimated airtime value, with consideration given to whether the number of transmissions purchased can be efficiently played out over the licence period.

Programming commitments are transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business with programme suppliers, sports organisations and film distributors in respect of rights to broadcast on the ITV network.
Commitments in respect of these transactions, which are not reflected in the statement of financial position, are due for payment as follows: Transmission Programme Total 2017 m m m Within one year 32 455 487 Later than one year and not more than five years 132 709 841 More than five years 58 47 105 222 1,211 1,433 Re-presented Transmission Programme Total 2016 m m m Within one year 28 454 482 Later than one year and not more than five years 129 789 918 More than five years 92 112 204 249 1,355 1,604 Studios production costs Production inventory comprises the costs incurred by ITV Studios in producing a programme, where the programme is part way through the production process and not yet available for delivery to a broadcaster.
Inventory is recognised within current assets at the value of the production cost incurred, and is expensed in operating costs on delivery of episodes.
Also included here are dramas where production costs are partly funded by the commissioning network licence fee and tax credits, if available.
The remaining deficit is funded by the Group and is recovered by future distribution sales.
Once the production is complete, the deficit is classified as a distribution right.
The Studios programme rights and other inventory at the year end are shown in the table below: 2017 2016 m m Production costs 247 153 3.1.
2 Distribution rights Accounting policies Distribution rights are programme rights the Group buys from producers to derive future revenue, principally through licensing to other broadcasters.
These are classified as non-current assets as these rights are used to derive long-term economic benefit for the Group.
Distribution rights are recognised initially at cost and charged through operating costs in the income statement over a period not exceeding five years, reflecting the value and pattern in which the right is consumed.
Judgement is required when estimating future patterns of consumption.
Advances paid for the acquisition of distribution rights are disclosed as distribution rights as soon as they are contracted.
These advances are not expensed until the programme is available for distribution.
Up to that point, they are assessed annually for impairment through the reassessment of the future sales expected to be earned from that title.
The net book value of distribution rights at the year end is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Distribution rights 19 31 During the year, 35 million was charged to the income statement 2016: 38 million.

3 Trade and other receivables Accounting policies Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Where payments are not due for more than one year, they are shown in the financial statements at their net present value to reflect the economic cost of delayed payment.
The Group provides goods and services to substantially all its customers on credit terms.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
These estimates include such factors as historical experience, the current state of the UK and overseas economies and industry specific factors.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Due within one year: Trade receivables 311 315 Other receivables 51 39 Prepaid employment-linked consideration 21 Prepayments and accrued income 152 151 514 526 Due after more than one year: Trade receivables 19 12 Accrued income and other receivables 8 27 27 39 Total trade and other receivables 541 565 In 2016, prepaid employment-linked consideration of 21 million related to the acquisition of Talpa Media in 2015.
This represented the portion of the initial consideration of 150 million that was recoverable from the seller in the event he left within the initial two years following acquisition.
This amount was amortised over the two years to 31 March 2017 and recognised as exceptional expense see note 2.2.
330 million 2016: 327 million of total trade receivables, stated net of provisions for impairment, are aged as follows.
2017 2016 m m Current 275 299 Up to 30 days overdue 28 19 Between 30 and 90 days overdue 16 6 Over 90 days overdue 11 3 330 327 Movements in the Groups provision for impairment of trade receivables and accrued income can be shown as follows: 2017 2016 m m At 1 January 4 5 Charged during the year insured trade receivable provision note 2.2 30 Charged during the year other receivables 5 3 Unused amounts reversed 4 4 At 31 December 35 4 Of the provision total, 4 million relates to balances overdue by more than 90 days 2016: 3 million and less than 1 million relates to current balances 2016: 1 million.
30 million of the provision relates to the overdue Talent receivable, which is impairing 14 million of trade receivables and 16 million of accrued income.
The provision for these insured receivables, net of insurance excess, has been recognised as an exceptional expense see note 2.2.

4 Trade and other payables due within one year Accounting policies Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier.
The carrying value of current and non-current trade payables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other payables due within one year can be analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Trade payables 63 71 VAT and social security 67 61 Other payables 234 186 Acquisition-related liabilities employment-linked contingent consideration 34 72 Acquisition-related liabilities payable to sellers under put options agreed on acquisition 42 33 Accruals 371 332 Deferred income 218 205 1,029 960 3.1.

A depreciation expense equipment is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over time.
Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years the Group expects the asset to be used useful economic life.
If there has been a technological change or decline in business performance, the Directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.
If an assets value falls below its depreciated value, an additional impairment charge is made against profit.
This section also explains the accounting policies followed by ITV and the specific estimates made in arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that were revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004 the date of transition to IFRS are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition.
Leases Finance leases are those that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Determining whether a lease is a finance lease requires judgement as to whether substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred to the Group.
Estimates used by management in making this assessment include the useful economic life of assets, the fair value of the asset and the discount rate applied to the total payments required under the lease.
Assets held under such leases are included within property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included within borrowings.
The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on an effective interest basis.
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term see note 2.1 for further details of operating lease commitments.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated useful life of each asset and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: Asset class Depreciation policy Freehold land not depreciated Freehold buildings up to 60 years Leasehold improvements shorter of residual lease term or estimated useful life Vehicles, equipment and fittings 3 to 20 years Equipment includes studio production and technology assets.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until the point at which the asset comes into use by the Group.

In 2013, the Group acquired the freehold for the London Television Centre for 58 million, although the Directors view is that the fair value of the property would be significantly higher than the carrying value.

it simple Intangible These assets include formats and brands, customer contracts and relationships, assets contractual arrangements, licences, software development, film libraries and goodwill.
The cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has paid or, where there has been a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
In the case of goodwill, its cost is the amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over and above the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired.
The value of goodwill is the intangible value that comes from, for example, a uniquely strong market position and the outstanding productivity of its employees.
The value of intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, reduces over the number of years the Group expects to use the asset, the useful economic life, via an annual amortisation charge to the income statement.
Where there has been a technological change or decline in business performance, the Directors review the value of assets, including goodwill, to ensure they have not fallen below their amortised value.
Should an assets value fall below its amortised value, an additional impairment charge is made against profit.
This section explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the Directors in arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
The goodwill recognised by the Group has all arisen as a result of business combinations.
Goodwill is stated at its recoverable amount being cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to the business to which it relates.
Due to changes in accounting standards, goodwill has been calculated using three different methods depending on the date the relevant business was purchased.
Method 1: All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2009 were accounted for using the acquisition method.
Under this method, goodwill is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognition of any part of the business not yet owned non-controlling interests, less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration expected to be transferred in the future will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and recognised within other payables.
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The determination of fair value is based on discounted cash flows.
The key assumptions take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount rate.
Where less than 100% of a subsidiary is acquired, and call and put options are granted over the remaining interest, a non-controlling interest is initially recognised in equity at fair value, which is established based on the value of the put option.
A call option is recognised as a derivative financial instrument, carried at fair value.
The put option is recognised as a liability within other payables, carried at the present value of the put option exercise price, and a corresponding charge is included in merger and other reserves.
Any subsequent remeasurement of the put option liability is recognised within finance income or cost.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of net assets acquired can only be made within 12 months of the acquisition date, and only if fair values were determined provisionally at an earlier reporting date.
These adjustments are accounted for from the date of acquisition.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, are expensed as incurred.
The Directors consider these costs to reflect the cost of acquisition and to form a part of the capital transaction, and highlight them separately as exceptional items.
1 143 43 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Method 2: All business combinations that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 were accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2004.
Goodwill on those combinations represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and did not include the value of the non-controlling interest.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, were included in the cost of acquisition.
Method 3: For business combinations prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that time less accumulated amortisation up to 31 December 2003.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered, as permitted under IFRS 1.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are those that are distinct and can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
The main intangible assets the Group has valued are formats, brands, licences, contractual arrangements, customer contracts and relationships and libraries.
Within ITV, there are two types of other intangible assets: those assets directly purchased by the Group for day-to-day operational purposes such as software licences and development and intangible assets identified as part of an acquisition of a business.
Intangible assets acquired directly by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Those separately identified intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition or business combination are shown at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation.
Each class of intangible assets valuation method on initial recognition, amortisation method and estimated useful life is set out in the table below: Class of intangible Amortisation method Estimated useful life Valuation method asset Brands Straight-line 8 to 14 years Applying a royalty rate to the expected future revenue over the life of the brand.
Formats Straight-line up to 8 years Expected future cash flows from those assets existing at the Customer Straight-line or date of acquisition are estimated.
If applicable, a contributory up to 6 years charge is deducted for the use of other assets needed to contracts reducing balance exploit the cash flow.
The net cash flow is then discounted as appropriate back to present value.
Customer Straight-line 5 to 10 years relationships Contractual Straight-line up to 10 years Expected future cash flows from those contracts arrangements depending on existing at the date of acquisition are estimated.
If applicable, the contract a contributory charge is deducted for the use of other assets terms needed to exploit the cash flow.
The net cash flow is then discounted back to present value.
Licences Straight-line 11 to 29 years Start-up basis of expected future cash flows existing depending on at the date of acquisition.
If applicable, a contributory charge term of licence is deducted for the use of other assets needed to exploit the cash flow.
PSB licences are valued as a start-up business with only the licence in place.
Libraries and Sum of digits or up to 20 years Initially at cost and subsequently at cost less accumulated other straight-line as amortisation.

The Directors make estimates regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows derived from exploiting the assets being acquired.
The Directors then estimate an appropriate discount rate to apply to the forecast cash flows.
Such estimates are based on current budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates, operating costs and the expected useful lives of assets.
Judgements are also made regarding whether, and for how long, licences will be renewed: this drives our amortisation policy for those assets.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets or businesses being acquired.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are judged to be indefinite.
Indefinite life assets, such as goodwill, are not amortised but are tested for impairment at each year end.
Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position is less than its recoverable amount.
Determining whether the carrying amount of intangible assets has any indication of impairment requires judgement.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment test is performed by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset, or for goodwill the cashgenerating unit CGU, or group of CGUs, related to the goodwill.
Total assets which include goodwill are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value in use is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the asset.
In testing for impairment, estimates are used in deriving cash flows and the discount rates.
Such estimates reflect current market assessments of the risks specific to the asset and the time value of money.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with long-term forecasting.
If different estimates of the projected future cash flows or a different selection of an appropriate discount rate or long-term growth rate were made, these changes could materially alter the projected value of the cash flows of the asset, and as a consequence materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

A provision of 13 million has been recognised against onerous contracts and various assets and liabilities relating to Gurney Productions LLC, which includes 3 million write-off of goodwill.
The net effect of these provisions and the derecognition of non-controlling interest is less than 1 million see note 4.6.
Goodwill impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill for each CGU is represented as follows: 2017 2016 m m Broadcast & Online 386 386 SDN 76 76 ITV Studios 773 719 1,235 1,181 3 million of goodwill was written off in the ITV Studios CGU in relation to Gurney Productions LLC.
There has been no impairment charge for any CGU during the year 2016: nil.
When assessing impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates, specifically: pre-tax cash flow projections: long-term growth rates: and a pre-tax market discount rate.
Cash flow projections are based on the Groups current five year plan.
Beyond the five year plan, these projections are extrapolated using an estimated nominal long-term growth rate of 1.5% 2016: 2%.
The growth rate used is consistent with the long-term average growth rates for both the industry and the countries in which the CGUs are located and is appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The discount rate has been revised for each CGU to reflect the latest market assumptions for the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium and the net cost of debt.
There is currently no reasonably possible change in discount rate that would reduce the headroom in any CGU to zero.

Broadcast & Online goodwill also includes the goodwill arising on acquisition of UTV Limited in February 2016.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flow projections for this CGU are based include: the performance and share of the television advertising market: share of commercial impacts: programme and other costs: and the pre-tax market discount rate.
The key assumption in assessing the recoverable amount of Broadcast & Online goodwill is the size of the television advertising market.
In forming its assumptions about the television advertising market, the Group has used a combination of long-term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates, which place greater emphasis on recent experience.
Also as part of the impairment review, a sensitivity of up to -10% of growth was applied to 2018 and -8% to 2019 with no subsequent recovery, with no impairment identified.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in these assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
An impairment charge of 2,309 million was recognised in the Broadcast & Online CGU in 2008, as a result of the downturn in the short-term outlook for the advertising market.
The current year impairment review, set out above, results in significant headroom in excess of the 2008 impairment amount.
Even though the advertising market has substantially improved since then and the impaired assets are still owned and operated by the Group, due to accounting rules the impairment cannot be reversed.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 9.5% 2016: 10.4% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
SDN Goodwill was recognised when the Group acquired SDN the licence operator for DTT Multiplex A in 2005.
It represented the wider strategic benefits of the acquisition specific to the Group, principally the enhanced ability to promote Freeview as a platform, business relationships with the channels which are on Multiplex A and additional capacity available from 2010.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows are based are: income to be earned from renewals of mediumterm contracts: the market price of available multiplex video streams: and the pre-tax market discount rate.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of current contract terms, recent market transactions and in-house estimates of video stream availability and pricing.
As part of the impairment review, sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment identified 2018: -10% growth, 2019: 0% growth.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in the cash flow and availability assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 11.4% 2016: 11.7% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
ITV Studios The goodwill for ITV Studios has arisen as a result of the acquisition of production businesses since 1999.
Significant balances were created from the acquisition by Granada of United News and Medias production businesses in 2000 and the merger of Granada and Carlton in 2004 to form ITV plc.
ITV Studios goodwill also includes the goodwill arising from recent acquisitions since 2012, with the largest acquisitions being Leftfield in 2014, followed by Talpa in 2015.
The key assumptions on which the forecast cash flows for the whole CGU were based include revenue including international revenue and the ITV Studios share of ITV output, growth in commissions and hours produced, margins and the pre-tax market discount rate.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of extrapolation of historical trends within the business, industry estimates and in-house estimates of growth rates in all markets.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in the cash flow assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 10.8% 2016: 11.6% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
Following the acquisitions made by ITV Studios in 2017, the Directors considered how assets and resources are shared across the ITV Studios division and the level of integration within the management structure for the purposes of reporting and strategic decision-making.
They concluded that a single ITV Studios CGU continues to remain appropriate.
147 147 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued The following section outlines what the Group has acquired in the year.
Keeping 3.4 it simple Acquisitions Most of the deals are structured so that a large part of the payment made to the sellers consideration is determined based on future performance.
This is done so that the Group can both align incentives for growth, while reducing risk so that total consideration reflects actual performance, not expected.
IFRS accounting standards require some of this consideration to be included in the purchase price used in determining goodwill contingent consideration.
Examples of contingent consideration include top-up payments and recoupable performance adjustments.
Any remaining consideration is required to be recognised as a liability or expense outside of acquisition accounting put option liabilities and employmentlinked contingent payments known as earnout payments.
The Group considers the income statement impact of all consideration to be capital in nature and so excludes it from adjusted profit.
Therefore, for each acquisition below, the distinction between the types of consideration has been explained in detail.
Acquisitions During the year, the Group made payments totalling 54 million for five acquisitions.
All acquisitions have been included in the results of the ITV Studios operating segment.
The businesses fit with the strategy of strengthening the Groups existing position as a producer for major television networks in the UK, Europe, US and OTT platforms.
Tetra Media Studios SAS On 28 February 2017, the Group purchased 65.04% of the share capital of Tetra Media Studios SAS, a French television production group which specialises in drama, including flagship crime series Profilage, now in its seventh series, and political crime thriller Les Hommes fide lOmbre.
Tomorrow ITV Studios LLC On 1 April 2017, the Group gained control of Tomorrow ITV Studios LLC due to the conversion of its 75% preference share capital into 75% ordinary share capital.
The company produced Aquarius, a US period crime series, which aired on NBC, and is producing Snowpiercer, an action sci-fi drama series, expected to be released in the US in 2018.
World Productions Limited On 30 April 2017, the Group purchased 92% of the share capital of World Productions Limited, a company which specialises in producing drama series with titles including Line of Duty, an award-winning British police crime drama, and Born to Kill, a British thriller television mini-series.
Elk Production AB On 21 June 2017, the Group acquired 96% of the share capital of Elk Production AB.
Elk is one of the leading independent production companies in Sweden.
Key titles produced by the company include Ninja Warrior, an obstacle course competition series, Dessertmstarna, a dessert cooking competition, and award-winning TV series Wahlgrens and Parneviks.
Cattleya S. r. l. On 11 October 2017, the Group purchased 51% of the share capital of Cattleya Srl, an Italian scripted production company behind international hit TV dramas Gomorrah, Romanzo Criminale and Suburra, Netflixs first Italian original TV series.
Acquisition accounting: Put and call options have been granted over the non-controlling interest of all five acquisitions, exercisable over the next two to seven years.
The total maximum consideration for the acquisitions is capped at 418 million undiscounted.
All future payments are dependent on future performance of the business and linked to ongoing employment.
Goodwill totalling 85 million arising on these acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes and represents the value placed on the opportunity to grow the content produced by the Group.

The business fits with the strategy of strengthening the Groups free-to-air business and enables it to run a more efficient network.
The following section provides a summary of the acquisition.
UTV Limited On 29 February 2016, the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in UTV Limited which, together with its 100% subsidiary UTV Ireland Limited, owned the television assets of UTV Media plc, for cash consideration of 100 million.
UTV is the market-leading commercial broadcaster in Northern Ireland, broadcasting ITV content alongside high-quality local programming.
The strategic rationale for the acquisition was to purchase the Northern Irish Channel 3 licence.
Before ITVs acquisition, UTV Limited launched a new dedicated channel for the Republic of Ireland in 2015 via its subsidiary, UTV Ireland Limited.
Management concluded that the best prospect of delivering a strong and sustainable Irish broadcaster was to bring UTV Ireland under common ownership with TV3.
ITV therefore sold the company to Virgin Media, owner of TV3, on 30 November 2016, for consideration of 10 million.
Acquisition accounting: Intangibles, being the value placed on brands and licences, of 58 million were identified and goodwill was valued at 44 million.
Goodwill represents the value placed on the opportunity to diversify and grow the business by the Group.
The goodwill arising on acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Other fair value adjustments have been made to the opening balance sheet, though none of them are individually significant.

Keeping 3.5 Accounting for these investments, and the Groups share of any profits and losses, it simple Investments depends on the level of control or influence the Group is granted via its interest.
The three principal types of non-consolidated investments are: joint arrangements joint ventures or joint operations, associates and available-for-sale investments.
A joint arrangement is an investment where the Group has joint control, with one or more third parties.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence i. e. power to participate in the investees financial and operating decisions.
Any other investment is an available-for-sale investment.
Accounting policies For joint ventures and associates, the Group applies equity accounting.
Under this method, it recognises the investment in the entity at cost and subsequently adjusts this for its share of profits or losses, which are recognised in the income statement within non-operating items and included in adjusted profit.
Where the Group has invested in associates by acquiring preference shares or convertible debt instruments, the share of profit recognised is usually nil as no equity interest exists.
Available-for-sale investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case it is valued at cost and assessed for impairment.
The carrying amount of each category of our investments is represented as follows: 2017 2016 m m Joint ventures 2 4 Associates 68 60 Available-for-sale investments 4 12 74 76 The carrying amount of associates has increased in the year due to investments made in Blumhouse and Circle of Confusion, two independent studios focusing on original premium scripted and unscripted programming.
This was offset by the acquisition of a controlling stake in ITV Tomorrow Studios, in which the Group previously held an investment see note 3.4.
Further smaller investments have been made in line with Groups strategy to grow the international content business.

it simple Provisions A provision is made where the Group is not certain how much cash will be required to settle a liability, so an estimate is required.
The main estimates relate to the cost of holding properties that are no longer in use by the Group, the likelihood of settling legal claims and contracts the Group has entered into that are now unprofitable.
Accounting policies A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events, it is probable cash will be paid to settle it and the amount can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a financing cost in the income statement.
The value of the provision is determined based on assumptions and estimates in relation to the amount and timing of actual cash flows, which are dependent on future events.
Provisions The movements in provisions during the year are as follows: Contract Property Legal and Other provisions provisions provisions Total m m m m At 1 January 2017 2 21 23 Additions 3 3 6 Utilised 5 5 Released 1 1 At 31 December 2017 3 4 16 23 Provisions of 16 million are classified as current liabilities 2016: 19 million.
Unwind of the discount is nil in 2017 and 2016.
Contract provisions comprise onerous commitments on playout and related services that are not expected to be utilised over the remaining contract period.
Property provisions primarily relate to expected dilapidation costs at temporary rental properties.
Legal and Other provisions totalling 16 million 2016: 21 million primarily relate to potential liabilities that may arise as a result of Boxclever having been placed into administrative receivership, most of which relate to pension arrangements.
In 2011, the Determinations Panel of the Pensions Regulator determined that Financial Support Directions should be issued against certain Group companies, which would require the Group to put in place financial support for the Boxclever Scheme.
The Group is challenging this in the Upper Tribunal.
The timing of the Upper Tribunals decision is not yet clear.
The Directors, having taken advice, believe that they have a strong case.
There are significant points of legal principle at issue and consequently any potential liability may take a significant period to resolve.
The Directors continue to believe that the provision held is appropriate.
The utilisation of provisions during the year was due to settlement of various other legal matters.
152 152 ITV ITV p plc lc A A nnual nnua Repo l Reprt orand t and A Acco ccunts ount2017 s 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities In this note, we explain the accounting policies governing the Groups pension Keeping 3.7 schemes, followed by analysis of the components of the net defined benefit pension it simple Pensions deficit, including assumptions made, and where the related movements have been recognised in the financial statements.
In addition, we have placed text boxes to explain some of the technical terms used in the disclosure.
What are the Groups pension schemes?
There are two types of pension schemes.
A Defined Contribution scheme that is open to ITV employees, and a number of Defined Benefit schemes that have been closed to new members since 2006 and closed to future accrual in 2017.
In 2016, on acquisition of UTV Limited, the Group took over the UTV Defined Benefit Scheme, which remains open to future accrual.
What is a Defined Contribution scheme?
The Defined Contribution scheme is where the Group makes fixed payments into a separate fund on behalf of those employees participating in saving for their retirement.
ITV has no further obligation to the participating employee and the risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the Group.
Although the Trustee of the scheme makes available a range of investment options, it is the members responsibility to make investment decisions relating to their retirement benefits.
What is a Defined Benefit scheme?
In a Defined Benefit scheme, members receive payments during retirement, the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of service.
The Group makes contributions to the scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit pension deficit line on the consolidated statement of financial position.
It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets of the Scheme and its funding position.
The Trustee, appointed according to the terms of the schemes documentation, is required to act in the best interest of the members and is responsible for managing and investing the assets of the scheme and its funding position.
The Group has a Pension Steering Committee, which liaises with the Trustee and has oversight of the management of the pension schemes and underlying risks.
In the event of poor returns, the Group may need to address this through a combination of increased levels of contribution or by making adjustments to the scheme.
Schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments but in some cases security is required.
The accounting defined benefit pension deficit IAS 19 is different from the actuarial valuation deficit as they are calculated on the basis of different assumptions, such as discount rate.
The accounting defined benefit pension deficit IAS 19 figure is calculated as at the balance sheet date, and the actuarial deficit was calculated for the last triennial valuation as of 1 January 2014, with the 1 January 2017 valuation expected to be agreed in early 2018.
Accounting policies Defined contribution scheme Obligations under the Groups defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
For 2017, total contributions expensed were 18 million 2016: 16 million.
1 153 53 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Defined benefit scheme The Groups obligation in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme the Scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future retirement benefit that eligible employees members have earned during their services.
That benefit payable in the future is discounted to todays value and then the fair value of scheme assets is deducted to measure the defined benefit pension position.
The liabilities of the Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid using the projected unit method.
These calculations are complex and are performed by a qualified actuary.
There are many judgements and estimates necessary to calculate the Groups estimated liabilities, the main assumptions are set out later in this section.
Movements in assumptions during the year are called actuarial gains and losses and these are recognised in the period in which they arise through the statement of comprehensive income.
The latest triennial valuation of the ITV Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 1 January 2014 by an independent actuary appointed by the Trustee of the Scheme and agreed in early 2016.
The next triennial valuation will be as at 1 January 2017 and is expected to be agreed during H1 2018.
This will drive subsequent contribution rates.
An unfunded scheme in relation to four former Granada executives is accounted for under IAS 19 and the Group is responsible for meeting the pension obligations as they fall due.
The unfunded scheme has additional security compared with the ITV main scheme, in the form of a charge over gilts held by the Group.
Therefore, the 38 million securitised gilts have been classified as other pension assets to reflect the Groups net pension deficit.
In December 2016, following a member consultation, the Group decided to close the ITV Pension Scheme to future benefit accrual with effect from 28 February 2017.
Members benefits are no longer subject to a capped pensionable salary: the benefits are now linked to statutory revaluation until retirement.
This decision gave rise to a one-off, non-cash 19 million curtailment charge recognised in 2016.
On 29 February 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the assets and liabilities of UTV Limited, including responsibility for a defined benefit pension scheme.
Due to the size of the scheme, within this note the Directors present the results and position of the UTV Scheme combined with the existing ITV Schemes.
The next triennial valuation will be as at 30 June 2017 and is expected to be agreed during H1 2018.
Unless otherwise stated, references to the Schemes within this note refer to the ITV Pension Scheme, the unfunded scheme and the UTV Scheme combined.
The sponsoring company of the ITV Pension Scheme is ITV Services Limited, the unfunded scheme is Granada Group Limited and the UTV Scheme is sponsored by UTV Limited.
The defined benefit pension deficit Net pension deficit of 83 million at 31 December 2017 2016: 328 million is stated after including the unfunded scheme security asset of 38 million 2016: 39 million.
The totals recognised in the current and previous years are: 2017 2016 m m Total defined benefit scheme obligations 3,987 4,200 Total defined benefit scheme assets 3,866 3,833 Defined benefit pension deficit IAS 19 121 367 Presented as: Defined benefit pension surplus 16 Defined benefit pension deficit 137 367 Defined benefit pension deficit IAS 19 121 367 Other pension asset 38 39 Net pension deficit 83 328 The defined benefit pension surplus relates solely to the UTV Scheme.
The defined benefit scheme assets in the UTV Scheme were 130 million as at 31 December 2017 2016: 117 million and the defined benefit scheme obligations were 114 million 2016: 117 million.
The remaining sections provide further detail of the value of the Schemes assets and liabilities, how these are accounted for and the impact on the financial statements.

Keeping The areas that impact the defined benefit obligation the pension scheme liabilities it simple position at the year end are as follows: Current service cost the cost to the Group of the future benefits earned by members that relates to the members service in the current year.
This is charged to operating costs in the income statement.
Past service cost is a change in present value of the benefits built up by the members in the prior periods: can be positive or negative resulting from changes to the existing plan as a result of an agreement between ITV and employees or as a result of significant reduction by ITV in the number of employees covered by the plan curtailment.
Interest cost the pension obligations payable in the future are discounted to the present value at year end.
A discount factor is used to determine the current value today of the future cost.
The interest cost is the unwinding of one years movement in the present value of the obligation.
It is broadly determined by multiplying the discount rate at the beginning of the period by the updated present value of the obligation during the period.
The discount rate is a key assumption explained later in this section.
This interest cost is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement see note 4.4.
Actuarial gains or losses there are broadly two causes of actuarial movements: experience adjustments, which arise when comparing assumptions made when estimating the liabilities and what has actually occurred, and adjustments resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions e. g. movements in corporate bond yields or change in mortality.
Key assumptions are explained in detail later in this section.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised through other comprehensive income.
Benefits paid any cash benefits paid out by the Scheme will reduce the obligation.
One-off events for example, the acquisition of UTV Limited set out above.
The movement in the present value of the Groups defined benefit obligation is analysed below: 2017 2016 m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 4,200 3,446 Current service cost 2 7 Curtailment charge 19 Interest cost 107 131 Actuarial gain loss 121 664 UTV acquisition 98 Benefits paid 201 165 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 3,987 4,200 Of the above total defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017, 58 million relates to unfunded schemes 2016: 51 million, including the scheme in relation to the four former Granada executives.
1 155 55 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations What are the main assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations?
Keeping The main assumptions are: it simple An estimate of increases in pension payments: The life expectancy of members: The effect of inflation on all these factors: The discount rate used to estimate the present day fair value of these obligations: Future salary levels for the UTV Scheme: and Future pensionable salary levels for the UTV Scheme.
How do we determine the appropriate assumptions?
The Group takes independent actuarial advice relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions used.
IFRS requires that we estimate a discount rate by reference to high-quality fixed income investments in the UK that match the estimated term of the pension obligations.
The inflation assumption has been set by looking at the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds.
The inflation assumption is used as a basis for the remaining financial assumptions, except where caps have been implemented.
The discount rate has therefore been obtained using the yields available on AA rated corporate bonds, which match projected cash flows.
The Groups estimate of the weighted average term of the liabilities is 15 years 2016: 17 years.
The principal assumptions used in the Schemes valuations at the year end were: 2017 2016 Discount rate for: Past service liabilities 2.50% 2.60% Future service liabilities 2.50% 2.70% Inflation assumption for: Past service liabilities 3.15% 3.25% Future service liabilities 3.15% 3.20% Rate of pensionable salary increases UTV Pension Scheme 3.65% 3.75% 1 Rate of increase in pension payment LPI 5% pension increases 2.95% 3.15% Rate of increase to deferred pensions CPI 2.15% 2.25% 1.
The table below reflects published mortality investigation data in conjunction with the results of investigations into the mortality experience of Scheme members.
Those are disclosed further in this section.

it simple What are the pension Scheme assets?
At 31 December 2017, the Schemes assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities.
The tables below set out the major categories of assets.
Financial instruments are in place in order to provide protection against changes in market factors interest rates and inflation, which could act to increase the net pension deficit.
One such instrument is the longevity swap, which the Scheme transacted in 2011 to obtain protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the majority of pensioner members at that date.
Under the swap, the Trustee agreed to make pre-determined payments in return for payments to meet the specified pension obligations as they fall due, irrespective of how long the members and their dependants live.
The difference in the present values of these two streams of payments is reflected in the Scheme assets.
The swap had a nil valuation at inception and, using market-based assumptions, is subsequently adjusted for changes in the market life expectancy and market discount rates, in line with its fair value.
How do we measure the pension Scheme assets?
Defined benefit scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change due to the following: Interest income on scheme assets this is determined by multiplying the fair value of the Scheme assets by the discount rate, both taken as of the beginning of the year.
This is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement: Return on assets arise from differences between the actual return and interest income on Scheme assets and are recognised through other comprehensive income: Employers contributions are paid into the Scheme to be managed and invested: and Benefits and administrative expenses paid out by the Schemes will lower the fair value of the Schemes assets.
The movement in the fair value of the defined benefit schemes assets is analysed below: 2017 2016 m m Fair value of Scheme assets at 1 January 3,833 3,270 Interest income on Scheme assets 98 126 Return on assets, excluding interest income 51 416 Employer contributions 90 93 UTV acquisition 98 Benefits paid 201 165 Administrative expenses paid 5 5 Fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 3,866 3,833 The actual return on the Schemes assets, being the sum of the interest income on Scheme assets and return on Scheme assets, for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 149 million 2016: 542 million.
1 157 57 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued How are the Schemes assets invested?
The Trustee is responsible for deciding the investment strategy for the schemes assets, although changes in investment policies require consultation with the Group.
The assets are invested in different classes to hedge against unfavourable movements in the funding obligation.
When selecting the mix of assets to hold, and considering their related risks and returns, the Trustee will weigh up the variability of returns against the target long-term rate of return on the overall portfolio.
The fair value of the Schemes assets is shown in the following table by major category: Market value Market value 2017 2016 m m Liability hedging assets Fixed interest gilts 633 678 Index-linked interest gilts 1,456 1,135 Interest rate and inflation hedging derivatives swaps and repos 279 270 2,368 61% 2,083 54% Other bonds 865 22% 784 20% Return seeking investments Quoted equities 260 633 Infrastructure 88 95 Property 109 62 Hedge funds alternatives 193 222 650 17% 1,012 27% Other investments Cash and cash equivalents 240 183 Insurance policies 41 42 Longevity swap fair value 298 271 17 46 1% Total Scheme assets 3,866 100% 3,833 100% Included in the above are overseas assets of 978 million 2016: 1,304 million, comprised of quoted equities of 244 million 2016: 565 million and bonds of 734 million 2016: 739 million.
The Trustee entered a longevity swap in 2011, which provides cash flow certainty by hedging the risk of increasing life expectancy over the next 70 years for 11,700 of current pensioners at inception covering 1.7 billion of the pension obligation.
The fair value of the longevity swap equals the discounted value of the projected net cash flows resulting from the contract and has reduced in value in 2017, mainly due to a decrease in gilts yields over the year.
158 158 ITV ITV p plc lc A A nnual nnua Repo l Reprt orand t and A Acco ccunts ount2017 s 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities Defined pension deficit sensitivities Which assumptions have the biggest impact on the Scheme?
Keeping It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used it simple may have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and statement of financial position.
This sensitivity to change is analysed below to demonstrate how small changes in assumptions can have a large impact on the estimation of the defined benefit pension deficit.
The Trustee manages the investment, mortality and inflation risks to ensure the pension obligations are met as they fall due.
The investment strategy is aimed at the valuation obligation rather than IAS 19 defined pension deficit value.
As such, the effectiveness of the risk hedging strategies on a valuation basis will not be the same as on an accounting basis.
Those hedging strategies have significant impact on the movement in the net pension deficit as assumptions change, offsetting the impacts on the obligation disclosed below.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of Scheme assets, which may or may not offset the changes in assumptions.
Changes in assumptions have a different level of impact as the value of the net pension deficit fluctuates, because the relationship between them is not linear.
The analysis below considers the impact of a single change in principal assumptions on the defined benefit obligation while keeping the other assumptions unchanged and does not take into account any risk hedging strategies: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 60 million Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Increase by 60 million Increase by 0.1% Increase by 15 million Rate of inflation Retail Price Index Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 25 million Increase by 0.1% Increase by 10 million Rate of inflation Consumer Price Index Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 10 million Life expectations Increase by one year Increase by 110 million The sensitivity analysis has been determined by extrapolating the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the year end with changes in key assumptions that might reasonably occur.
While the Schemes risk hedging strategy is aimed at a valuation basis, the Directors estimate that on an accounting basis it would significantly reduce the above impact on the defined benefit obligation.
In particular, an increase in assumption of life expectations by one year would benefit from an estimated increase of the value of the longevity swap by 100 million, reducing the net impact on the defined pension deficit to 10 million.
Further, the ITV Pension Scheme invests in UK Government bonds and interest rate and inflation swap contracts and therefore movements in the defined benefit obligation are typically offset, to an extent, by asset movements.
1 159 59 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued What was the impact of movements on the Schemes assets and liabilities?
Keeping The sections above describe how the Scheme obligations and assets are comprised it simple and measured.
The following section sets out the impact of various movements and expenses on the Scheme on the Groups financial statements.
Amounts recognised through the income statement Amounts recognised through the income statement are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Amount charged to operating costs: Current service cost 2 7 Scheme administration expenses 5 5 7 12 Amount charged to net financing costs: Net interest on defined benefit obligation 9 5 Amount charged to exceptional costs: Curtailment cost 19 Total charged in the consolidated income statement 16 36 Amounts recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income The amounts recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income cost are: 2017 2016 m m Remeasurement gains losses : Return on scheme assets excluding interest income 51 416 Actuarial gains losses on liabilities arising from change in: experience adjustments 138 31 financial assumptions 12 868 demographic assumptions 29 173 121 664 Total recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 172 248 The 121 million actuarial gain on the Schemes liabilities was principally due to an experience gain of 138 million based on the use of updated membership data underlying the Trustees triennial valuation as at 1 January 2017.
The true-up of the membership data has resulted in a decrease in the liabilities.
The 51 million gain on the Schemes assets primarily results from increases in the market values of return-seeking investments, which has led to assets outperforming expectations.
160 160 ITV ITV p plc lc A A nnual nnua Repo l Reprt orand t and A Acco ccunts ount2017 s 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities Addressing the defined benefit pension deficit The Group works closely with the Trustee to agree appropriate levels of funding Keeping for the Scheme.
This involves agreeing a Schedule of Contributions at each triennial it simple valuation, which specifies the contribution rates for the employer and, where relevant, scheme members and the date these contributions are due.
A recovery plan setting out the steps that will be taken to address a funding shortfall is also agreed.
In the event that the Groups defined benefit scheme is in a net liability position, the Directors must take steps to manage the size of the deficit.
Apart from the funding agreements mentioned above, this could involve pledging additional assets to the Scheme, as was the case in the SDN and London Television Centre pension funding partnerships.
The levels of ongoing contributions to the Scheme are based on the current service costs as assessed by the Scheme Trustee and the expected future cash flows of the Scheme.
Normal employer contributions in 2018 for UTV Scheme current service and administration expenses are expected to be in the region of 5 million 2017: 6 million and deficit funding contributions for the main ITV scheme in 2018 are expected to be 66 million 2017: 66 million, assuming current contribution rates continue as agreed with the Trustee.
The Group has two asset-backed pension funding agreements with the Trustee and makes annual payments of 11 million for 12 years from 2011 and 2.5 million, increasing by 5% per annum until 2038.
In 2018, a payment of 14 million is expected as a result of those agreements.
IFRIC 14 clarifies how the asset ceiling rules should be applied if the Schemes are expected to be in surplus, for example as a result of deficit funding agreements.
The Group has determined that it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus assets if the Schemes are run off until the last member dies.
On this basis, IFRIC 14 rules do not cause any change in the pension deficit accounting or disclosures.

section The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV, specifically how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
Maintaining capital discipline and balance sheet efficiency remains important to the Group.
Any potential courses of action will take into account the Groups liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in the business, pension deficit initiatives and impact on credit ratings.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results and do so in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to invest in opportunities to grow the business and enhance shareholder value.
A Tax and Treasury committee acting under delegated authority from the Board, approves certain financial transactions and monitors compliance with the Groups tax and treasury policies.
Net cash debt is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total cash resources Keeping 4.1 net of the current outstanding debt.

Loans and facilities due within one year At various periods during the year, the Group drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility RCF to meet short-term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had drawings of 60 million under the RCF 2016: nil.
The maximum draw down of the RCF during the year was 390 million 2016: 500 million.
The Group also had an unsecured 161 million Eurobond that matured in January 2017 and had a coupon of 6.125%.
Loans and loan notes due after one year In 2016, the Group had a 100 million bilateral loan facility, which was repaid in full in June 2017.
The Group has issued the following Eurobonds: A seven-year 600 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.125%, which matures in September 2022: and A seven-year 500 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.0%, which will mature in December 2023.

Credit risk: the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations: and Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group is required to disclose the fair value of its debt instruments.
The fair value is the amount the Group would pay a third party to transfer the liability.
It is sourced in the capital markets.
This estimation of fair value is consistent with instruments valued under level 1 in note 4.5.
Accounting policies Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Under the amortised cost method, the difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recorded in the income statement over the period of the borrowing on an effective interest rate basis.
Finance leases Historically, ITV has entered into sale and leaseback agreements in relation to certain programme titles.
Related outstanding sale and leaseback obligations, which comprise the principal and accrued interest, are included within borrowings.
The finance-related element of the agreement is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on an effective interest basis.
Sale and leaseback obligations are secured against an equivalent cash balance held within cash and cash equivalents.
Managing credit and liquidity risk Credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of derivative financial assets see note 4.3, trade receivables see note 3.1.
3, and cash and cash equivalents see note 4.1.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The majority of trade receivables relate to airtime sales contracts with advertising agencies and advertisers.
Credit insurance has been taken out against these companies to minimise the impact on the Group in the event of a possible default.
The Group also reviews other significant receivables and will seek to take out credit insurance on an individual basis where appropriate.
In 2016, the Group signed a 100 million non-recourse receivables purchase agreement.
As at 31 December 2017, 10 million was available under the agreement 2016: 65 million.
The receivables in relation to the invoices sold were derecognised and the Group collects cash on behalf of the counterparty as payments fall due.
Cash The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash that emphasise preservation of capital.
The guidelines set out procedures and limits on counterparty risk and maturity profile of cash placed.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies.
Deposits longer than 12 months require the approval of the Board.

ITVs credit ratings, the cost of credit default swap hedging and the absolute level of interest rates are key determinants in the cost of new borrowings for ITV.
Liquidity risk The Groups financing policy is to fund itself for the medium to long-term by using debt instruments with a range of maturities and to ensure access to appropriate short-term borrowing facilities with a minimum of 250 million of undrawn facilities available at all times.
Long-term funding comes from the UK and European capital markets, while any short to medium-term debt requirements are provided through bank credit facilities totalling 930 million see below.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn bank facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This monitoring includes financial ratios to assess any possible future impact on credit ratings and headroom and takes into account the accessibility of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group has a 630 million Revolving Credit Facility with a group of relationship banks.
This facility, which was amended and extended in December 2016, matures in 2022 and is committed with leverage and interest cover financial covenants.

Keeping 4.3 A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk.
it simple Managing A derivatives value changes over time in response to underlying variables such market risks: as exchange rates or interest rates and is entered into for a fixed period.
A hedge derivative is where a derivative is used to manage exposure in an underlying variable.
financial The Group is exposed to certain market risks.
In accordance with Board-approved instruments policies, which are set out in this note, the Group manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the underlying exposures.
The key market risks facing the Group are: Currency risk arising from: i.
Translation risk, that is the risk in the period of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency profits, assets and liabilities balance sheet risk and non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities income statement risk : and ii.
Transaction risk, that is the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups non-functional currency trading cash flows.
A non-functional currency transaction is a transaction in any currency other than the reporting currency of the subsidiary.
Interest rate risk to the Group arises from significant changes in interest rates on borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates.
The Group mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when managing its currency and interest rate risk: Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge income statement translation risk arising from short-term intercompany loans denominated in a foreign currency: Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date: and Cross-currency interest rate swaps are derivative instruments used to exchange the principal and interest coupons in a debt instrument from one currency to another.
Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values are detailed in this section.
Accounting policies Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the income statement, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
In this case, the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassified to the income statement in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is realised.
Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and our current creditworthiness, as well as that of our swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The valuation techniques use inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations between inputs.
How do we manage our currency and interest rate risk?
Currency risk As the Group expands its international operations, the performance of the business becomes increasingly sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge material non-functional currency denominated costs or revenue for up to five years forward.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency denominated cash balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into sterling or by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary.
The Group also utilises foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps both to manage foreign currency cash flow timing differences and to hedge foreign currency denominated monetary items.
The Groups net investments in overseas subsidiaries may be hedged where the currency exposure is considered to be material.
The Group designated a portion of its euro borrowings into a net investment hedge against its euro denominated assets following the acquisition of Talpa Media.
The following table highlights the Groups sensitivity to translation risk resulting from a 10% strengthening weakening in sterling against the US dollar and euro, assuming all other variables are held constant: 2017 post- 2016 posttax profit 2017 equity tax profit 2016 equity US dollar 1 million 23 million 3 million 32 million Euro 3 million 17 million 10 million 11 million The Groups sensitivity to translation risk for revenue and adjusted EBITA is disclosed in the Finance Review on page 47.
The key difference between the foreign currency sensitivity for adjusted EBITA and profit after tax is the impact on the US dollar and euro denominated exceptional costs, including acquisition-related costs, acquired intangible amortisation and net financing cost.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate policy is to allow fixed rate gross debt to vary between 20% and 100% of total gross debt to accommodate floating rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
At 31 December 2017, the Groups fixed rate debt represented 92% of total gross debt 2016: 92%.
Consequently, a 1% movement in interest rates on floating rate debt would impact the 2017 post-tax profit for the year by less than 1 million 2016: 2 million.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss, the movements in the year relating to changes in fair value and interest are not separated.

In order to fix the sterling cash outflows associated with the commitments and interest payments which are mainly denominated in AUD or euros the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps for the same foreign currency amount and maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow.
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income during the period all relates to the effective portion of the revaluation loss associated with these contracts.
There was less than 1 million 2016: 1 million ineffectiveness taken to the income statement and 20 million cumulative gain 2016: 5 million gain recycled to the income statement in the year.
On issuing the 2023 Eurobond, the Group entered into a portfolio of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which swapped the euro principal and fixed rate coupons into sterling.
As a result, the Group makes sterling interest payments at a fixed rate.
Net investment hedges The Group uses euro denominated debt to partially hedge against the change in the sterling value of its euro denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of debt in a net investment hedge was 177 million 2016: 168 million.
A foreign exchange loss of 6 million 2016: 21 million relating to the net investment hedges has been netted off within exchange differences on translation of foreign operations as presented on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

costs In reporting adjusted profit, the Group adjusts net financing costs to exclude unrealised mark-to-market movements on interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, gains losses on bond buy-backs, net pension interest, interest and fair value movements in acquisition-related liabilities and other financing costs.
Our rationale for adjustments made to financing costs is set out in the Finance Review.
Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest income on funds invested, gains losses on the disposal of financial instruments, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, interest expense on borrowings and finance leases, unwinding of the discount on provisions, unwinding of the discount on liabilities to non-controlling interest, foreign exchange gains losses, and imputed interest on pension assets and liabilities.
Interest income and expense is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Net financing costs Net financing costs can be analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Financing income: Interest income 4 2 4 2 Financing costs: Interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 30 25 Net pension interest see note 3.7 9 5 Change in fair value of instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss 1 Foreign exchange loss 3 8 Other finance expense 12 14 54 53 Net financing costs 50 51 Interest on financial liabilities relates to the interest incurred on the Groups borrowings in the year.
Other finance expense includes the amortisation of facility commitment and upfront fees as well as movements in the estimated value of acquisition-related contingent liabilities, which contributed to most of the 2017 expense.
This is where estimates of the future performance against stretch targets is reassessed, resulting in adjustments to the related put option liabilities.

The measurement of this fair it simple Fair value value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the hierarchy calculations.
ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market values e. g. external share prices.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below.
Level 1 Fair values are measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Fair values are measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for at the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the reporting date.
Level 3 Fair values are measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

17 173 3 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs continued The Group utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration Keeping 4.7 packages, and therefore operates a number of share-based compensation schemes, it simple Share-based namely the Deferred Share Award DSA, Performance Share Plan PSP, Long Term compensation Incentive Plan LTIP and Save As You Earn SAYE schemes.
The share-based compensation is not pensionable.
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Group receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
If the Group incurs a liability linked to the price or value of the Groups shares, this will also fall under a share-based transaction.
A description of each type of share-based payment arrangement that existed at any time during the period is set out in the Annual Remuneration Report.
Accounting policies For each of the Groups share-based compensation schemes, the fair value of the equity instrument granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for the SAYE scheme, a BlackScholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions.
For performance-based schemes, the relevant Group performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order to determine the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate is then used to determine the option fair value, discounted to present value.
The Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares.
No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA.

assets and liabilities Contingent assets In 2017 Talpa Media took back the licence for The Voice of China due a breach of the agreement by the customer, Talent, for not fulfilling their payment obligations.
Whilst the Directors are confident of recovering the amount due, accounting standards set very specific requirements for the recognition of contingent assets, which is how the recovery of the amount due has been accounted for.
As discussions with the insurers and the claim against Talent are still in progress, at this early stage of pursuing recovery the Group is not able to demonstrate sufficient certainty to be able to recognise a cash receivable at the year end.
See note 2.2 for further details.
Contingent liabilities The Group has initiated legal proceedings against the minority owners of Gurney Productions LLC for alleged breaches of contracts and their fiduciary duties, as well as self-dealing and fraudulent concealment.
The minority owners dispute the allegations and they have counter-claimed for damages of at least $150 million.
The action is ongoing and, having taken legal advice, the Directors believe this counter-claim is completely without merit.
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in respect of warranties given in connection with certain disposals of businesses.
None of these items are expected to have a material effect on the Groups results or financial position.
