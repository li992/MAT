The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise securities in unlisted and listed companies, partnership interests, trade receivables, trade payables, money market funds and cash.
The main risks arising from the Groups and Companys financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, credit, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
The financial risks of the Company are aligned to the Groups financial risks.
Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
38 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 19 Financial Instruments continued The Group is exposed to the risk of the change in value of its fund investments, listed and unlisted equity, non-equity shares, fixed and floating rate securities.
For listed investments, the market risk variable is deemed to be the price itself.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these prices, is set out in part ii of this Note.
For unlisted equity and non-equity shares the market risk is deemed to be the price earnings ratio or other appropriate valuation methodology as set out in the accounting policy.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these variables, is set out in part vi of this note.
Foreign Currency Risk The Groups total return and net assets are affected by foreign exchange translation movements as a proportion of the investments held are denominated in or impacted by currencies other than sterling.
The foreign investments held are principally held in the USA and Continental Europe.
The Board monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies on a regular basis and assesses the risks by considering the effect of currency movements on the Groups NAV and income.
The impact on profit after tax and on shareholders equity due to increases and decreases in the value of the US Dollar and Euro, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are analysed in part iii of this note.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including realised capital profits.
These profits are held as cash balances to the extent they have not been distributed.
The Company had no gearing at 30th September 2017.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities and the impact of the profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity due to increases or decreases in interest rates, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are shown in part iv of this note.
These profiles exclude short-term receivables and payables.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares, fixed income securities, liquidity funds and secondaries.
Whilst unlisted equity is illiquid, short-term flexibility is achieved through cash which is available on demand and liquidity funds which are available within 24 hours.
Credit Risk The Groups exposure to credit risk principally arises from its cash deposits.
Only major banks with market capitalisation above 20 billion are used when making cash deposits and the level of cash is reviewed on a regular basis.
Cash was principally held with two UK banks see table below and totalled 54 million 2016: 659 million.

In doing so the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders whilst remaining within the restrictions imposed by its investment trust status or issue new shares or debt.
During the year the Group paid dividends totalling 1,394 million 2016: 49 million.
The Group manages the levels of cash deposits held whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity for investments.
The Group has an existing authority to implement an on-market share buy-back programme to generate shareholder value.
During the year 94 million, including transaction fees, 2016: nil were utilised to repurchase shares for cancellation.
ii Market Price Exposure The table below shows the Groups exposure to market price risks.
In determining a reasonable possible price movement, the Group observed historical price changes on a bi-annual frequency over the preceding 10-year period.

iii Foreign Currency Exposures The table below shows the Groups exposure to foreign currency risks.
In determining reasonably possible currency movements, the Group analysed observable market rates for Euro and US Dollar for the preceding ten-year period.

The financial instruments shown below are separated into the type of income they generated as at 30th September 2017.
Base interest rate in the UK has been close to 0% for a number of years and for the purpose of sensitivity analysis, the Group analysed a 1% rate change scenario, which is considered to be a reasonable movement in light of the recent rise in benchmark interest rate.

The carrying values of the financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are equal to the fair value.
The unlisted financial assets held at fair value are valued in accordance with the Principles of Valuation of Unlisted Equity Investments as detailed within the Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies Note 24.
42 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 19 Financial Instruments continued vi Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The Group complies with IFRS 13 in respect of disclosures about the degree of reliability of fair value measurements.
This requires the Group to classify, for disclosure purposes, fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for which any significant input to the valuation is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Directors.
The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
The following tables represent the Groups and Companys assets by hierarchy levels, and all fair value measurements disclosed are recurring fair value measurements.

The Group does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments.
Investments classified within Level 1 are liquidity funds and a listed investment.
Financial instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within Level 2.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 43 Further Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic and Business Review 19 Financial Instruments continued Investments classified within Level 3 make use of significant unobservable inputs in deriving fair value, as they trade infrequently.
As observable prices are not available for these securities, the Group has used valuation techniques to derive the fair value.
Investments classified within Level 3 consist of private equity direct investments and fund and secondary positions.
The main inputs into the Groups valuation models for private equity investments are EBITDA multiples based on the budgeted EBITDA or most recent EBITDA achieved or a rolling 12 months basis of the issuer and equivalent corresponding EBITDA multiples of comparable listed companies, quality of earnings assessments, assessments of third party external debt, comparability difference adjustments, cost of capital adjustments and probabilities of default.
The Group also considers the original transaction prices, recent transactions in the same or similar instruments and completed third-party transactions in comparable companies instruments and adjusts the model as deemed necessary.
In determining the valuation for the Groups equity instruments, comparable trading multiples are used in arriving at the valuation for private equity.
In accordance with the Groups policy, appropriate comparable public companies based on industry, size, developmental stage, revenue generation and strategy are determined and a trading multiple for each comparable company identified is then calculated.
The multiple is calculated by dividing the enterprise value of the comparable group by its EBITDA.
The trading multiple is then adjusted for considerations such as illiquidity, marketability and other differences, advantages and disadvantages between the Groups portfolio company and the comparable public companies based on company specific facts and circumstances.
The value of private equity funds is primarily based on the latest available financial capital account statement of the private equity fund.
The Company may make adjustments to the value as set out in Note 24.
As at 30th September 2017, 8% 2016: 10% of financial assets at fair value comprise of investments in private equity funds that have been valued in accordance with the policies set out in Note 24.
The private equity funds are not publicly traded and prior to maturity an exit can only be made by the Company through a sale of its investment and commitment through a secondary market.
The carrying values of the private equity funds may be significantly different from the values ultimately realised on an exit via a secondary market sale.
The following tables present the movement of assets measured at fair value, based on fair value measurement levels.

48 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 21 Share Based Payments During the year, a new Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in compensation to the executives of the Group.
The LTIP is an equity settled share based payment scheme.
However, awards can be settled in cash equivalents at the discretion of the Group Remuneration Committee.
For the purpose of classification, the share based payment scheme is recognised as equity settled on the basis that the Group has no present obligation for settling awards in cash, contractually or constructively i. e. past practices.
The cost of share based payment is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in share based payment reserves.
Expenses are borne by the Group and recognised over the period in which vesting conditions are fulfilled.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
The total charge in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year was 44,482 2016: nil.
Details of the share based payment scheme are as follows: Grant Date 13th July 2017 Number of shares granted 47,783 Market Price on Grant Date 795,102 Performance period 3 years 1.
Continued services over the vesting period.
The Groups TSR performance relative to that of a comparator group of companies, comprised of the constituents of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts over the vesting period.
Vesting percentage of the award are as follows: Vesting conditions TSR against comparator group over Percentage of award that vests performance period Below median 0% Median 20% Between median and upper quartile Between 20% and 100% straight-line Upper quartile or more 100% Change in corporate control All unvested awards shall vest on date of such event.
and other corporate events Settlement method Equity settled, with option of cash alternative determined by the Group Remuneration Committee.
The Directors consider that the market value of shares at grant date materially reflects the variable inputs in the fair valuation of the nil-cost options granted.
Assumptions that may result in changes to the share based payment expense and reserves in the Group Financial Statements will be reassessed at all future reporting dates.

Details of transactions between the Group and Company and other related parties are disclosed below.
Termination Payment On 26th May 2016, the Company served notice of termination of the Management and Investment Guideline Agreement on Epiris effective on 31st May 2017.
Under the terms of their contract, Epiris were paid 34 million compensation based on the Priority Profit Share received in the year to 31st May 2017.
32 million was recognised during the year ended 30th September 2016 with the remaining 2 million being recognised during the current year.
Carried interest schemes Certain members of Epiris the participants are entitled to benefit from carried interest schemes under the terms of the limited partnerships through which Electra invests.
Details of these schemes are as follows: Long Term Incentive Scheme LTI Under this scheme participants invested in every new investment made by Electra between 1995 and March 2006.
In return, the participants are entitled to a percentage of the total capital and revenue profits made on each such investment.
The participants do not receive any profit until Electra has received back its initial investment.
1995 LTI Participants are entitled to a percentage of the incremental value of unlisted investments held at 31st March 1995, subject to Electra having received total proceeds equal to the valuation of those investments as at 31st March 1995 plus a preferred return.
The Initial Pool This relates to a pool of investments valued at 160 million at 31st March 2006 the initial pool.
Under this arrangement participants are entitled to 10% the carried interest of the aggregate realised profits of the initial pool.
The realised profits are calculated as being the aggregate of income and sale proceeds received by Electra less the 160 million opening value, less any additional purchases and less Priority Profit Share.
Carried interest is payable only once realised profits exceed a preferred return of 15% compounded annually on the opening value of the initial pool plus the cost of further investments less realisations.
A full catch-up is payable once the realised profits of the initial pool exceed the preferred return.
This catch-up means that all proceeds above the cumulative preferred return accrue to participants until they have been paid an amount equating to 10% of the total realised profits of the initial pool.
Thereafter proceeds are split 90%:10% between Electra and the participants.
2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015 Pools In October 2006, new arrangements were entered into in respect of investments made over each consecutive 3 year period.
At the reporting date, such arrangements are in operation in relation to the 3 year periods from 2006 to 2009, 2009 to 2012, 2012 to 2015 and 2015 to 2018 investments being made in each such period being referred to as a pool.
Under these arrangements participants are entitled to a carried interest of 18% of the aggregate realised profits in relation to direct investments in each pool.
The realised profits are calculated as being the aggregate of income and sale proceeds received by Electra less the purchase costs of investments and less Priority Profit Share.
Carried interest is payable only once realised profits exceed a preferred return of 8% compounded annually on the cost of investments less realisations.
A full catch-up is payable once the realised profits exceed the preferred return.
This catch-up means that all proceeds above the cumulative preferred return accrue to participants until they have been paid an amount equating to 18% of the total realised profits.
Thereafter proceeds are split 82%:18% between Electra and the participants.
Similar arrangements are in place for indirect investments, the difference from the above arrangements being that the carried interest is 9% over an 8% preferred return.
No Directors of Electra participate in the above schemes.

Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 55 Further Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic and Business Review 23 Related Party Transactions continued Electra Partners Club 2007 LP co-investment agreement In November 2007, Electra entered into a co-investment agreement with Electra Partners Club 2007 LP Club, a fund managed by Epiris Managers LLP.
The co-investment agreement required Electra to co-invest at the ratio of 2:1 in all Epiris investments in private equity opportunities in Western Europe where the combined investment of Electra and the Club would represent a controlling stake and where the combined equity investment is between 25 million to 75 million.
Both parties invested on the same terms and conditions.
The agreement allowed for variations to these arrangements in certain prescribed circumstances, for example, where investment would compromise Electras ability to qualify as an Investment Trust or where the Club would exceed certain concentration ratios.
Investments that arise from interests that Electra already held prior to the establishment of the Club are unaffected by these sharing arrangements.
These arrangements expired in May 2013.
Priority Profit Share Priority Profit Share for the year ended 30th September 2017 was 23 million 2016: 29 million.

These fees are accounted for within the investment income line in the Financial Statements.
Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements, Epiris is entitled to receive 50% of the aggregate deal fees in excess of abort costs which were nil 2016: 2 million.
This is achieved by increasing the Priority Profit Share for the year by the relevant amount.
These amounts are shown in the table above.

Electra remunerates G10 by way of a fixed monthly fee for providing full scope AIFM services, a further fixed monthly fee for each subsidiary entity which requires manager and operator services and at agreed hourly rates for any other services provided.
The AIFM and its staff receive no remuneration through profit share, carried interest, co-investment or other schemes related to Electras performance.
G10 has reviewed its remuneration policies and procedures to ensure incentives are aligned with the requirements of AIFMD.

24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies The Group Financial Statements for the year ended 30th September 2017 have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
IFRS comprises standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC as adopted in the European Union as at 30th September 2017.
In order to reflect the activities of an investment trust company, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated Income Statement.
In analysing total income between capital and revenue returns, the Directors have followed the guidance contained in the Statement of Recommended Practice for investment companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies in November 2014 the SORP.
The recommendations of the SORP which have been followed include: Realised and unrealised profits or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments classified as held at fair value through profit or loss should be shown in the capital column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
Realised gains are taken to the realised reserves in equity and unrealised gains are transferred to the unrealised reserves in equity Returns on any share or debt security whether in respect of dividends, interest or otherwise should be shown in the revenue column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
The total of the revenue column of the Consolidated Income Statement is taken to the revenue reserve in equity The Board should determine whether the indirect costs of generating capital gains should also be shown in the capital column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
If the Board decides that this should be so, the management fee should be allocated between revenue and capital in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, and other expenses should be charged to capital only to the extent that a clear connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments can be demonstrated.
The Board has decided that the Company should continue to charge Priority Profit Share as revenue item for the year ended 30th September 2017 The separate Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and accordingly has not presented a separate Company Income Statement.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of FRS 101 and the following exemptions have been applied: Cash Flow Statement and related notes Related party disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group settled share based payment schemes Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 57 Further Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic and Business Review 24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of certain assets at fair value, as disclosed in the Principles of Valuation of Investments.
Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Where subsidiaries are acquired or sold during the year their results are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition and up to the date of disposal respectively.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control, as defined by IFRS 10, is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The amendments to IFRS 10 and 12 define an investment entity and include an exception from the consolidation requirements for investment entities.
The Company has been deemed to meet the definition of an investment entity per IFRS 10 as the following conditions exist: The Company has multiple unrelated investors which are not related parties, and holds multiple investments Ownership interests in the Company are exposed to variable returns from changes in the fair value of the Companys net assets The Company has obtained funds for the purpose of providing investors with investment management services The Companys business purpose is investing solely for returns from capital appreciation and investment income The performance of investments is measured and evaluated on a fair value basis Electra Private Equity PLC does not consolidate the portfolio companies it controls.
The principal subsidiaries comprise wholly owned companies and near wholly owned investment holding limited partnerships.
They provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice and hold investments in managed assets.
The primary purpose of these entities is to provide investment related services that relate to the Companys investment activities and therefore they are not considered to be investment entities.
These subsidiaries continue to be consolidated.
Application of New Standards The following new IFRSs have been issued by the IASB, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018.
The Group has not early adopted these standards for the year ended 30th September 2017, however full impact assessments on IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers have been completed.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Financial assets within the Group are measured either at fair value or amortised cost.
Those measured at amortised cost are held wholly for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and so will remain valued in this way.
Therefore the new requirements on initial recognition and subsequent measurement of financial assets under IFRS 9 are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
There are currently no hedging arrangements in the Group.
Therefore requirements on hedging and hedge accounting under IFRS 9 is considered to be not applicable.
Should hedging arrangements be put in place in future, the provisions of IFRS 9 will be considered.
As at 30th September 2017, the Group held a loans and receivables balance of 1 million in total.
The Group will implement a 12-month expected credit loss model on adoption of IFRS 9.
This is not expected to be materially different to the current incurred credit loss model.
58 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The main revenue generating assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and will be within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments when it becomes effective.
On this basis, the Groups main revenue stream will be outside the scope of IFRS 15.
Sundry revenue generated by the Group during 2017 amounted to less than 0.2million and is expected to stay at similar levels in future periods.
IFRS 16 Leases An impact assessment of IFRS 16 is ongoing and the Group will publish the results of the assessment and details of implementation in the Financial Statements for the year ending 30th September 2018.
While there will be an impact of implementing this standard, this is not expected to be material.
The following amended standards became effective for accounting period commencing on or after 1st January 2017 and will be adopted by the Group from 1st October 2017.
No material impact is expected on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group following the adoption.
IFRS 2 amendments Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions IAS 7 amendments Disclosure Initiative IAS 12 amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture Investments Purchases and sales of listed investments are recognised on the trade date where a contract exists whose terms require delivery within a time frame determined by the relevant market.
Purchases and sales of unlisted investments are recognised when the contract for acquisition or sale becomes unconditional.
Investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss described in the Financial Statements as investments held at fair value and are subsequently measured at reporting dates at fair value.
The fair value of direct unquoted investments is calculated in accordance with the Principles of Valuation of Investments below.
Principles of Valuation of Investments On 26th May 2016 the Company served notice of termination of the Management and Investment Guideline Agreement on Epiris effective on 31st May 2017, and appointed G10 Capital Limited G10 as its AIFM as at 1st June 2017. i General The Group estimates the fair value of each investment at the reporting date in accordance with IFRS 13 and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation IPEV Guidelines.
Fair value is the price for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
In estimating fair value, the Manager applies a valuation technique which is appropriate in light of the nature, facts and circumstances of the investment and uses reasonable current market data and inputs combined with judgement and assumptions.
Valuation techniques are applied consistently from one reporting date to another except where a change in technique results in a better estimate of fair value.
The Group tests its valuation techniques using a tool known as calibration.
This compares the inputs and assumptions used in estimating fair value on the reporting date to those used on previous reporting dates and to those underlying the initial entry price of an investment in order to ensure that the inputs and assumptions used on the reporting date are consistent with those used previously.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 59 Further Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic and Business Review 24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued In general, the Group will determine the enterprise value of the investee company in question using one of a range of valuation techniques: adjust the enterprise value for factors that would normally be taken into account such as surplus assets, excess liabilities or other contingencies or relevant factors: and apportion the resulting amount between the investee companys relevant financial instruments according to their ranking and taking into account the effect of any instrument that may dilute the economic entitlement of a given instrument.
ii Unlisted Equity Investments In respect of each unlisted investment the Group selects one or more of the following valuation techniques: A market approach, based on the price of the recent investment, earnings multiples or industry valuation benchmarks An income approach, employing a discounted cash flow technique A replacement cost approach valuing the net assets of the portfolio company In assessing whether a methodology is appropriate the Group maximises the use of techniques that draw heavily on observable market-based measures of risk and return.
Price of Recent Investment Where the investment being valued was itself made recently, its cost may provide a good indication of fair value.
Using the Price of Recent Investment technique is not a default and at each reporting date the fair value of recent investments is estimated to assess whether changes or events subsequent to the relevant transaction would imply a change in the investments fair value.
Multiple Typically the Group uses an earnings multiple technique.
This involves the application of an appropriate and reasonable multiple to the maintainable earnings of an investee company.
The Group usually derives a multiple by reference to current market-based multiples, reflected in the market valuations of quoted comparable companies or the price at which comparable companies have changed ownership.
Differences between these market-based multiples and the investee company being valued are reflected by adjusting the multiple for points of difference which might affect the risk and earnings growth prospects which underpin the earnings multiple.
Such points of difference might include the relative size and diversity of the entities, rate of earnings growth, reliance on a small number of key employees, diversity of product ranges, diversity and quality of customer base, level of borrowing, and any other reason the quality of earnings may differ.
In respect of maintainable earnings, the Group usually uses earnings for the most recent 12 month period adjusted if necessary to represent a reasonable estimate of maintainable earnings.
Such adjustments might include exceptional or non-recurring items, the impact of discontinued activities and acquisitions, or forecast material changes in earnings.
In some circumstances the Group may apply a multiple to the net assets of a business, typically where the business value derives mainly from the underlying fair value of its assets rather than its earnings, such as property holding companies.
Discounted Cash Flow The Discounted Cash Flow technique involves deriving the value of a business or an investment by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows from that business or investment using reasonable assumptions and estimations of expected future cash flows, the terminal value or maturity amount and date, and the appropriate risk-adjusted rate that captures the risk inherent to the business or investment.
The Group usually uses the Discounted Cash Flow technique in respect of certain debt investments or where the realisation of an investment is imminent with the pricing of the relevant transaction being substantially agreed such that the technique is likely to be the most appropriate one.
60 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued iii Listed Investments The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and transactions for an asset take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an on-going basis.
The quoted market price used for listed financial instruments held by the Group is the bid price on the reporting date.
iv Fund Investments In determining the fair value of investments in funds the NAV of the fund as reported by the manager is used as the starting point.
The Group may make adjustments to the reported NAV to reflect, for example, purchases and sales occurring between the funds measurement date and the reporting date, or any other facts or circumstances which might impact the fair value of the fund.
v Money Market Liquidity funds are held at the current fair value of the note.
vi Subsidiary Undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company Balance Sheet at the fair value of the subsidiary.
vii Accrued Income Accrued income is included within investment valuations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than 3 months.
Foreign Currencies The Groups and Companys presentational and functional currency is Pounds Sterling Sterling, since that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Transactions in currencies other than Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currencies of the Groups respective entities at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency revenue and expenses are translated into the functional currencies of the Groups respective entities at the month end rate for the period the transaction occurred.
Exchange differences arising are recognised through the Consolidated Income Statement.
At each balance sheet date assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation of the equity and reserves of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than sterling, are recognised directly in the Translation Reserve in equity.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year.
Investment Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are accounted on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, are accounted when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield when it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the Group.
Where income accruals previously recognised, but not received, are no longer considered to be reasonably expected to be received, either through investee company restructuring or doubt over its receipt, then these amounts are reversed through expenses.
Income distributions from limited partnership funds are recognised when the right to distribution is established.
Other income Interest income received from money market funds are accounted for as the interest is accrued on an effective interest rate basis.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 61 Further Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic and Business Review 24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Expenses Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
Exceptional Expenses Exceptional expenses are those items that are material either because of their size or their nature and are presented within their relevant Consolidated Income Statement category, disclosed separately in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Lease Expense Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statements as an integral part of the total lease expense and are therefore also recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Defined Contribution Plan The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions.
Pension contributions are recognised as expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement, as incurred.
Finance Costs Costs of borrowings are expensed as revenue items through the Consolidated Income Statement as they accrue on an effective interest rate basis.
Any costs incurred which were not directly related to the borrowing facility are expensed in the revenue account.
Priority Profit Share The majority of the investments are made by the Group and Company through investment holding limited partnerships.
Under the terms of the relevant limited partnership agreements the general partner is entitled to appropriate, as a first charge on the net income or net capital gains of the limited partnerships, an amount equivalent to its Priority Profit Share.
In years in which the investment holding limited partnerships have not yet earned sufficient net income or net capital gain to satisfy this Priority Profit Share the entitlement is carried forward to the following year.
In all instances, the cash amount paid to the general partner in each year is equivalent to the Priority Profit Share.
The Priority Profit Share is charged wholly to the revenue column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
Taxation The tax effect of different items of income gain and expense loss is allocated between capital and revenue on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates, using the Companys effective rate of tax for the accounting year.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
62 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting year, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Zero Dividend Preference Shares Zero Dividend Preference Shares which exhibit the characteristics of debt were recognised as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 32.
After initial recognition, these liabilities were measured at amortised cost, which represented the initial net proceeds from the issuance after issue costs plus the accrued entitlement to the balance sheet date.
The accrued entitlement was calculated as the difference between the proceeds on the issue of these shares and the redemption amount at maturity and was charged as interest expense over the life of these shares using the effective interest method.
In accordance with the Association of Investment Companies AIC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP this interest expense was allocated to the capital column of the Consolidated Income Statement.
Convertible Bonds The Bond, in accordance with IFRS, was treated as a compound financial instrument that contained both a liability and an equity component.
The economic effect of issuing the instrument was substantially the same as issuing both a debt instrument with an obligation to make payment of interest and principal assuming it was not converted and an equity instrument a written call option granting the holder the right for a specified period of time to convert into a fixed number of ordinary shares.
The proceeds from issuing Convertible Bonds were split on Electras Consolidated Balance Sheet into its constituent parts of debt and equity in accordance with the requirement of IFRS.
Finance costs were taken to the Consolidated Income Statement and were calculated as the yield to maturity of the fair value of the debt component of the Bond.
On conversion, the value of the Bonds converted was debited to long-term liabilities.
The nominal value of the ordinary shares issued on conversion was credited to share capital and the balance representing the excess of conversion proceeds over nominal value of the shares was credited to the share premium account.
On conversion, the fair value of the equity element was credited to the revenue reserve and debited to other reserves.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 63 Further Information Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic and Business Review 24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made.
The provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Changes in provisions are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The provision for the incentive schemes is based on the valuation of investments as at the balance sheet date.
The incentive scheme is charged to the capital column of the Consolidated Income Statement as a direct cost.
Revenue and Capital Reserves Net Capital return is added to the Capital Reserve in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, while the net revenue return is added to the Revenue Reserve.
Receivables and Payables Receivables and payables are typically settled in a short time frame and are carried at the amount due to be settled.
As a result, the fair value of these balances is considered to be materially equal to the carrying value, after taking into account potential impairment losses.
Share Capital Ordinary shares issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds or fair value received with the excess of the amount received over nominal value being credited to the share premium account.
Direct issue costs net of tax are deducted from equity.
Share Based Payments Some employees have been granted nil value options in the Company.
In the Consolidated Financial Statements the fair value of the shares acquired is recognised as an employee expense with corresponding increase in equity in accordance with IFRS 2.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the fair value of the shares.
Where vesting is conditional upon a market condition being met, the scheme is treated as vesting irrespective of market conditions being met, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
Going Concern The Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty used in preparing the financial information are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable.
The resulting judgements and estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
In the course of preparing the Financial Statements, no judgements have been made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, other than those involving estimations that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
64 Electra Private Equity PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty in the reporting year, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Sensitivity analysis on key sources of estimation has been disclosed in Note 19.
Fair value measurements and valuation processes Unquoted assets are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 and the IPEV Guidelines for financial reporting purposes.
Judgement is required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology and subsequently in determining the inputs into the valuation model used.
These judgements include making assessments of the future earnings potential of portfolio companies, appropriate earnings multiples to apply, and adjustments to comparable multiples.
The Board of Directors of the Company has set up a Valuations Committee, which is chaired by a Non-Executive Director, to determine the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurements.
In estimating the fair value of an asset, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available.
Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group uses internal experts to perform the valuation.
The Valuations Committee works closely with the internal expert and G10 Capital Limited to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model.
The Chairman of the Valuations Committee reports its findings to the Board of Directors of the Group every 6 months to explain the cause of fluctuations in the fair value of the assets and liabilities.
Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets and liabilities are disclosed on pages 59 to 61.
