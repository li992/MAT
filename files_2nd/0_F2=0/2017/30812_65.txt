The principal restructuring activities in 2017 and 2016 are as described in note 3 e. While some elements of the non-current provisions of 71 million will unwind over several years, as termination payments are made over extended periods in some countries, it is estimated that approximately 35% will unwind within five years.
Employee related benefits mainly relate to employee benefits other than post-employment benefits.
The principal components of these provisions are gratuity and termination awards, and jubilee payments due after a certain service period.
It is estimated that approximately 22% of the non-current provisions of 16 million will unwind within five years.
A provision of 274 million was made in 2011 for a potential claim under a 1998 settlement agreement entered into by a Group subsidiary in respect of the clean-up of sediment in the Fox River.
On 30 September 2014, the Group, NCR, Appvion and Windward Prospects entered into a funding agreement: the details of this agreement are explained in note 28.
This agreement led to payments of 18 million in 2017 2016: 6 million.
In addition, the Group incurred legal costs of 7 million 2016: 11 million, which were also charged against the provision.
In light of the conclusion of the funding agreement, the sums that the Group agreed to pay thereunder, as well as the available information in relation to the extent of the clean-up related costs, the Group reviewed the Fox River provision and increased the provision by 20 million in 2016 owing to the significant devaluation of the GBP against the USD.
It is expected that the non-current provision will unwind within five years.
On 10 February 2017, a decision was delivered on the further hearing related to a payment of dividends by Windward to Sequana in May 2009.
Further details are provided in note 28.

Amounts provided above are shown net of reversals of unused provisions which include reversals of 7 million 2016: 41 million for restructuring of existing businesses, 5 million 2016: 2 million for employee benefits and 49 million 2016: 61 million for other provisions.
