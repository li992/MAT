UK deferred tax at the balance sheet date has been calculated at 17%.
Deferred tax in other territories has been calculated at enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when assets are realised or liabilities are settled.
As a result of US tax reform, US deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017 have been calculated at 24% 2016: 38%.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

Overview Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 115 11 Tax continued Included within the tax reconciliation are a number of non-recurring items, principally non-tax deductible one-off costs which fluctuate from year to year and the recognition of Canadian deferred tax assets in 2017, which were not recognised in 2016.
In addition, a deferred tax asset is not recognised for certain expenses in our US business in 2017 and this will continue to be assessed annually.
The differences attributable to the UK CFC Controlled Foreign Company exemption, Patent Box and higher overseas tax rates are expected to recur in the future the level of profits in overseas jurisdictions and changes to the UK and overseas tax rates will affect the size of this difference in future.
The benefit of the CFC exemption is subject to an ongoing EU State Aid investigation into the UKs Controlled Foreign Company regime.
In October 2017 the European Commission issued a preliminary finding that the Group financing partial exemption is illegal State Aid.
In common with other UK-based international companies whose arrangements are in line with current UK CFC legislation we may be affected by the eventual outcome of the investigation and are monitoring developments.
No provision for this potential liability has been made in these financial statements as it is not clear what, if any, the eventual financial result will be.

The Groups , which represent Cash Generating Unit CGU groupings, are: Aerospace, Infrastructure, Nuclear, Communications, C2ISR, Maritime, Land and Underwater Warfare.
These represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent that operations, to which goodwill relates, are transferred between CGU groups.
The size of a CGU group varies but is never larger than a reportable operating segment.
There have been no changes in the year.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% 2016: 2.5% per annum.
Cash flows beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates, forecast gross margins, underlying operating profit and operating cash conversion.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2017 was 10.1% 2016: 10.1%.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historic experience, available government spending data, and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates.
Longer-term growth rates, applied for the ten-year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%.
Ultra considers the longterm growth rate to be appropriate for the sectors in which it operates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans, a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development and available markets.
A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultras products and expertise from a number of US government agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to: i reduce the post-2022 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil: ii apply a 20% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows: and iii consider specific market factors as noted above.

Overview Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 117 14 Goodwill continued Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to a potential impairment in Infrastructure.
Headroom, which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the Infrastructure value-in-use calculations, is 6.0m.
Sensitivity ii results in a 0.9m impairment in Infrastructure: the CGU grouping is sensitive to the ability of the remaining operations to win sufficient new customers over the medium term.
For all other CGUs, the value-in-use calculations exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 21 years Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Profit in acquired order book 1 to 3 years Other acquired 1 to 5 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Other intangibles: Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years Ultra AR 2017 Financal Ultra AR 2008 Financial copy.

The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counterparties and customers, the customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long-term business relationships.
The Group has a small number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding.
These customers are considered to have low credit risk.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, when appropriate, action is taken to minimise the Groups credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 22, net of any allowances for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

22 Financial instruments and financial risk management Derivative financial instruments Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of Ultras financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2 or Level 3.
Further details on the SADI loan, which is classified as Level 3, are set out in note 23.

Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
For most of the year there were two revolving credit facilities in place: the first facility, originally established in 2012 and amended in 2015, provided 100 million and was due to expire in August 2019 and the second facility, established in 2014, provided 200 million and was also due to expire in August 2019.
On 7 November 2017 these facilities were replaced with a new 300 million of revolving credit with an expiry date of November 2022.
The facility has the option to be extended, subject to lender consent, by a further two years to November 2024.
The facility also incorporates an uncommitted 150 million accordion.
The facility is denominated in Sterling, US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Euros and is used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A US$225m term-loan, which expires in August 2019, was put in place at the time of the Herley acquisition.
A 5 million overdraft, and US$10 million overdraft are available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 1.20% 2016: 1.35% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had available 300,000,000 2016: 213,000,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working capital requirements.
Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Groups committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems TCS, participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Further disclosure is provided in note 23.
The Group has a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. US$10m of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity date of July 2018 and a further US$60m of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 21, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollars and Canadian Dollars.
At 31 December 2017, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 11,863,000 2016: liability 23,847,000, comprising 2,462,000 assets 2016: 254,000 and 13,891,000 liabilities 2016: 24,101,000.
The gain on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 11,983,000 2016: loss 19,103,000.
The net notional or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.

The table above includes these forwards.
Net investment hedges At the year end, the Group had net investments in US companies where the associated foreign currency translation risk was hedged by external borrowings in US Dollars.
The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
The value of the net investment hedge was US$265m 2016: US$295m.
Interest rate risk The Group holds interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps mature in July 2019 and have a fixed swap rate, including the bank margin, of 1.232%.
The floating rates are US Dollar LIBOR.
At the year end, the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US$60m 2016: US$90m.
The hedging contracts fix US$60m of borrowings to 30 December 2017, reducing to US$45m by December 2018 and nil by July 2019.
Overview Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 123 22 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The interest rate swaps were designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value is charged to equity.
At 31 December 2017, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was 434,000 2016: 315,000.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was 27,000 and has been charged to interest cost in the year 2016: 495,000.
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next 1.5 years.
The Group also has US$70m of fixed rate debt with Pricoa at an interest rate of 3.60%, with US$10m due for repayment in July 2018 and the remainder due for repayment in January 2019.
The interest rate swaps and fixed rate Pricoa debt were entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Within interest Total 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years rate 000 000 000 000 000 2017 Cash and cash equivalents 0.55% 149,522 149,522 --- Loan notes 3.60% 51,752 7,393 44,359 -- Unsecured bank loans 2.56% 164,734 44,359 120,375 -- Government loans 4.43% 7,493 --- 7,493 2016 Cash and cash equivalents 0.36% 74,625 74,625 --- Loan notes 3.60% 56,897 - 8,128 48,769 - Unsecured bank loans 2.09% 268,120 - 48,769 219,351 - Government loans 4.43% 6,308 --- 6,308 Market risk sensitivity analysis Interest rate risk During 2017 the Groups net borrowings were predominantly at floating interest rates.
The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2017.
There is no significant difference between the amount recharged to the income statement and equity in the year.
Profit before tax 000 1% change 2017 Interest rate sensitivity 1,700 2016 Interest rate sensitivity 2,455 Currency risks The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement and equity of a 10% and 25% strengthening or weakening of average actual and transactional currency rates applicable during the year and a 10% and 25% change in the foreign exchange rates applicable for valuing foreign exchange derivative instruments.
qxd 12 03 2018 09:00 Page 29 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 124 23 Government grants and loans The Group through its Canadian subsidiaries Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems TCS and Ultra Electronics Maritime Systems UEMS participates in three Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative SADI, the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect of certain eligible research and development project costs.
Under this arrangement, up to C$32m will be provided to TCS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest.
Up to C$8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2020 to 2033.
The benefit of the below-market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year.
Following delays on some of the TCS programme, a two-year extension of the project completion date to December 2017 and related repayments to 2032 has been agreed with Industry Canada.
The fair value of the loans has been calculated using a market interest rate for a similar instrument.
The valuation used the discounted cash flow method and considered the value of expected payments using a risk-adjusted discount rate: the discount rate used was 18% for TCS and 15% for UEMS.
For TCS, the amount repayable depends on future revenue growth of the TCS business to 2032 and will be between zero and x1.5 of the amounts received up to a maximum of C$47.6m.
For UEMS, the amount repayable depends on future revenue growth of the UEMS business from 2020 to 2033 and will be between x1.0 and x1.5 of the amounts received up until the end of the funding period in 2019.
As at 31 December 2017, C$2.5m had been received by UEMS.
The significant unobservable inputs for this Level 3 financial instrument are i whether, and by how much, TCS UEMS revenues will grow during the periods to 2032 2033, and ii the specific years in which revenue will grow.
There are significant inherent uncertainties in managements ability to forecast revenue over the following 16 years, particularly in later years.
For TCS, if the compound annual revenue growth rate over the period from 2017 to 2032 was 2.5% higher than assumed in the valuation model, then the net present value of the liability as at 31 December 2017 would increase by C$2.3m 1.4m.
If the forecast revenue growth occurs in earlier years than envisaged, then the net present value of the liability will increase: if the revenue growth increases were to occur one year earlier than assumed in the valuation model, then the net present value of the liability as at 31 December 2017 would increase by C$0.8m 0.5m.
TCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec IQ research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and development of certain specified new products.
Under this arrangement, IQ will finance up to C$14m of eligible costs associated with these specified projects.
This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 to 2021, if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made.
As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ programme has been included in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of these programmes were as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Fair value of SADI loan brought forward 6,308 4,289 Contributions 214 262 Interest charged to finance costs 1,133 837 Foreign exchange differences 162 920 Fair value of SADI loan carried forward 7,493 6,308 Government grants credited to profit in the year 2017 2016 000 000 SADI 2,010 1,663 Other 19 - 2,029 1,663 In 2017, Ultra Electronics Limited received a 13,000 grant from the UK Government and a 6,000 grant from the Technology Strategy Board.
Overview Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 125 24 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets, in excess of offsetting tax liabilities, are recognised for loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences to the extent that the utilisation against future taxable profits is probable.
UK deferred tax assets of 1.2m and a US deferred tax asset of 0.7m 2016: Nil have not been recognised as their recovery is uncertain.
Canadian deferred tax assets of 2.5m previously unrecognised 2016: 12.0m have been recognised in this accounting period as their recovery is now considered probable due to forecast profits for the future periods.
Such costs are generally incurred within two years after delivery.
Contract related provisions, for example including provisions for liquidated damages or agent fees, are utilised over the period as stated in the contract to which the specific provision relates.
Other provisions include re-organisation costs, deferred consideration, dilapidation costs and provisions associated with the Oman Airport IT contract termination which were fully utilised during 2017.
Dilapidations will be payable at the end of the contracted life, which is up to fifteen years.
Contingent consideration is payable when earnings targets are met.

All Share Based Payment Arrangements continued The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 March LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2017 Weighted average share price 17.49 17.61 17.47 18.86 Weighted average exercise price 15.71 17.66 17.46 n a Expected volatility % 20.4 23.2 23.9 19.0 Expected option life years 3.8 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk-free interest rate % 0.6 1.4 1.5 0.5 Expected dividends % 2.6 2.4 2.3 0.0 Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2016 Weighted average share price 17.25 17.34 16.99 17.56 Weighted average exercise price 15.51 17.39 16.96 n a Expected volatility % 21.3 23.3 24.4 18.4 Expected option life years 3.6 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk-free interest rate % 0.7 1.5 1.7 0.6 Expected dividends % 2.5 2.4 2.3 0.0 Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.
For the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 March LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at the grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions: 2017 2016 Exercise price n a n a Share price at grant 19.05 17.63 Expected option life years 3.0 3.0 Expected volatility % 19.2 20.5 Risk-free interest rate % 0.4 0.6 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.

The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
The scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1 60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service, however the scheme was closed to future benefit accrual from 5 April 2016.
A defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2016.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes and the Swiss business of the Forensic Technology group has a defined benefit scheme.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 9,848,000 2016: 8,837,000.
Defined benefit schemes All the defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2017 using the projected unit method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme.
The scheme is administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company.
Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the schemes membership and act in the interests of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company.
The Trustees are also responsible for the investment of the schemes assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death.
The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk, inflation risk, investment risk and longevity risk.
The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies.
The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
Investment Strategy The investment strategy is set by the Trustee of the Scheme.
The current strategy is broadly split into growth and matching portfolios.
The growth portfolio is primarily invested in equities, property, diversified growth funds, private equity and private credit.
The matching portfolio is invested primarily in bonds, through the absolute return bonds holding, and liability driven investment LDI funds.
Part of the investment objective of the Scheme is to minimise fluctuations in the Schemes funding levels due to changes in the value of the liabilities.
This is primarily achieved through the use of the LDI funds that aim to hedge movements in the liabilities due to changes in interest rate and inflation expectations.
Currently, the Scheme targets hedging of around 65% on the technical provisions funding measure to both interest rate and inflation expectation changes.
LDI primarily involves the use of government bonds and derivatives such as interest rate and inflation swaps.
The main risk is that the investments held move differently to the liability exposures: this risk is managed by the Trustee, its advisers and the Schemes LDI manager, who regularly assess the position.
The assets held are also well diversified, across asset classes and investment managers.
This reduces the risk of drops in the value of individual asset classes, or a particular manager underperforming its investment objectives, having a negative impact on the funding position of the Scheme.
The investment performance and liability experience are regularly reviewed by the Trustee, and the Trustee will consult with the Company over any changes to the investment strategy.
Rather than holding the underlying assets directly, the Scheme invests in pooled investment vehicles managed by professional external investment managers, whom the Trustee has appointed with the help of its investment advisors.
The equity and diversified growth fund valuations are based on quoted market prices, while the property, private equity, private credit, absolute return bonds and LDI are primarily unquoted.
All valuations are provided by the respective investment manager.
Overview Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 131 30 Retirement benefit schemes continued Valuation The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was on 6 April 2016.
The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2019.
These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence.
This contrasts with these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2016 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2017 by a qualified, independent actuary.
The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland UK Canada Switzerland 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 Discount rate 2.50% 3.50% 0.65% 2.55% 3.50% 0.35% Inflation rate RPI 3.20% 3.20% 1.00% 3.30% 3.30% 0.80% Inflation rate CPI 2.20% 2.20% 1.00% 2.30% 2.30% 0.80% Expected rate of salary increases n a 3.45% 1.00% n a 3.55% 1.00% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 2.95% n a n a 3.05% n a n a Future pension increases post 6 4 08 1.95% n a n a 1.95% n a n a For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.30% and a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate to 2.40% would increase the schemes liabilities by 1.6% and 1.9% respectively.
If the members life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 4.0%.
The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 19 years 2016: 20 years.
The assumptions used are provided by Willis Towers Watson as Company advisors, and also by reference to the Bank of England Gilt curve at a duration appropriate to the Schemes liabilities of 19 years.
At 31 December 2017 this was 1.8% and one month later it was 1.9%: this variation of 0.1% has been used in the sensitivity analysis presented above.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely: Current pensioners 100% SAPS S2PMA L 84% SAPS S2PFA L c2007 CMI 2016 1.25% imps from 2007 UK only Future pensioners 100% SAPS S2PMA L 84% SAPS S2PFA L c2007 CMI 2016 1.25% imps from 2007 UK only The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2017 2016 Current pensioners at 65 males 23 years 23 years Current pensioners at 65 females 26 years 26 years Future pensioners at 65 males 25 years 25 years Future pensioners at 65 females 27 years 28 years Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland Total UK Canada Switzerland Total 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 2016 m m m m m m m m Current service cost - 0.1 0.3 0.4 1.3 0.1 0.2 1.6 Administration expenses 0.9 0.1 - 1.0 0.6 0.2 - 0.8 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 9.6 0.3 0.1 10.0 11.4 0.3 0.1 11.8 Curtailment gain - --- 15.5 - - 15.5 Expected return on pension scheme assets 7.0 0.3 - 7.3 8.4 0.4 - 8.8 Charge credit 3.5 0.2 0.4 4.1 10.6 0.2 0.3 10.1 Of the current service cost for the year, nil 2016: 1.0 million has been included in cost of sales, and 0.4 million 2016: 0.6 million has been included in administrative expenses.

This will be followed by 10.5m in 2019 and 11.0m per annum for the following five years.
31 Acquisitions and disposals On 7 July 2017, Ultra announced that it had entered into a conditional agreement to acquire Sparton Corporation Sparton, its 50 50 partner in the long-standing ERAPSCO joint venture, which supplies sonobuoys to the US Navy.
The transaction was subject to the approval of the United States Department of Justice DOJ under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 HSR.
Following recent discussions with the DOJ, and competition concerns raised by it, Ultra and Sparton mutually decided to terminate the merger agreement in March 2018.
See page 19 for further details.
Acquisitions In aggregate, cash consideration of 6.5m was paid in respect of retention payments for the prior period 3 Phoenix acquisition 2016: 5.2m on final payments and deferred consideration for acquisitions made in prior years.
Disposals The Communications & Security division disposed of its ID business in August 2016 and its remaining legal intercept assets, from the former SOTECH business, in December 2016: both were in the C2ISR CGU group.
Cash proceeds of 22m were received in 2016.
Further proceeds may be received over the 24 month period after the disposal, based on agreed targets: any such proceeds will be accounted for in the year of receipt.
The net loss on disposal was 4,076,000.

34 Contingent liabilities The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business totalling 42.8m 2016: 40.3m.
The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise.
In addition, the Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
In particular, the Oman Airport IT contract was terminated in February 2015.
This has given rise to significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of proceedings in respect of this termination event, and it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcome.

qxd 12 03 2018 09:00 Page 41 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 136 37 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers is effective from 1 January 2018.
A detailed project has been undertaken to determine the impact of IFRS 15.
The project has assessed revenue and contract terms from across all the Groups business units and contracting types.
There is no impact to the timing of the Groups cash flows nor to the timing of revenue recognition on the majority of the Groups contracts.
The table below sets out the impact to the 2017 income statement and balance sheet if IFRS 15 had been applied during the year: 2017 2017 as if presented presented Adjustment under IFRS 15 m m m Income Statement impact Revenue 775.4 7.1 768.3 Cost of sales 545.2 4.7 540.5 Gross profit 230.2 2.4 227.8 Underlying operating profit 120.1 2.4 117.7 Statutory operating profit 61.5 2.4 59.1 Statutory profit before tax 60.6 2.4 58.2 Tax 11.7 0.7 11.0 Statutory profit after tax 48.9 1.7 47.2 2017 2017 as if presented presented Adjustment under IFRS 15 m m m Balance Sheet impact Inventories 76.6 1.2 77.8 Amounts receivable from contract customers 116.7 10.5 106.2 Amounts due to contract customers 58.7 2.8 61.5 Tax liabilities 13.6 0.7 12.9 Net assets 512.2 11.4 500.8 Adjustment to retained earnings 262.6 11.4 251.2 The most significant changes relative to current accounting treatments arise in the following areas: i the accounting for multiple elements of long term contracts approved at different times, for example contracts involving product design, followed by subsequent production orders: ii allocation of the contract price to performance obligations for long term contracts containing multiple deliverables: iii the accounting for certain transactions currently treated as long term contracts that may need to be treated as sales of goods: and iv the accounting for certain licences that are determined to provide separately identifiable benefits to the customer.
The revenue for the substantial majority of contracts that are currently recognised using contract accounting will continue to be accounted for over the life of the contract, however the method by which performance obligations are determined will change on certain contracts including the identification of material rights.
A small number of contracts no longer qualify to be contract-accounted and revenue will instead be recorded at the point at which control of the goods transfers to the customer.
The timing of revenue recognised on the substantial majority of sale-of-goods contracts is not significantly affected with revenue continuing to be recognised as control of goods is passed to the customer.
The project determined that 2016 consolidated group revenue would have been 1.6m higher at 787.4m, and 2016 underlying operating profit would have been 0.2m lower at 130.9m if IFRS 15 had been applied.
As set out in the table above, 2017 consolidated group revenue would have been 7.1m lower at 768.3m, and 2017 underlying operating profit would have been 2.4m lower at 117.7m if IFRS 15 had been applied.
The 1 January 2018 order book increases by 17.0m to 914.4m.
