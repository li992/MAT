The following tables detail the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
It includes both liabilities and assets to illustrate how the cash flows are matched in each period.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross cash inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.

All the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: | Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates: and | The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values or, in the case of interest rate and cross currency swaps, are held at fair value.

com stock code: NTG 29 Financial instruments continued NOTES TO Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to THE ACCOUNTS the Group.
CONTINUED The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
2017 2016 000 000 Trade receivables Trade receivables maximum exposure to credit risk 67,623 71,004 Allowance for doubtful receivables 13,948 12,873 53,675 58,131 Ageing of trade receivables not impaired Not overdue 41,369 52,088 Past due not more than two months 10,624 4,552 Past due more than two months but not more than four months 235 221 Past due more than four months but not more than six months 1,917 1,270 53,675 58,131 Before accepting any new customers, the Group will perform credit analysis to assess the credit risk on an individual basis.
This enables the Group only to deal with creditworthy customers therefore reducing the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, 936,000 2016 802,000 is due from the Groups largest customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas in the UK, Spain and Ireland.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 12,306,000 2016 6,043,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and mainly unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.
Included in the allowance for doubtful receivables are trade receivables with customers which have been placed under liquidation of 448,000 2016 159,000.

The Company has no trade receivables and no intercompany receivables past due date.
