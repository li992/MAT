Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 127 SECTION 2 Financial performance The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement.
It includes a summary of financial performance by each of our businesses 2.1, analysis of certain income statement items 2.22.6 and information regarding underlying earnings, distributable profits and dividends 2.72.10.
Further commentary on our trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 157, with particular reference to key transactions and market conditions that have affected our results.
2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each and a central corporate ofce providing certain specialist and shared functions.
Our businesses are: Power Generation: power generation activities in the UK, including at Drax Power Station and the development of OCGT projects: Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US: and B2B Energy Supply: the supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK.
The operating segments have been renamed to align more closely with the strategy, but are consistent with the prior year, except for changes due to business combinations as noted below.
Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting.
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three operating segments.
The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA as dened on page 120.
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment.
Corporate ofce costs are included within central costs.
During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opus Energy Group Limited see note 5.1, an energy supply business providing electricity and gas to business customers.
Opus Energys activities are closely-related to those of the existing B2B Energy Supply business and the B2B Energy Supply management structure has been reorganised to integrate Opus Energy into the existing structure.
Financial results are reported to the Board for the larger combined business.
Accordingly, this new acquisition forms part of the B2B Energy Supply segment in the yearended 31 December 2017.
Note 5.1 details the additional revenue and profit attributable to the Group from the new acquisition.
As noted on page 16, the Group sold its interest in Billington Bioenergy in the year.
The B2B Energy Supply segment includes 6.3 million of revenue and 0.2million EBITDA losses in respect of this business for the 10-month period to the date of disposal.
Segment revenues and results The following is an analysis of the Groups performance by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2017: Year ended 31 December 2017 Power B2B Energy Pellet 1 Generation Supply Production Adjustments Consolidated m m m m m Revenue External sales 1,686.2 1,999.0 3,685.2 Inter-segment sales 1,033.4 135.7 1,169.1 Total revenue 2,719.6 1,999.0 135.7 1,169.1 3,685.2 Segment gross profit 398.4 117.4 39.0 9.8 545.0 Segment EBITDA 237.5 29.4 5.5 9.8 262.6 Central costs 33.7 Consolidated EBITDA 228.9 Acquisition-related costs 7.8 Depreciation and amortisation 166.3 Other losses 0.4 Loss on disposal 15.4 Unrealised losses on derivative contracts 156.1 Operating loss 117.1 Net finance costs 66.1 Loss before tax 183.2 Note: 1 Adjustments represent the elimination of intra-group transactions 128 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING CONTINUED The following is an analysis of the Groups performance by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2016: Year ended 31 December 2016 Power B2B Energy Pellet 1 Generation Supply Production Adjustments Consolidated m m m m m Revenue External sales 1,622.7 1,326.4 0.7 2,949.8 Inter-segment sales 868.2 72.9 941.1 Total revenue 2,490.9 1,326.4 73.6 941.1 2,949.8 Segment gross profit 337.0 23.5 18.1 2.3 376.3 Segment EBITDA 173.8 4.3 6.3 2.3 160.9 Central costs 20.9 Consolidated EBITDA 140.0 Depreciation and amortisation 109.5 Loss on disposal 3.8 Unrealised gains on derivative contracts 176.8 Operating profit 203.5 Net finance costs 6.4 profit before tax 197.1 Note: 1 Adjustments represent the elimination of intra-group transactions The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Groups financial statements.
The external revenues and results of all the reporting segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to summer months.
Capital expenditure by segment Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis: however, spend on capital projects is monitored by operating segment.
Capital Capital Capital additions Capital additions additions to to property, additions to to property, intangible plant and intangible plant and assets equipment assets equipment 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m B2B Energy Supply 12.6 17.6 4.4 Power Generation 2.4 77.0 0.7 85.7 Pellet Production 0.4 66.2 6.7 Corporate unallocated 0.6 3.8 Total 16.0 164.6 0.7 96.8 Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year were 175.2 million 2016: 93.2 million.
The increase in capital expenditure compared to the previous year principally reflects the acquisition of the LaSalle pellet plant and subsequent investment to bring the site into operation in the Pellet Production segment, and investment in ofce space for Opus Energy in the B2B Energy Supply segment.
Intra-group trading Intra-group transactions are carried out on arms-length, commercial terms that, where possible, equate to market prices at the time of thetransaction.
During 2017, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value of 135.7 million 2016: 72.9 million to thePower Generation segment and the Power Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs with a total value of 1,033.4 million 2016:868.2 million to the B2B Energy Supply segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising 9.8 million at 31 December 2017, is eliminated on consolidation.
Following the increase in output from Pellet Production during the year and reduced generation in Power Generation attheend of the year, intra-group stocks were higher at the end of 2017 than previously, resulting in an increase in this provision.
Major customers Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 doesnot include any amounts from individual customers 2016: amounts of 541.5 million and 399.3 million derived from two customers that represent 10% or more of total revenue for the year.
The Group's largest two customers contributed 9% and 8% of total consolidated revenue respectively.
These revenues arose in the Power Generation segment.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 129 2.2 REVENUE Accounting policy Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity from our Power Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Two of our biomass-fuelled generating units earn Renewable Obligation Certicates ROCs under the UK Governments Renewables Obligation RO regime.
The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel.
A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet see note 3.3 on page 140.
Revenue from sale of ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to a third party.
The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD see below in the income statement, as a component of revenue, at the point the flow of economic benefit becomes probable.
This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due.
Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through our B2B Energy Supply businesses, Haven Power and Opus Energy, is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale.
Energy supplied is measured based upon metered consumption and contractual rates: however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is included as accrued income on the balance sheet.
Other revenues derived from the provision of services for example, the supply of system support services, such as black start and frequency response to National Grid are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
Most such contracts are for the delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated with reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed.
Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in estimating probable future outcomes.
Other revenues derived from the sale of goods for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum are recognised at the point the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customers premises.
CfD payments The Group is party to a Contract for Difference CfD with the Low Carbon Contracts Company LCCC, a Government-owned entity responsible for delivering elements of the Governments Electricity Market Reform Programme.
Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from a specic biomass-fuelled generating unit.
The payment is calculated with reference to a strike price of 100 per MWh.
The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs.
The strike price at 31 December 2017 was 106 per MWh.
When market prices at the point of generation are above below the strike price, the Group makes receives an additional payment to from LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price.
Such payments are in addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.
The year ended 31 December 2017 is the first full year of generation under the CfD contract, which commenced on 21 December 2016.
ROC sales The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Groups financial performance.
The RO scheme started in April 2002 and places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources.
Under the RO, ROCs are certicates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to suppliers to demonstrate that they have fullled their obligations under the RO.
ROCs are managed in compliance periods CPs, running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 2002.
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the buy-out price at the end of the CP.
The buy-out price was set at 30 per ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation.
ROCs are typically procured in arms-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP.
At the end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the recycle fund, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators.
The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP.
See note 3.3 on page140 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by our Power Generation business and those utilised by our B2B Energy Supply business in the year.

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT Accounting policy The Group reviews its xed assets or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units CGUs whenever there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered.
The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually.
The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of four CGUs.
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU value in use or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant fair value less costs to sell.
The initial assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value in use.
Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGUs assets in their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs.
Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to the CGUs activities.
Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges.
132 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT CONTINUED The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Groups assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any future restructuring or reorganisation.
In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using a pre-tax rate reflecting the specic risks attributable to the CGU in question.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually see note 5.2.
Assessment of indicators of impairment The Group's market capitalisation has remained below the carrying value of its net assets this year.
As part of the most recent annual review, the Group considered this and concluded that a potential indicator of impairment existed in respect of the Drax Power CGU.
This assessment was based upon continued weakness in commodity markets, volatility in foreign exchange rates, perceived levels of regulatory uncertainty and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount of Drax Power's assets to changes in these factors.
Accordingly, an impairment review of the Drax Power CGU was undertaken at the balance sheet date.
A review of other CGUs suggested no indicators of impairment.
significant estimation uncertainty The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions.
In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon managements estimates of future prices, output, costs, economic support for renewable energy generation and access to contracts for electricity generation and supply.
Where relevant and to the fullest extent possible, the key assumptions are based on observable market information.
However, observable market information is only available for a limited proportion of the remaining useful lives of the assets under review.
Impairment review The carrying amount of the Drax Power CGU at 31 December 2017 was 1,430 million.
The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested using the Groups established planning model.
The analysis assumed that Drax Powers three biomass-fuelled generating units will continue in operation until the end of their estimated useful lives, currently considered to be 2039.
In line with our assumption that coal-red generation will cease by 2025, applied in light of the Government's announced intention to close coal-red generation following recent consultations, the three remaining coal-red units were assumed to cease coal-red generation by this date but will then be available for conversion to alternative fuels.
No account has been taken of any cash inflows that could result from such a conversion which could take place earlier than 2025 in measuring the value in use of the Drax Power CGU.
This includes potential cash flows arising from the fourth unit conversion to biomass and possible repowering of the fifth and sixth units to gas.
The analysis depends on a broad range of assumptions, including the expected life of the six power generating units and the regulatory regime under which they might operate.
The key assumptions i. e. those most sensitive to a change, possibly resulting in a different outcome for impairment are considered to be: the expected operating lives of the six generating units, as described above: future commodity prices beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase and sale commitments notably power prices and biomass prices: future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase commitments: and the continuance of existing biomass support regimes CfD and RO until 2027 and the existence of a favourable economic environment for biomass generation thereafter.
This includes future capacity market and system support revenues.
These assumptions are all dependent on external market movements.
The historic volatility in these assumptions is reflected in the financial performance of the Group but past performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future values.
Where available, estimates of future prices are based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties.
Intra-group purchases of biomass are included at contract prices which are based on our view of future market prices.
Transactions beyond contracted positions are valued using market data and forward price curves, based where possible on data points provided by a reputable third party source, independent to the Group.
In particular, longer-term power prices are based on assumptions from Aurora Energy Research.
The contracted period for biomass purchases is substantially longer, with the longest-dated contracts expiring in 2027.
Beyond this point, estimated biomass prices are largely based on our internal models which reflect our assessment of future market prices.
Future foreign exchange rates are based on contracted foreign currency purchases to the extent possible.
Beyond our contracted position, exchange rate estimates are based on market forward curves.
Current Government plans for existing renewable support mechanisms, namely the CfD and RO, assume these cease in 2027.
The impairment analysis made no assumptions regarding the direct replacement of these support mechanisms beyond this date.
The biomassfuelled units that are assumed to continue to generate power do so supported by the prevailing wholesale power price, delivery of ancillary services to the UK grid and an expectation that capacity market revenues will be available to these units.
Our power price forecasts reflect increased volatility between peak and baseload prices.
Assumed revenues from ancillary services and the capacity market are based on projections derived from current contracts and capacity market outcomes and how we expect the market to evolve.
These assumptions Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 133 2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT CONTINUED reflect our expectation that Drax will be required to provide generation to support intermittent renewable power and be an essential part of the UKs energy mix throughout the life of the units.
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax nominal rate of 7.3%.
The discount rate is supported by observable market reports and independent analysis commissioned by, and specic to the circumstances of, the Group and the Power Generation business.
This indicated that the recoverable amount of the Drax Power CGU exceeded its carrying value and therefore that no provisions for impairment were required.
Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when compared to our base case assumptions, a reduction of approximately 21% in market power prices, an increase in biomass prices of approximately 31%, or a depreciation of Sterling against the US Dollar of approximately 24% throughout the 22-year term of the valuation would result in a recoverable amount for the Drax Power CGU that is lower than its carrying amount.
Furthermore, the valuation includes cash flows for the period from 20272039 in line with the assumed useful economic lives of the assets.
Ifthe value from this period was removed in its entirety, it would not result in an impairment charge.
The analysis does not consider the interaction effect of potential changes in several or all of the assumptions simultaneously, and the sensitivities do not take account of any mitigating actions that could be taken should the changes referred to materialise.
In addition, in relation to central costs, no reasonable change in the method of allocation would result in an impairment charge.
2.5 NET FINANCE COSTS Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure such as interest payable on our bonds as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives see note 5.4 and net interest charged on the Groups dened benefit pension scheme obligation see note 6.3.
These are offset by interest income that we generate through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses for example through investment in money market funds.
On 5 May 2017, the Group renanced its external debt.
The resulting cost of 24.2 million 2016: nil reflects the costs incurred to extinguish the existing debt together with the release of the related deferred borrowing costs.
As described in note 2.7, these costs have been excluded from the calculation of underlying earnings.
Further information about the new finance structure can be found in note 4.3.

Sterling strengthened against the US Dollar and Euro during2017, resulting in losses being recognised on assets the Group holds denominated in these currencies.
134 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this years taxable profits which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax and adjusted for estimates for previous years.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax rate on the loss before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction.
Taxable profit or loss differs from profit loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
significant estimation uncertainty In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
In December 2017, US Tax Reforms were legislated and introduced a package of tax measures, including a reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21% from January 2018.
This rate reduction has been reflected in the US deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017.
We do not anticipate any other impact of the US Tax Reforms on the deferred tax balances.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 135 2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION CONTINUED The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the loss before tax as follows: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Loss profit before tax 183.2 197.1 Loss profit before tax multiplied by the rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.25% 2016: 20% 35.3 39.4 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior periods 11.8 3.6 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.3 1.7 Impact of change to tax rate 15.7 9.8 Difference in overseas tax rates 3.0 4.8 Deferred tax on prior year start-up losses and other temporary differences 21.4 Other 1.0 1.7 Total tax credit charge 32.1 3.2 The Groups underlying effective tax rate is sensitive to the mix of operating results between our UK and US businesses and the tax rates which apply in those jurisdictions.
However, as a result of the reduction in the US federal tax rates from 2018 to 21%, and tax relief now arising to the group from the UK Patent Box regime see below, in the medium term we anticipate our group underlying effective tax rate to be marginally lower than the main rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The adjustments in respect of prior periods principally relate to a Patent Box claim.
Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass.
Under UK tax legislation the Company is now entitled to apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that technology.
The Company has agreed a claim with HMRC for tax relief covering the period from the patent application in 2013 to 2016 amounting to 10.4 million.
In line with the policy intentions of IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, the Group has also recognised an estimated benefit from the tax regime for the financial year 2017 of 2.6 million included in the Other line in the table above.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below.

Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of 22.7 million in relation to start-up losses and other temporary differences in the US-based Pellet Production business.
Based on its business plan and reflecting continuing improvement in operational performance, the Group anticipates generating sufficient profits in future periods against which to utilise this asset.
2.7 UNDERLYING EARNINGS Following the announcement of the change in the Group's dividend policy on 15 June 2017, there is no longer a link between underlying earnings and the calculation of distributions.
We have continued to present underlying earnings, an alternative performance measure seepage 120, to provide a consistent, comparable measure of the overall financial performance of the Group year-on-year.
Underlying earnings is dened as profit after tax, as measured in accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and material one-off items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the business.
This note analyses the items which are included in our results for the year but are excluded from underlying earnings: Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts: calculated in accordance with IAS 39 on derivative contracts not designated into hedge relationships for accounting purposes but held for the purposes of fide-risking future cash flows see note 7.2, excluded due to their inherent volatility which does not reflect current operational performance.
Acquisition-related costs: material one-off costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Opus Energy during 2017.
Cost of debt restructure: material one-off costs incurred as part of the restructuring of the Group's debt in May 2017.
In 2016, deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences: a material one-off credit arising from the recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to the Pellet Production business.
Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Earnings: Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings 151.1 193.9 Adjusted for: Unrealised gains on derivative contracts 156.1 176.8 Acquisition-related costs 7.8 Cost of debt restructure 24.2 Tax impact of the above items 34.3 33.9 Deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences 30.5 Underlying profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the Company 2.7 20.5 2.8 EARNINGS PER SHARE AND UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share EPS represents the amount of our earnings post-tax profits that is attributable to each ordinary share we have in issue.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings profit after tax calculated in accordance with IFRS by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options such as those to be issued under our employee share schemes see note 6.2, that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS.
Underlying EPS is based upon underlying earnings as dened in note 2.7.
The effect of potentially dilutive options on the weighted average number of shares in issue at the balance sheet date is shown below: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 Number of shares: Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share millions 406.8 406.6 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares under share plans 3.5 2.7 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share millions 410.3 409.3 Earnings per share basic pence 37 48 Earnings per share diluted pence 37 47 Underlying earnings per share basic pence 1 5 Underlying earnings per share diluted pence 1 5 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 137 2.9 DIVIDENDS Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year based on the number of shares in issue at the record date : Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 4.9 pence per share paid on 4 October 2017 2016: 2.1 pence per share paid on 7 October 2016 20.0 8.6 Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2016 of 0.4 pence per share paid on 12 May 2017 2015: 0.6 pence per share paid on 13 May 2016 1.6 2.4 21.6 11.0 As described on page 49, on 15 June 2017 we announced a new dividend policy.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of anal dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 7.4 pence per share equivalent to approximately 30 million payable on or before 11May2018.
The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2017.
This would bring total dividends payable in respect of the 2017 financial year to 50 million.
In future years, in determining the value of dividends the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the Groups commodity based businesses.
If there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Groups investment needs the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.
2.10 RETAINED PROFITS Retained profits are a component of our equity reserves.
The overall balance reflects the total profits we have generated over our lifetime, reduced by the amount of that profit we have distributed to our shareholders.
The table below sets out the movements in our retained profits during the year.
Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m At 1 January 566.5 385.2 Loss profit for the year 151.1 193.9 Actuarial gains losses on dened benefit pension scheme note 6.3 21.4 8.4 Deferred tax on actuarial gains losses on dened benefit pension scheme note 2.6 4.1 1.6 Equity dividends paid note 2.9 21.6 11.0 Net movements in equity associated with share-based payments note 6.2 6.1 5.2 At 31 December 417.2 566.5 Distributable profits The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and cash resources.
The immediate cash resources of the Group of 222.3 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 4.4.
The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited.
The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 172177 of this report, disclose the Parent Companys distributable reserves of 229.7 million.
sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in accordance with the Groups updated dividend policy for the foreseeable future.
The majority of the Groups distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries.
Management actively monitors the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves.
The Group's new nancing facilities see note 4.3 place certain conditions on the value of dividend payments to be made in any given year.
We expect to be able to make dividend payments, in line with our new policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable future.
