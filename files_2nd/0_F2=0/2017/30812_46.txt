Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 2 Segmental analyses As the chief operating decision maker, the Management Board reviews external revenues and adjusted profit from operations to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources to the overall business.
The results of Next Generation Products as a separate segment are currently not material to the Group and therefore it is not considered a reportable segment that requires separate disclosure under the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating segments.
Interest income, interest expense and taxation are centrally managed and accordingly such items are not presented bysegment as they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability.
The five geographic regions are the reportable segments for the Group as they form the focus of the Groups internal reporting systems and are the basis used by the Management Board for assessing performance and allocating resources.
The Management Board reviews current and prior year segmental revenue, adjusted profit from operations of subsidiaries and joint operations, and adjusted post-tax results of associates and joint ventures at constant rates of exchange.
The constant rate comparison provided for reporting segment information is based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year results of the Group, including intercompany royalties payable in foreign currency to UK entities.
However, the Group does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in operations which are generated by movements in exchange rates.
In respect of the United States region, all financial statements and financial information provided by or with respect to the US business or RAI and or the RAI Group are prepared on the basis of US GAAP and constitute the primary financial statements or financial information of the USbusiness or RAI and or the RAI Group.
