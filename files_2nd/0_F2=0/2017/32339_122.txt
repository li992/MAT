What are our internal revenue and costs?
Most of our internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the customer-facing lines of business.
This occurs both directly, and also indirectly, through TSO which is included within the Other segment.
Wholesale and Ventures internal revenue arises from EE for mobile ethernet access and TSO for transmission planning services.
Internal revenue in Business and Public Sector relates primarily to the use of BT Irelands network by other lines of business.
Internal revenue arising in Consumer relates primarily to employee broadband and wi-fi services, while internal revenue in Global Services relates primarily to conferencing services.
Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price.
Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business and therefore line of business profitability may be impacted by transfer pricing levels.
The tables below show internal revenue and costs recorded by each line of line of business.

Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that have value to a customer on a standalone basis, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
Total contract consideration is allocated between the separate elements based on their fair value.
We apply judgement in both identifying separate elements and allocating consideration between them.
Sales of bundled offers in our mobile businesses frequently include a handset and a telecommunications service contract.
There is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the telecommunications service to be delivered and this represents the revenue recognised in respect of the services delivered.
The residual value of the bundled offer therefore represents the revenue in respect of the handset.
For offers that cannot be separated into identifiable elements, revenues are recognised in full over the life of the contract.
The main example is connection to a service where this does not represent a separately identifiable transaction from the subscription.

How do we determine our geographic information?
The UK is our country of domicile and we generate the majority of our revenue from external customers in the UK.
The geographic analysis of revenue is based on the country of origin in which the customer is invoiced.
The geographic analysis of non-current assets, which exclude derivative financial instruments, investments and deferred tax assets, is based on the location of the assets.
