The UK is the Companys country of domicile.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2017 2015-16: 52 weeks ended 27 March 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in its associate undertakings and joint venture.
The consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board on 17 May 2017.
Basis of preparation and accounting The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, as that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates, and all values are rounded to the nearest whole million except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historic cost basis, except for pension assets and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value.
Accounting reference date The financial reporting year ends on the last Sunday in March and, accordingly, these financial statements are prepared for the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2017 2015-16: 52 weeks ended 27 March 2016.
Presentation of results and accounting policies The Groups significant accounting policies, including details of new and amended accounting standards adopted in the reporting year, can be found after the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements and associated Notes have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB i. e. on a reported basis.
In some instances, Alternative Performance Measures APMs are used by the Group.
This is because Management are of the view that these APMs provide a more meaningful basis on which to analyse business performance, and are consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by Management and reported to the Board.
Details of the APMs used by the Group are provided on page 33.
Going concern In assessing the going concern status of the Group, the Directors are required to look forward a minimum of 12 months from the signing date of these financial statements, to ensure that there is sufficient headroom to enable the Group to pay its creditors as they fall due.
The Directors have reviewed business projections and assessed these against committed and undrawn funding facilities 1,018 million at 26 March 2017 and other liquid resources available to the Group cash at bank 144 million and cash equivalent investments 133 million at 26 March 2017.
Funding facilities and cash and cash equivalents available to the Group are described in further detail in Notes 18 and 21.

Segment information The Groups revenue, costs and earnings before interest and tax are segmented in this Note to align with how business performance is managed and reported to the Royal Mail plc Board.
The Groups operating segments are based on geographic business units whose primary services and products relate to the delivery of parcels and letters.
These segments are evaluated regularly by the Chief Executives Committee and the Royal Mail plc Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
In the year, following the acquisition of the minority shareholding 49 per cent on 31 March 2016, Romec Limited, previously reported in a third operating segment in 2015-16, has been incorporated into the UKPIL segment.
This is to better reflect how the segments resources are managed and reported to the CODM.
The 2015-16 comparative information has been restated accordingly.
There has also been a representation of 141 million costs between infrastructure costs and other operating costs in the Group income statement.
Of the residual businesses previously included in the Other segment in 2015-16, the Group disposed of its 51 per cent shareholding in NDC 2000 Limited NDC on 24 April 2016 and the results of the Quadrant Catering Limited associate company do not materially impact Group results.
A loss of 2 million has been recognised in the income statement for the disposal of NDC.
A key measure of segment performance is operating profit before transformation costs used internally for the Corporate Balanced Scorecard.
This measure of performance is disclosed on an adjusted basis, a non-IFRS measure, excluding specific items and the pension charge to cash difference adjustment see APMs section on page 33.
This is consistent with how financial performance is measured internally and reported to the CODM.
Segment revenues have been attributed to the respective countries based on the primary location of the service performed.
Transfer prices between segments are set at arms length fair value on the basis of charges reached through negotiation between the relevant business units that form part of the segments.
Trading between UKPIL and GLS is not material.

Current tax The current tax charge for the Group is mainly in respect of GLS.
UK taxable profits in 2016-17 are partially covered by a combination of brought forward losses and capital allowance claims.
Accordingly, the current tax rate for the Group is 18 per cent 2015-16: 17 per cent.
Effective tax rate The effective tax rate on reported profit is 19 per cent 2015-16: 17 per cent, comprising current tax due on reported profits and deferred tax in relation to temporary differences.
This rate is below the UK statutory rate, principally due to changes to tax law detailed below, tax 3 overprovided in previous years and no tax charge recognised in relation to property disposals.
The majority of the prior year overprovision is in relation to tax incentives in earlier years.
GLS pays tax in a number of territories, with the majority of its profits in the reporting year to 26 March 2017 earned in territories where the tax rate is above the UK statutory tax rate.
Certain subsidiaries, notably GLS France, continue to not recognise deferred tax credits on losses made during the reporting year as it is not sufficiently certain of its capacity to utilise them in the future.
These factors contribute to GLS having a higher effective tax rate for the year than the UK statutory rate.
1 The 2015-16 profit includes 31 million in respect of discontinued operations.
2 The 2015-16 charge includes 5 million in respect of discontinued operations.
3 No tax charge has been recognised on property disposals included in specific items, as no tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the grounds that, were the assets into which the gains have been rolled over to be sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise.

Taxation continued The deferred tax position shows an increased overall liability in the reporting year to 26 March 2017.
This increase in the liability is primarily as a result of the deferred tax impact of the increase in the surplus in RMPP.
The movement in pensions temporary differences credited to Other comprehensive income includes a credit of 43 million 2015-16: 48 million relating to the change in tax law detailed below.
Additionally a charge of 65 million 2015-16: 59 million credit has been recognised in relation to the IFRIC 14 adjustment detailed in Note 9.
GLS has deferred tax assets and liabilities in various jurisdictions which cannot be offset against one another.
The main elements of the liability relate to goodwill and intangibles in GLS Germany, for which the Group has already taken tax deductions, and acquisition intangibles in relation to ASM and GSO.
At 26 March 2017, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of 73 million 2015-16: 68 million comprising 68 million 2015- 16: 62 million relating to tax losses of 259 million 2015-16: 234 million, mainly in GLS, that are available for offset against future profits if generated in the relevant GLS companies, and 5 million 2015-16: 6 million in relation to 30 million 2015-16: 30 million of UK capital losses carried forward.
The Group has not recognised these deferred tax assets on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain of its capacity to utilise them in the future.
The Group also has temporary differences in respect of 211 million 2015-16: 211 million of capital losses, the tax effect of which is 36 million 2015-16: 38 million in respect of assets previously qualifying for industrial buildings allowances.
Further temporary differences exist in relation to 212 million 2015-16: 217 million of gains for which rollover relief has been claimed, the tax effect of which is 36 million 2015-16: 40 million.
No tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the basis that, were the assets into which the gains have been rolled over to be sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise.
Changes to UK corporation tax rate Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20 per cent to 19 per cent effective from 1 April 2017 and to 17 per cent effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 and 15 September 2016 respectively.
In future, this will reduce the Group's current tax charge accordingly.
In accordance with accounting standards, the effect of these rate reductions on deferred tax balances has been reflected in these financial statements, dependent upon when temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Earnings per share This Note explains the calculation of the Groups earnings per share.
The adjusted earnings per share a non-IFRS measure is a key indicator used by Management to assess earnings performance.

Retirement benefit plans In applying IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the Group has recognised a pension asset of 3,839 million at 26 March 2017, compared with 3,430 million at 27 March 2016.

They represent the cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll 28.8 per cent 2015-16: 29.8 per cent of the increase in the defined benefit obligation due to members earning one more years worth of pension benefits.
They are calculated in accordance with IAS 19 and are based on market yields high quality corporate bonds and inflation at the beginning of the reporting year.
Pensions administration costs for the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP of 5 million 2015-16: 6 million continue to be included within the Groups ongoing UK pension service costs.
2 At the beginning of August 2015, PSE was introduced under which eligible employees who are enrolled into PSE opt out of making employee contributions to their pension and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in basic pay.
As a result, there is a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of 151 million 2015-16: 99 million in the reporting year.
3 The employer contribution cash flow rate 17.1 per cent in both the current and prior year forms part of the payroll expense and is paid into the RMPP.
The contribution rate is set following each actuarial funding valuation, usually every three years.
These actuarial valuations are required to be carried out on assumptions determined by the Trustee and agreed by Royal Mail.

Ongoing UK defined contribution plan costs have increased from 63 million in 2015-16 to 82 million including 31 million PSE costs.
This is mainly due to the introduction of PSE, but also as a result of the continued increase in plan membership and an increase in the average employers contribution rate from 5.7 per cent in 2015-16 to 6.0 per cent in 2016-17.
UK Defined Benefit plans Royal Mail Group Limited had one of the largest defined benefit pension plans in the UK based on membership and assets, called the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP.
On 1 April 2012 one week into the 2012-13 reporting year after the granting of State Aid approval by the European Commission to HM Government on 21 March 2012 almost all of the historic pension liabilities and pension assets of RMPP, built up until 31 March 2012, were transferred to a new HM Government pension scheme, the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme RMSPS.
On this date, RMPP was also sectionalised, with Royal Mail Group Limited and Post Office Limited each responsible for their own sections from 1 April 2012 onwards.
The transfer left the Royal Mail section RM section of the RMPP fully funded on an actuarial basis.
On this basis, using long-term actuarial assumptions agreed at that date, it was predicted the Company would have to make no further cash deficit correction payments relating to the historic liabilities.
All further references in this Note to the RMPP, relate to its RM section.
Royal Mail Pension Plan The RMPP is funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds.
RMPP includes sections A, B and C, each with different terms and conditions: Section A is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined before 1 December 1971: Section B is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined on or after 1 December 1971 and before 1 April 1987, or for members of Section A who chose to receive Section B benefits: and Section C is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined on or after 1 April 1987 and before 1 April 2008.
Benefits provided are based on final salary in respect of service to 31 March 2008, and on career salary blocks for each year of service, revalued annually, for service from 1 April 2008.
Royal Mail Pensions Trustees Limited acts as the corporate trustee to the RMPP.
Within the Trustee, there is a Trustee Board of nine nominated Trustee Directors.
The Trustee Board is supported by an executive team of pension management professionals who provide day-to-day plan management, advise the Trustee on its responsibilities and ensures that decisions are fully implemented.
The Trustee has several responsibilities.
It must always act in the best interests of all RMPP beneficiaries including active members, deferred members, pensioners and beneficiaries.
Specifically, it must pay all benefits as they fall due under the Trust Deed and Rules.
The Trustee is responsible for: monitoring the RMPP - to help protect benefits, the Trustee monitors the financial strength of the participating employers: investing contributions - the Trustee invest the member and employer contributions in a mix of equities, bonds, property and other investments including derivatives.
It holds all the contributions and investments on behalf of the members: and keeping members informed - the Trustee sends active members an annual benefit illustration, which shows what members can expect in the future, together with a summary of the RMPPs annual report and accounts.
2013 Pensions Review In June 2013, the Group began a consultation with RMPP members on a proposal to ensure the RMPP could remain open to future accrual, subject to certain conditions, at least until the conclusion of the next periodic review in March 2018.
Subsequently, on 26 September 2013, the Company agreed with the RMPP Trustee to implement a Pensions Reform with effect from 1 April 2014.
This agreement enabled the March 2012 actuarial valuation to be concluded, and allowed the Companys regular future service contribution rate for RMPP, expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay, to remain at 17.1 per cent.
The RMPPs investment strategy was developed to mitigate the largest risks movements in interest rates and inflation rates.
This has enabled the Company to maintain its March 2018 commitment.
As part of the March 2012 actuarial valuation, the Group agreed to pay additional contributions of up to 50 million a year from April 2016 onwards if the RMPP Trustee considers these necessary to maintain the RMPPs projected funding position in March 2019.
The RMPP Trustee has carried out its assessment of liabilities as at March 2016 and confirmed that no payment was due for 2016-17.
Following agreement on the revised Schedule of Contributions, such assessments will no longer be carried out.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 | 109 Royal Mail plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9.
Retirement benefit plans continued 2018 Pensions Review In January 2017, the Company consulted RMPP members about its proposal for the future of the RMPP.
The consultation closed on 10 March 2017.
Following a review of member feedback, on 13 April 2017 the Company announced that it had not found an affordable way to keep the 4 RMPP open in its current form after March 2018, and had made the decision to close the RMPP to future accrual on 31 March 2018.
On 8 May 2017, after the balance sheet date, agreement was reached between the Company and the RMPP Trustee on the March 2015 actuarial valuation and a revised Schedule of Contributions.
In accordance with the new Schedule of Contributions, the service contribution rate for 2017-18 will remain at 17.1 per cent.
The March 2015 valuation continues to show the scheme in surplus and therefore no deficit correction payments are expected to be made.
The Company expects to contribute around 320 million and employees around 110 million towards the RMPP in 2017-18.
Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP Royal Mail Group Limited also contributes to a smaller defined benefit plan for executives, RMSEPP which closed in December 2012 to future accrual, therefore the Group makes no regular future service contributions.
As agreed in the February 2013 Funding Agreement with the Trustees, the Group makes deficit correction payments of 10 million per annum until at least the date on which the 2018 valuation is completed no later than 30 September 2018.
Deficit correction payments in 2016-17 were 10 million 2015-16: 10 million.
The RMSEPP triennial valuation at 31 March 2015 has been completed, based on the assumptions agreed as part of the Funding Agreement made between the Company and the Trustee in 2013.
In April 2016 the RMSEPP Trustees purchased a buy-in policy of insurance in respect of pensions in payment of its oldest members.
This is considered an asset of the RMSEPP and does not confer any rights to individual members.
All benefit payments due from the RMSEPP remain unchanged.
The insurance policy exactly matches the value and timing of the benefits payable under the RMSEPP for the oldest members and the fair value is deemed to be the present value of the related obligation.
The buy-in policy valued at 151 million is included as a pension asset and a pension liability at 26 March 2017.
A liability of 2 million 2015-16: 2 million has been recognised for future payment of pension benefits to a past Director.
Accounting and actuarial surplus position RMPP and RMSEPP The combined plans assets and liabilities are shown below.
Accounting IAS 19 Actuarial cash funding At 26 March At 27 March At 31 March At 31 March 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m 5 Fair value of plans assets 9 b below 9,847 7,374 10,066 7,442 Present value of plans liabilities 5,992 3,815 8,984 5,665 Surplus in plans pre IFRIC 14 adjustment 3,855 3,559 1,082 1,777 IFRIC 14 adjustment 16 129 n a n a Surplus in plans 3,839 3,430 1,082 1,777 There is no element of the present value of the plans liabilities above that arises from plans that are wholly unfunded.
Accounting IAS 19 As the Group has a legal right to benefit from a surplus, under IAS 19 and IFRIC 14 it is required to recognise the economic benefit it is assumed it will derive either in the form of a reduction to future contributions or a refund of the surplus.
In the current period, the RMPP surplus is assumed to be fully recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions as the economic benefit resulting from comparing the future service costs to the employer contributions is more than the accounting surplus.
Therefore, no IFRIC 14 adjustment is required.
Following the Companys decision to close the RMPP, after 31 March 2018 the surplus will no longer be assumed to be recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions.
If this had been the position at 26 March 2017, only one year of economic benefit would be recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions, with the remaining surplus assumed to be available as a refund.
This would result in an additional IFRIC 14 adjustment of 1,176 million and a reduction in the overall 26 March 2017 pension surplus net of IFRIC 14 from 3,839 million to 2,663 million.
On this basis, the deferred tax liability in respect of the surplus as at 26 March 2017 of 647 million would be reduced to 85 million.
It is not currently anticipated that any curtailments will arise as a result of the closure of RMPP.
Included in the IAS 19 figures in the table above is an RMSEPP surplus at 26 March 2017 of 47 million pre IFRIC 14 2015-16: 37 million surplus.
As RMSEPP is closed to future accrual, the surplus is assumed to be available as a refund as per IFRIC 14 and, as such, is shown net of taxation withheld in both years.
4 The decision was made to close Sections B and C of the RMPP to future accrual.
Section A of the Plan which has a small number of active members remains open to future accrual.
5 Difference between accounting and actuarial cash funding asset fair values arises from the different year end dates used for the valuation of the assets under both methods.
110 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9.
Retirement benefit plans continued The Directors do not believe that the current excess of pension plan assets over the liabilities on an accounting basis will result in an excess of pension assets on an actuarial cash funding basis.
However, the Directors are required to account for the pension plan based on their legal right to benefit from a surplus, using long-term actuarial assumptions current at the reporting date, as required by IFRS.
The legal right to benefit from a surplus has not changed as a result of the changes agreed between the Company and Trustee on 8 May 2017.
Actuarial cash funding The actuarial funding surplus of the RMPP and RMSEPP is 1,082 million at 31 March 2017 2015-16: 1,777 million surplus.
The cost of benefits being accrued to RMPP each year, based on market conditions at the end of March 2017, would currently be 1,260 million.
This is significantly greater than projected 2017-18 contributions of 320 million by the Company and 110 million by employees.
Accordingly we expect the actuarial surplus would be exhausted during 2018 if the RMPP had remained open in its current form.
The following disclosures relate to the major assumptions, sensitivities, assets and liabilities in the RMPP and RMSEPP.
a Major long-term assumptions used for accounting IAS 19 purposes - RMPP and RMSEPP The major assumptions used to calculate the accounting position of the pension plans are as follows: At 26 March At 27 March 2017 2016 Retail Price Index RPI 3.2% 3.0% Consumer Price Index CPI 2.2% 2.0% Discount rate nominal 2.5% 3.5% 6 real nominal less RPI 0.7 % 0.5% 7 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Rate of increase for deferred pensions CPI CPI Rate of pension increases RMPP Sections A B CPI CPI 7 Rate of pension increases RMPP Section C RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Rate of pension increases RMSEPP members transferred from Section A or B of RMPP CPI CPI 7 Rate of pension increases RMSEPP all other members RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old male RMPP member 28 26 years 29 27 years Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old female RMPP member 31 29 years 32 30 years 6 The real discount rate used reflects the long average duration of the RMPP of around 30 years.
7 The rate of increase in salaries, and the rate of pension increase for Section C members who joined RMPP on or after April 1987 and RMSEPP all other members, is capped at five per cent, which results in the average long-term pension increase assumption being 10 basis points lower than the RPI long-term assumption.
Mortality The March 2017 mortality assumptions have been updated in line with the March 2015 valuation.
The RMPP assumptions are based on the latest Self-Administered Pension Scheme SAPS S2 mortality tables with appropriate scaling factors 116 per cent for male pensioners and 109 per cent for female pensioners.
Future improvements are based on the CMI 2015 core projections with a long-term trend of 1.5 per cent per annum.
Sensitivity analysis for RMPP liabilities The RMPP liabilities are sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
The potential impact of the largest sensitivities on the RMPP liabilities is as follows: Potential Increase in liabilities Key assumption change m Additional one year of life expectancy 220 Increase in inflation rate both RPI and CPI simultaneously of 0.1% p. a.
160 Decrease in discount rate of 0.1% p. a.
160 Increase in CPI assumption assuming RPI remains constant of 0.1% p. a.
30 This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on a method that assesses the impact on the defined benefit obligation, resulting from reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting year.
Changes inverse to those in the table e. g. an increase in discount rate would have the opposite effect on liabilities.
The average duration of the RMPP obligation is 30 years 2015-16: 27 years.

Risk exposure and investment strategy The investment strategy of the RMPP Trustee aims to safeguard the assets of the Plan and to provide, together with contributions, the financial resource from which benefits are paid.
Investment is inevitably exposed to risks.
The investment risks inherent in the investment markets are partially mitigated by pursuing a widely diversified approach across asset classes and investment managers.
The RMPP uses derivatives such as swaps, forwards and options to reduce risks whilst maintaining expected investment returns.
The RMPP Trustee recognises that there is a natural conflict between improving the potential for positive return and limiting the potential for poor return.
The RMPP Trustee has specified objectives for the investment policy that balance these requirements.
The largest risks faced by the RMPP are movements in interest rates and inflation rates.
To reduce the risk of movements in these rates driving the RMPP into a funding deficit, and the Group not being able to maintain its March 2018 commitment, the RMPP Trustee has hedged in advance, a significant proportion of the funding liabilities which it is estimated will build up by March 2018.
It has done this predominantly through investment in index-linked gilts and derivatives interest rate and inflation rate swaps held in Unit Trust pooled investments providing economic exposure to gilts.
The impact of the RMPPs advance hedging of projected funding liabilities is to increase near term volatility in the pension surplus, due to the return on the liability-hedging assets not being matched by an increase in the accrued liabilities.
As the accrued liabilities get closer to the projected liabilities that have been hedged, this volatility will reduce.
The increase in the liabilityhedged assets is predominantly reflected in the Unit Trust values above which have increased from 4,188 million at 27 March 2016 to 6,004 million at 26 March 2017.
The notional value covered by the interest rate swaps full exposure to the relevant asset class incurred by entering into a derivative contract held in a specific managed portfolio for this purpose at 26 March 2017 is 2.3 billion 2015-16: 2.6 billion and the notional value covered by the inflation rate swaps at 26 March 2017 is 1.9 billion 2015-16: 1.8 billion.
The equity exposure of RMPP was reduced in October 2016 by means of a short Total Return Swap TRS, a derivative that can be used to reduce exposure to a particular asset class without selling the physical assets held.
TRS were introduced in order to control some downside risk whilst broadly maintaining the existing expected returns.
The TRS economically offset 260 million of the Plans global equity exposure.
The spread of investments continues to balance security and growth in order to pay the RMPP benefits when they become due.
In addition to holding return-seeking assets, RMSEPP holds long-dated index linked gilts of 26 million 2015-16: 191 million and the buy-in annuity policy of 151 million at 26 March 2017 2015-16: nil to match its liabilities.

An initial review of trade debtors has not indicated any recoverability issues.
The intangible assets recognised at fair value on acquisition relate to customer lists, software and brands.
The goodwill of 90 million arising on these acquisitions is indicative of the acquired business knowledge of products and markets, and synergies that are expected through the integration of services.
No material fair value adjustments have been identified in respect of the remaining assets and liabilities acquired in the year.
Revenue generated from these entities since the date of acquisition is 139 million and the combined profit is 7 million, of which 51 million and 1 million relates to GSO, respectively.
If these combinations had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, revenue generated would have been 222 million and the combined profit would have been 11 million, of which 98 million and 3 million relates to GSO, respectively.
The Group obtained control of GSO on 30 September 2016, through the acquisition of 100 per cent of the companys voting equity interest.
GSO is a regional next day parcel delivery company, operating principally in California, and was purchased as part of GLS careful and focused expansion outside of Europe.
There are no material non-controlling interests in relation to these acquisitions.

This goodwill has been reviewed for impairment in line with IAS 36.
The carrying value of GLS, excluding interest-bearing and tax-related assets and liabilities, is 718 million 2015-16: 557 million and the operating profit before transformation costs is 164 million 2015-16: 117 million for the year see Note 2.
The carrying value of GLS of 718 million represents a multiple of 4.4 2015-16: 4.8 of operating profit before transformation costs.
The net realisable value of GLS, for the purposes of the impairment review i. e. the fair value less costs of disposal, has been assessed with reference to EBITDA earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector of 6.6 fair value hierarchy level 2 input.
On this basis, the net realisable value has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value.
The earnings multiples referenced would need to reduce by more than 48 per cent to 3.4 to reduce the net realisable value to below the carrying value.
The remaining goodwill of 17 million 2015-16: 14 million arising from an aggregation of business acquisitions within the UKPIL business unit is not material in the context of the Groups total goodwill.

2013 and 2014 SIP 613 shares were awarded in October 2013 to each eligible full-time employee, with a further 116 shares allocated to eligible full-time employees in April 2014.
Part-time eligible employees were allocated a pro-rata number of shares for both allocations.
For both full-time and part-time eligible employees, the award of shares is subject to them remaining employees of Royal Mail Group Limited over the vesting period.
The vesting period for each award is three years from the award date with all allocated shares to be equity-settled.
2015 SIP On 5 October 2015 ordinary shares representing one per cent of the Company were granted free of charge to eligible full-time employees by HM Government, in addition to a portion of the unallocated shares arising from earlier SIP schemes.
Accordingly, each eligible full-time employee received 103 shares as their 2015 SIP allocation with part-time eligible employees being allocated a pro-rata number of shares.
All allocated shares will be equity-settled.
2016 SIP On 6 October 2016 ordinary shares representing one per cent of the Company were granted free of charge to eligible full-time employees by HM Government.
Accordingly, each eligible full-time employee received 81 shares as their 2016 SIP allocation with part-time eligible employees being allocated a pro-rata number of shares.
The fair value of the 2016 award of Free Shares is 50 million including 2 million National Insurance which is being charged to the income 1 statement on a straight-line basis, adjusted for good leavers and forfeitures, over the three year period of vesting from the award date.
The fair value of the award was established based on prevailing market prices at the award date and did not incorporate expected dividends.
A charge to the income statement of 105 million including 5 million National Insurance has been made for the year ended 26 March 2017 for all four SIP allocations see page 27 of Financial Review.
1 Good leavers refers to former employees whose shares vested under specific circumstances, in accordance with the rules of the scheme.

Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme On 24 July 2014, a SAYE share option scheme was introduced for eligible employees.
Under the terms of the scheme, the Board permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares in the Company to those employees who enter into an HMRC-approved SAYE savings contract.
These contracts are for a term of three years, with contributions from employees of an amount between 5 and 59 each month.
The options purchased may be exercised during the six month period following the end of the contract at an exercise price of not less than 80 per cent of the average of the mid-market quotations of an ordinary Share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date.
A charge to the income statement of 2 million has been made for the year ended 26 March 2017 2015-16: 3 million in relation to the SAYE scheme.
The table below shows the movements in share options during the reporting year.
Number of options Balance at the beginning of the reporting year 13,915,040 Options exercised 141,911 Options forfeited 901,519 Balance at the end of the reporting year 12,871,610 For SAYE options exercised during the year by good leavers, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 477.4 pence.
The weighted average exercise price for each of the above categories of share options is 360 pence.
As a result of the scheme rules in relation to good leavers, 130,360 2015-16: 85,860 share options were exercisable at 26 March 2017 at a weighted average exercise price of 360 pence.
The fair values of the options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model.

Assets and liabilities held for sale This Note provides details of the assets classified as held for sale at the beginning and end of the reporting year.
Assets and liabilities are classified in this way when their carrying value is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
Their value in the balance sheet is the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
At the reporting date of 26 March 2017, only certain surplus property assets are held for sale.
The balance sheet values of the assets held for sale during the reporting year are shown below.
At 26 March At 27 March 2017 2016 m m Property assets held for sale 37 39 Total 37 39 Property assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale of 37 million 2015-16: 39 million relate to land and buildings which are being actively marketed with a view to a sale within 12 months, including the former South London Mail Centre site in Nine Elms, Vauxhall.
An assessment of the fair value of these properties was made at the time of their reclassification to held for sale and no adjustment to the carrying amount of these properties was necessary.

Loans and borrowings continued The 500 million bond, issued in July 2014, is shown net of issue discount and fees and at a closing spot rate of 1 1.157.
The effective interest rate on the bond 2.5 per cent consists of the interest coupon of 2.375 per cent plus the unwinding of the discount and fees on issuing the bond 0.08 per cent.
The bond is designated as a hedge of the net investment in GLS, which has the Euro as its functional currency.
During the year, a loss of 38 million 2015-16: 26 million on the retranslation of this borrowing was transferred to other comprehensive income, which offsets the gains on translation of the net investment in GLS.
There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the current or comparative reporting years.
In March 2017, the Group extended 952 million of the syndicated bank loan facilities for a further year to March 2022 with the remaining 98 million maturing in March 2020.
The syndicated bank loan facility can be cancelled and any loans drawn under the facility can become repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreements.
These events of default include non-payment, insolvency and breach of covenant relating to interest excluding arrangement fees, adjusted net debt and EBITDA.
It is not anticipated that the Group is at risk of breaching any of these obligations.
The covenants require the Group to maintain the leverage ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA below 3:1 and EBITDA to interest excluding certain arrangement fees above 3.5:1.
Adjusted net debt consists of net debt plus Letters of Credit contingent liabilities in respect of the UKPIL insurance programme, where the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote and is adjusted for exchange rate movements during the year.
The Groups ratio of EBITDA to interest excluding certain arrangement fees at 26 March 2017 is 53.1:1 2015-16: 63.0:1.
Accordingly, the Group comfortably meets the covenants tests within its syndicated bank loan facilities agreement.
The interest rate chargeable on the syndicated bank loan facility would increase if more than one third of the facility was drawn and also if the Group's leverage ratio exceeded 1:1.
Under the loan agreement, the maximum interest rate chargeable would be LIBOR plus 1.45 per cent.
The 500 million bond becomes repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default under the bond agreement.
These events of default include non-payment and insolvency.
The undrawn committed facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date, all expire in more than two years.
There is no security in place under the syndicated bank loan facilities or the bond.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management In considering the financial assets and liabilities of the Group, Management use judgment to assess the materiality to users of the financial statements, at a Group level, of each of the disclosure areas highlighted in IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures.
This assessment is based on both the magnitude and nature of the financial instruments involved and informs the level of disclosure of the risk management objectives and policies in place across the Group provided in this Note.
The following table summarises the disclosures: Disclosure requirement a Classification, carrying amount and fair values of financial assets and liabilities - Carrying amounts and fair value of each category of financial assets and liabilities.
b Foreign currency risk management - How Management address the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
c Commodity price risk management - How Management address the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
d Interest rate risk management - How Management address the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
e Liquidity risk management - How Management address the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
f Credit risk management - How Management address the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.
g Sensitivity analysis - How the income statement and balance sheet would have been affected by changes in commodity prices and exchange rates in the reporting year.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the business operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations and are not considered further in this Note.
No speculative trading in financial instruments has been undertaken during the current or comparative reporting years, in line with Group policy.
b Foreign currency risk Foreign currency transaction risk UKPIL is exposed to foreign currency risk due to interest payments on the 500 million bond, certain obligations under Euro-denominated finance leases, trading with overseas postal administrations and various purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency.
GLS functional currency is the Euro and it also has some exposure to non-Euro currencies, principally in emerging European markets, and to the US Dollar.
Where possible, exposures are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a combination of external spot and forward purchase and sale contracts.
Hedging will not normally be considered for exposures of less than 1 million and hedging is normally confined to 80 per cent of the forecast exposure, where forecast cash flows are highly probable.
124 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued The following table shows for each hedge programme, the risk and the percentage hedged of the next 12 months exposure: Percentage of next 12 months exposure that has been hedged At 26 March At 27 March Hedge programme Risk 2017 2016 Capital programmes exchange rate movements 96% 100% Overseas postal administrations SDR exchange rate movements 40% 69% The next 12 months exposure is calculated as the combination of the cost of settling liabilities during the next 12 months and the cost of revaluing unsettled liabilities at the end of 12 months.
Foreign currency translational risk The Groups functional currency is Sterling.
GLS Euro profits are converted at the average exchange rate for the year, which can result in reported growth or decline that does not relate to underlying performance.
GLS balance sheet is converted at year end exchange rates, and movements related to foreign currency translation are taken to equity.
The 500 million bond issued in July 2014 acts as a hedge of part of the translation exposure created by the net assets of GLS.
Royal Mail also entered into 30 million of Euro-denominated finance leases during the year 2015-16: 37 million which similarly act as a hedge of the net assets of GLS.
The remaining net assets of GLS in excess of the bond and lease payables are not hedged.
Foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net assets of GLS, the 500 million bond and the Euro-denominated finance lease payables, at closing Sterling Euro exchange rates, are deferred into equity.
These exchange differences would be released from equity to the income statement as part of the gain or loss if GLS was sold.
During the year foreign currency exchange losses on the bond of 38 million 2015-16: 26 million and foreign exchange losses on the lease payables of 4 million 2015-16: 2 million were deferred into equity.
There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the current or prior reporting years.
The net total financial liabilities are held in various different currencies as summarised in the table below.
The majority of the nonSterling financial assets and liabilities other than the 500 million bond and 59 million of finance leases are held within cash or derivatives.
Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Net total financial assets liabilities at 26 March 2017 27 21 385 42 337 Net total financial assets liabilities at 27 March 2016 13 10 290 29 258 c Commodity price risk UKPIL is exposed to fuel price risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe - which consumes over 130 million litres of fuel per year - and a jet fuel price risk arising from the purchasing of air freight services.
The Groups fuel risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets.
The strategy uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to manage these exposures.
In addition, the Group is exposed to the commodity price risk of purchasing electricity and gas.
The Groups risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the electricity and gas markets.
These exposures are managed by locking into fixed price contracts with suppliers and using forward commodity price swaps in Sterling.
As the GLS business relies on the use of subcontractors, responsible for purchasing their own fuel, GLS has no direct exposure to diesel costs.
The only other significant commodity exposure within GLS is electricity, which is fragmented across its European bases.
In view of the other highly hedged positions, the Group takes the view that the unhedged exposure arising from the commodities in GLS does not add significant risk to the Group.
d Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate financial instruments, combined with external hedging of interest rate risk, as appropriate, to keep a high percentage of its gross debt fixed.
At 26 March 2017 there was no external hedge of interest rate risk 2015-16: none.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The analysis below sets out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk.

At 26 March 2017 there were drawings of 32 million 2015-16: nil representing a loan of US$40 million at a closing spot rate of US$1.25.
The total interestbearing financial assets of the Group excluding the non-current investments of 211 million 2015-16: 247 million, which consist of the fixed and floating rate cash and cash equivalent investments, plus current financial asset investments, are at short-dated fixed or variable interest rates with an average maturity of one day 2015-16: an average maturity of six days.
These short-dated financial instruments are maturity-managed to obtain the best value out of the interest yield curve.
126 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued Obligations under finance leases are either unsecured or secured on the leased assets.
The average interest rate is 2.8 per cent 2015-16: 3.3 per cent.
The average maturity date is more than five years 2015-16: more than five years.
The pension escrow investment represents a money market fund investment established to provide security to the Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP, in support of a deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustee in June 2013.
The next scheduled review point in the agreement is 30 September 2018 and the investment is therefore disclosed as maturing in one to two years.
e Liquidity risk The Groups primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
This is achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows.
Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed to ensure continuity of funding.
The unused facilities for the Group of 1,018 million expire in 2020-22 2015-16: 1,050 million expiring in 2020-21.
Below is a summary of the gross undiscounted contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities.
The cash flows for the 500 million bond and Euro-denominated finance leases represent the undiscounted total amounts payable interest and nominal repayment which have been converted to Sterling at 26 March 2017 market forward exchange rates.
For derivatives that are settled gross, these cash flows represent the undiscounted gross payment due and do not reflect the accompanying inflow.
For derivatives that are settled net, these cash flows represent the undiscounted forecast outflow.

The credit policy is applied rigidly within the regulated products area to ensure that UKPIL is not in breach of compliance legislation.
Assessment of credit for non-regulated products is based on commercial factors, which are commensurate with the Groups appetite for risk.
An analysis of aged debt is included within Note 17.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 | 127 Royal Mail plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued The Groups exposure to credit risk from other financial assets arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
At 26 March 2017, 95 per cent of financial assets 2015-16: 97 per cent were held with AA or above rated counterparties.
GLS operates a decentralised credit management model whereby each country is responsible for managing the credit risk associated with its customers.
Where appropriate, external credit checks are performed for new and existing customers, taking into account the customer profile, expected volume of business and consequent risk to the respective GLS companies.
None of the financial assets is either past due or considered to be impaired.
g Sensitivity analysis As a result of the mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments and the currency and commodity hedge programmes in place, the Group has no material exposure to 2017-18 operating profit risk from interest rate risk or commodity price risk 2015-16: nil million risk.
The Group has an exposure to the exchange rate risk on translating the GLS profits: on trading with overseas postal administrations: on various purchase contracts and on the interest on the 500 million bond and Euro-denominated finance leases.
The impact of a ten per cent strengthening of Sterling across all currencies on forecast profits trade during 2017-18 would be to reduce the Group operating profit by 4 million 2015-16: 4 million.
However, changes in exchange rates could also cause other impacts on operating profit including a change in import export volumes.
The Group has an exposure to the exchange rate risk on translating the GLS net assets into Sterling on consolidation.
This is partially offset by an exposure on translating the 500 million bond and Euro-denominated finance leases into Sterling at each balance sheet date.
The impact of a ten per cent strengthening of Sterling against the Euro at 26 March 2017 would have been to reduce the Group net assets by 19 million 2015-16: 10 million.

Consequently, a provision was first recognised in 2010-11.
The Group has derived its current provision by using estimates and ranges calculated by its actuarial adviser, which are based on current experience of claims, and an assessment of potential future claims, the majority of which are expected to be received over the next 25 to 30 years.
The Group has a rigorous process of ensuring that only valid claims are accepted.
13 million was reclassified to Other provisions during the year presented within accruals previously in respect of GLS liabilities, mainly in respect of litigation claims.
