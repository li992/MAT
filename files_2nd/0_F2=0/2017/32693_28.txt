Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 July 2017 1 Accounting policies and critical estimates andjudgements Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and its committees.
Ferguson plc is a public company limited by shares incorporated in Jersey under the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland.
The Company changed its name from Wolseley plc to Ferguson plc on31 July 2017.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis see page 41 and under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
The Groups presentational currency will change from sterling to US dollars from 1 August 2017.
The Nordic businesses have been reclassied as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and the consolidated financial statements and affected notes for the year ended 31 July 2016 have been restated to reect this.
Accounting developments and changes At the time of this report a number of accounting standards have been published, but not yet applied.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers are effective for the Group from the year ending 31 July 2019.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and it is expected adoption will not have a material impact onthe Groups consolidated financial results.
IFRS 16 Leases, which is yet to be endorsed by the EU, is effective for the Group for the year ending 31 July 2020.
IFRS 16 represents a significant change for the treatment of leases in the lessees financial results.
Lessees will be required to apply a single model to recognise a lease liability and asset for all leases, including those classied as operating leases under current accounting standards note 34, unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less.
On adoption of IFRS 16 there will be a significant change to the financial statements, as each lease will give rise to a right of use asset, which will be depreciated on a straight-line basis, and a lease liability, with the related interest charge.
This will replace existing lease balances on the balance sheet and charges to the income statement.
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however the impact will depend on the transition approach and the contracts in effect atthe time of adoption.
It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Groups consolidated financial results.
Choices permitted by IFRS The Group has elected to apply hedge accounting to some of its financial instruments.
Accounting policies Note 37 details the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements Exceptional Items Note 2 provides a denition of exceptional items.
The classication of exceptional items requires significant management judgement to determine the nature and intentions of a transaction.
Note 5 provides further details on current year exceptional items.
Pensions and other post-retirement benets The Group operates dened benefit pension plans in the UK and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions.
The cost of providing benets is determined annually using the Projected Unit Credit Method, which includes actuarial assumptions for discount rates, expected salary and pension increases, ination and life expectancy and are disclosed in note 26.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high quality corporate bonds that have a maturity approximating to the terms of the pension obligations.
significant judgement is required when setting the criteria from which the yield curve is derived.
Sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the Groups accounting policies, various transactions and balances are valued using estimates or assumptions.
Should these estimates or assumptions prove incorrect there may be an impact on the following years financial statements.
The Group believes that the estimates and assumptions that have been applied would not give rise to a material impact within the next financial year.
90 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financials Other information 2 Alternative performance measures The Group uses alternative performance measures APMs, which are not dened or specified under IFRS.
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for IFRS measures, provide additional helpful information.
APMs are consistent with how business performance is planned, reported and assessed internally by management and the Board and provide comparable information across the Group.
The Group reports some financial measures net of businesses or branches that have been disposed of, closed or classied as held for sale and uses the following terminology: Non-ongoing operations: businesses and groups of branches, which donot meet the criteria to be classied as discontinued operations under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which have been disposed of, closed or classied as held for sale.
In 2017, the Groups Swiss business, Tobler, and a small Industrial business in the USA, Endries, have been classied as non-ongoing.
Ongoing operations: continuing operations excluding non-ongoing operations.

These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement category to assist in theunderstanding of the trading and financial results of the Group as these types of cost do not form part of the underlying business.
Examples of items that are considered by the Directors for designation asexceptional items include, but are not limited to: material restructuring costs within a segment incurred as part of a significant change in strategy or due to the closure of a large part of a business and are not expected to be repeated on a regular basis.
significant costs incurred as part of the integration of an acquired business and which are considered to be material.
gains or losses on disposals of businesses are considered to be exceptional in nature as they do not reect the performance of the trading business.
costs or credits arising as a result of material regulatory and litigation matters.
If provisions have been made for exceptional items in previous years, thenany reversal of these provisions is treated as exceptional.
Exceptional items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 5.

The changes in revenue and trading profit for continuing operations between the years ended 31 July 2016 and 31 July 2017 include changes in exchange rates, disposals, acquisitions and organic change.
Where businesses are disposed in the year, the difference between the revenue and trading profit in the current year up to the date of disposal and the revenue and trading profit in the equivalent portion of the prior year is included in organic change.

This results in interest deductions and lower taxable profits in many of the countries and therefore reduces the tax rate.
The pre intra-group nancing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate is 32.7 per cent 2016: 37.6 per cent and this is reduced to a post intra-group nancing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate of 24.4 per cent 2016: 25.5 per cent.
The 1.1 per cent decrease inthe post intra-group nancing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate is primarily due to a change in profit mix.
b This includes adjustments arising out of movements in uncertain tax provisions regarding prior periods and differences between the final tax liabilities in the tax computations and the taxliabilities provided in the accounts.
The non-ongoing and other credit of 11 million relates primarily to a one-off settlement of tax enquiries in the UK.
c In 2016, this relates primarily to non-tax deductible impairment of goodwill in the UK.
d In 2017, this relates primarily to non-taxable disposals of businesses.
e This reects managements assessment of the potential tax liability for the current year in relation to open tax issues and audits.
f This relates to certain expenditure for which no tax relief is available such as disallowable business entertaining costs.
g This relates to the reduction in the UK standard rate of corporation tax from 20 per cent to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020.
The rate change was considered exceptional in2016 on the grounds that it was only announced at the end of the 2015 financial year and could not be foreseen in the Groups forecast ongoing effective tax rate for the 2016 financial year.
h Ongoing profit means profit before tax, exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets for ongoing operations as dened in note 2.
Ongoing tax is the tax expense arising on ongoing profit.
i Non-ongoing and other profit or loss is profit or loss from non-ongoing operations as dened in note 2 and from the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items.
Non-ongoing and other tax is the tax expense or credit arising on the non-ongoing and other profit or loss.

The forecast for year five represents an estimate of mid-cycle trading performance for the CGU based on historic analysis.
Year four is calculated as the average ofthe final year of the strategic plan and year ves mid-cycle estimate.
The other inputs include a risk-adjusted, pre-tax discount rate, calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of each country and the 30-year long-term growth rate by country, as published by the IMF in April 2017.
The strategic plan is developed based on analyses of sales, markets and costs at a regional level.
Consideration is given to past events, knowledge offuture contracts and the wider economy.
It takes into account both current business and future initiatives.
Management has performed a sensitivity analysis across all CGUs which have goodwill and acquired intangible assets using reasonably possible changes in the following key impairment review assumptions: compound average revenue growth rate, post-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate, keeping all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity testing identied no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

102 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financials Other information 15 Associates In April 2017, the Group acquired a 39.21% share in Walter Meier AG, a trading company whose principal place of business is Switzerland and which is engaged in the distribution and maintenance of heating and air conditioning systems.
The investment in Walter Meier AG is accounted for as an associate using the equity method.
Walter Meier AG prepares accounts under Swiss GAAP FER with a year-end of 31 December.
The Groups accounts have been prepared based on Walter Meier AGs half year accounts ended 30 June 2017.
There were no significant transactions between that date and 31 July 2017 and no material differences would arise if the accounts were prepared under IFRS.
Summarised financial information from Walter Meier AGs half year accounts ended 30 June 2017 is set out below.

Accordingly, the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have predominantly been calculated based on a 17 per cent tax rate which materially reects the rate for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse.
Net deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis that sufficient taxable profits are forecast to be available in the future toenable them to be utilised.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised gross tax losses totalling 328 million 2016: 68 million that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
These losses have no expiry date and relate predominantly to capital losses.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
However, tax may arise on284 million 2016: 253 million of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that suchdifferences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

23 Financial instruments and financial risk management Capital structure To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure based on current and forecast trading, the Groups principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items.
The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this ratio remains within 1 to 2 times.
The Groups main borrowing facilities contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items to 3.5:1.
The reconciliation of opening to closing net debt is detailed in note 32.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Liquidity During the year ended 31 July 2017, the Groups US$600 million revolving credit facility has been extended by one year and matures in December 2019.

This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2017 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
The Group has insurance that it believes is sufficient cover for the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables.
Based on current estimates, theamount of performing insurance cover signicantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash ow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Due to the nature of these provisions, the timing of any settlements is uncertain.
Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims andclaims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group principally USA casualty and global property damage.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches.
In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash ows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The weighted average maturity ofthese obligations is approximately three years.

Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 109 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2017 26 Retirement benefit obligations i Long-term benefit plans provided by the Group The Group has a dened benefit pension plan for certain of its UK employees.
This plan was closed for future service accrual in December 2013 and during October 2016 the plan was closed for future non-inationary salary accrual.
The Group operates a number of smaller plans in other jurisdictions, providing pensions or other long-term benets such as long service or termination awards.
More information about the plans operated by the Group is set out on page 126.
During the year, the Group secured a buy-in insurance policy with Pension Insurance Corporation PIC for the UK pension plan.
This policy covered all ofthe pensioner members of the plan and exactly matches the benets provided by the plan.
This has led to the recognition of an asset in respect of this policy exactly equal to the insured liabilities at 31 July 2017.
The difference between the premium paid and the asset recognised in respect of this policy has been recognised as an actuarial movement in other comprehensive income.

For executive share option plans and all-employee sharesave plans, the range of exercise prices for shares and options outstanding at 31 July 2017 was 12.69 to 42.96 2016: 7.01 to 33.62.
For the ordinary share plan and long term incentive plans, all share options outstanding at 31 July 2017 had an exercise price of nil 2016: nil.
For shares and options outstanding at 31 July 2017, the weighted average remaining contractual life was three years 2016: four years.
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated using the binomial methodology for all plans except the portion of the grants awarded under the long term incentive plan that are subject to a relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used.
The fair value of shares granted under the ordinary share plan was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: Ordinary share plans All-employee sharesave plans Long term incentive plans 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Risk-free interest rate 0.3% 0.7% 0.1% 0.6% 0.3% 0.7% Expected dividend yield 2.7% 3.0% 2.4% 2.7% 0.0% 2.2% Expected volatility 22% 23% 22% 25% 22% 23% Expected life 13 years 3 years 16 years 16 years 3 years 3 years There were no executive share options granted in the period.
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historical volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility due totheGroups capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009.
Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.

Further adjustments may be necessary when additional information is available for some of the judgemental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which the Group hasgained access and additional profitability and operating efficiencies available in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed 214 million to revenue, 29 million to trading profit and 12 million to the Groups operating profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before and after tax, as the Group manages its borrowings asaportfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been 15,277 million and Group trading profit would have been 1,062 million.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders, asstated above.
It is also not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would havebeen acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a cash ow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to itsinitial carrying amount.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Fair value measurements canbeclassied in the following hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market such as over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.

The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well-dened policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2017 and 31 July 2016.
By the nature of its business, the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated tothe operating businesses.
There has been no change since the previous year in the major financial risks faced by the Group.
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below.
When the Group enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period underreview, the Groups policy that no trading innancial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital risk management The Groups sources of funding currently comprise cash ows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outows excluding interest income and income from derivatives including interest payable in respect of its trade and other payables and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis.
The principal assumptions are that oating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date and cash ows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
These cash ows can be analysed by maturity as follows: 2017 2016 Trade and Trade and other Interest other Interest payables Debt on debt Total payables Debt on debt Total As at 31 July m m m m m m m m Due in less than one year 1,935 125 40 2,100 2,280 5 44 2,329 Due in one to two years 20 4 37 61 19 122 40 181 Due in two to three years 21 1 34 56 12 2 37 51 Due in three to four years 10 213 34 257 14 1 37 52 Due in four to five years 91 27 37 8 215 31 254 Due in over five years 120 606 66 792 110 847 116 1,073 Total 2,115 950 238 3,303 2,443 1,192 305 3,940 Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 79 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars.
Within each country it operates, the Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash ow exposures.
However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts orcurrency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only a temporary effect.
The Groups policy is to adjust the currencies in which its net debt is denominated materially to match the currencies in which its trading profit is generated.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation ofoverseas balance sheets for the principal currencies used by the Group are shown in the five-year summary on page 139.

The principal value of those financial liabilities designated as hedges at the balance sheet date was 1,528 million 2016: 1,636 million.
