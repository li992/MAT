Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 December 2017 1.
General information Just Eat plc the Company and its subsidiaries the Group operate a leading digital marketplace for takeaway food delivery.
Further details about the Groups operations and principal activities are disclosed within the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 43.
The Company is a public limited company listed on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
Its registered address is Masters House, 107 Hammersmith Road, London W14 0QH, United Kingdom.
Basis of preparation This section describes how these financial statements have been prepared, as well as the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the Group has identified that could potentially have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the next 12 months.
This note also sets out the significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is generally applicable toaspecific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note.
Where the Group believes any new accounting standards yet to be adopted could have a material impact, these have also been disclosed in this note.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS andIFRS Interpretation Committee interpretations as endorsed by the European Union EU, and with those parts of theCompanies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Theestimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to berelevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Any revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Critical judgements are those which management has made in applying the Groups accounting policies that could potentially have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the next 12 months.
In the current year, the only critical judgement identified by management relates to capitalised development costs.
Revenue derived from connection fees and the fair value measurement of equity-settled transactions with employees, are no longer considered to be critical judgements, as the risk of significant differences is considered remote.
The recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities is also no longer considered to be a critical judgement, as there have been no new acquisitions completed during the year and in turn, no judgements were made in the current year.
Capitalised development costs Internally developed websites, apps and other software, that together make up the Just Eat ordering platforms are capitalised as an intangible asset where it is determined by management that the ability to develop the asset is technically feasible and the project will generate probable economic benefits.
The total amount capitalised in the year was 18.8 million 2016: 10.5 million, see Note 13 for further details.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Discussed in this section are the key assumptions regarding the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The Group has identified impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and taxation to be the key sources of .
As there were no new business combinations that completed during the year, the risk of a significant difference in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets occurring in the next 12 months is considered remote.
Fair value of deferred consideration is also no longer considered to be a key source of estimation uncertainty as the risk of a material adjustment to the carrying value of SkipTheDishes Restaurant Partners Inc. s SkipTheDishes deferred consideration is considered remote.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets The Groups balance sheet includes significant carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets.
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD and its value in use VIU.
Determining whether an asset is impaired requires an estimation of the VIU of the CGU to which the asset has been allocated.
The VIU calculation is based on a discounted cash flow DCF model.
The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to.
In some instances, the cash flow forecasted period is greater than five years as the CGU is in immature markets that are currently lacking penetration, and where future investment in the business is expected to result in its long-term growth being achieved.
The VIU is sensitive to the discount rate used as well as the expected future cash inflows.
com 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 2.
Basis of preparation continued Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets continued Where the VIU calculation indicates a CGU may be impaired, management estimates the CGUs FVLCD using level 3 measurement techniques.
This involves management completing a DCF model using variables a market participant would likely apply.
This DCF is different to the VIU, as cash flows are modelled for 10 years and a higher discount rate is applied to reflect the additional risk premium a market participant would expect.
The FVLCD is also sensitive to the discount rate and the expected future cash inflows.
The highest risk of impairment resides in the Australia & New Zealand ANZ CGU and the Mexico CGU.
An impairment charge of 180.4 million was recognised in the current year relating to the ANZ CGU.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for ANZ, Mexico and all other CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in Note 12.
Taxation The Groups tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges arising in each jurisdiction.
As a result ofthe Groups growing global footprint and the changing global tax environment and income taxes arising in numerous jurisdictions, there are some transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
Thecalculation of the Groups total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters where the taximpact is uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process.
Resolving taxissues can take several years and is not always within the control of the Group.
Current tax liabilities are recognised for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a taxing authority.
These may be, for example, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued.
Liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions are measured based on managements interpretation of country-specific tax law and assigning probabilities to the possible likely outcomes and range of taxes payable in order to ascertain a weighted average probable liability.
In-house tax experts, external tax experts and previous experience are used to help assess the tax risks when determining and recognising such liabilities.
See Note 10 for further details of the 17.4 million tax provision held at 31 December 2017, which includes an amount relating to the ongoing transfer pricing audit in Denmark.
Where the final amounts payable are different to the liabilities recognised in previous periods, the required adjustments in respect of prior years are recorded in the current period in the income statement, or directly in equity, as appropriate.
Significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for assets and liabilities acquired as partof abusiness combination, deferred contingent consideration, provisions, available-for-sale investments, derivative financial instruments, and other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss, which have been measured at fair value.
The policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial andoperating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights, through currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights, or by way of contractual agreement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align with the Group accounting policies.
All intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities, including unrealised profits arisingfrom them, are eliminated upon consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company and are presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from equity attributable to shareholders of the Company.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.
c Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each subsidiary are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each subsidiary are expressed in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and also the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.

Basis of preparation continued Significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole continued c Foreign currencies continued Non-monetary items carried at fair value, that are denominated in foreign currencies, are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences on monetary items receivable or payable to a foreign operation where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur inthe foreseeable future therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation, which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items aretranslated atthe average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate.
On the disposal of a foreign operation i. e. a disposal of the Groups entire interest in a foreign operation, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
d Going concern For reasons noted on page 23, the financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least 12months from the date of signing these financial statements.
At the date of approving the financial statements, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances that could lead to the Group being unable to settle commitments as they fall due during the 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements.
Although for the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group incurred a loss before tax of 76.0 million, the Group had net current assets of 44.1 million and cash net of borrowings of 264.4 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group generated cash inflows from operating activities of 166.7 million.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 43.
Note 33 describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its exposure to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
e Non-GAAP information The Group has provided the readers with additional information in the Annual Report that is regularly reviewed by management.
Certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
Underlying EBITDA uEBITDA The main measure of profitability used by management to assess the performance of the Groups businesses is uEBITDA.
Itisdefined as earnings before finance income and costs, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA, and additionally excludes long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, foreign exchange gains and losses, other gains and losses, and the share of results from associates falling outside this definition.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM uses uEBITDA to assess internal performance in conjunction with uEBITDA margin, as management believe it closely correlates to cash generated from operating activities, as it excludes items that are either non-cash or non-recurring in nature.
Management believe it is both useful and necessary to report uEBITDA asa performance measure as it enhances the comparability of profit or loss across segments.
Accordingly, Executive Team incentives are partially based on uEBITDA results.
A reconciliation of uEBITDA to operating profit is provided in the income statement and in Note 3 on a segmental basis.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is the main measure of earnings per share used by the Group and is calculated using anunderlying profit measure attributable to the equity shareholders.
It is defined as profit attributable to the equity shareholders, before long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, other gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, amortisation in respect of acquired intangible assets, share of results from associates below uEBITDA, and the tax impact of these adjusting items.
The Directors believe that it is both useful and necessary to report Adjusted EPS, as the measure is: used for internal performance rating: used in setting the Executive Team remuneration: and useful in connection with discussions within the investment analyst community.
A reconciliation of adjusted profit is provided in Note 11. www.
com 97 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 2.
Basis of preparation continued New and amended standards adopted by the Group No new standards, amendments or interpretations to standards effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on1 January 2017 have had a material impact on the Groups financial position or performance, nor the disclosures in these financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory at 31 December 2017 and have not been early adopted by the Group.
The Groups assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations on its results, financial position and cash flows is set out below: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments This standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard addresses the classification and measurement of financial instruments and will require additional disclosures.
Further to this, a new impairment measurement model for financial assets based around expected credit losses has been introduced.
There isno longer arequirement for a credit event to have occurred before a credit loss is recognised.
There is also a new hedge accounting model that aligns with how entities undertake risk management activities when hedging financial and non-financial risk exposures.
The Group intends to designate equity instruments, such as those in Note 16, as fair value through other comprehensive income.
Fair value movements in this category have not been significant in previous years.
We have considered the impact of the standard to the 2017 financial statements, and the Directors have determined that the new standard will not have a material impact to the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers This standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
When IFRS 15 is adopted, it can be applied either on a fully retrospective basis, requiring the restatement of the comparative periods presented in the financial statements, or with the cumulative impact of IFRS 15 applied as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption.
When the latter approach is applied, it is necessary to disclose the impact of IFRS 15 on each line item in the financial statements in the reporting period.
The Group has not yet determined which method will be adopted.
IFRS 15 provides a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with Customers: 1 identify the contract with the Customer: 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract, introducing the new concept of distinct: 3 determining the transaction price: 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contracts, on a relative stand-alone selling price basis: and 5 recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies its performance obligation.
IFRS 15 also introduces new guidance on, amongst other areas, combining contracts, discounts, variable consideration and contract modifications.
It requires that certain costs incurred in obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts be deferred onthe balance sheet and amortised over the period an entity expects to benefit from the customer relationship.
Management has conducted a detailed accounting scoping analysis across each of the Groups operating segments and their various revenue streams.
Management has assessed accounting implementation approaches for each revenue stream based on the potential materiality, complexity and volatility of the impact.
Qualitatively, management expects no change in the treatment of order-driven revenue, top-placement fees and most of other revenue.
The revenue stream with a change under IFRS 15 is connection fees, which are currently being deferred between 12and 36 months.
From 2018, the performance obligations relating to connection fees will be deemed to have been satisfied over the average life of a Restaurant Partners relationship, which management has estimated to be 48 months.
Under both of the IFRS 15 transition options available, the impact of this change is not expected to be material to the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases This standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted.
TheGroup does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date.
When IFRS 16 is adopted, the two methods available to apply this standard are the fully retrospective basis, or the modified retrospective basis.
The fully retrospective basis requires the restatement of the comparative periods presented in the financial statements, whereas the modified retrospective basis allows the Group to assume the carrying amount of the initial right-of-use asset to be the same as the lease liability, meaning no restatement of prior years is required in the firstyear of adoption.
When the latter approach is applied, it is necessary to disclose the impact of IFRS 16 on each line item in the financial statements in the reporting period.
The Group intends to apply the modified retrospective basis whenadopting this standardon 1 January 2019.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 98 Financial statements 2.
Basis of preparation continued New standards and interpretations not yet adopted continued IFRS 16 Leases continued IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and will primarily change lease accounting, with lessor accounting under IFRS 16 expected to be similar to lessor accounting under IAS 17.
Lessee accounting under IFRS 16 will be similar in many respects to IAS 17 accounting for finance leases, but is expected to be substantively different to existing accounting for operating leases.
Where a contract meets IFRS 16s definition of a lease and the Group acts as a lessee, lease agreements will give rise to the recognition of a non-current asset representing the right to use the leased item, and a loan obligation for future lease payables on the Groups balance sheet.
Lease costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability, which may impact the phasing of operating profit and profit before tax, compared to existing cost profiles and presentation in the income statement, and will also impact the classification of associated cash flows.
Management is still assessing the appropriate discount rates to be applied to each individual lease liability.
However, if the Group had implemented IFRS 16 on 1 January 2017, using an assumed discount rate of 5% for each lease liability, we approximate the impact on the 2017 Annual Report, using the modified retrospective basis would be as follows: Income statement Other administrative expenses would reduce by 6.7 million, due to the derecognition of the lease expense.
Depreciation expense would increase by 5.5 million to reflect the current year depreciation of the right-of-use asset.
Finance costs would increase by 1.8 million to reflect the current year unwind of the discounted lease liability.
Cumulatively, the above will not result in a material impact to operating profit or profit before tax.
The uEBITDA measure will, however, increase by 6.7 million due to the lease expense being replaced with depreciation and interest expense, both not being included within uEBITDA.
Balance sheet At 31 December 2017, a right-of-use asset of 28.6 million would be recognised as a non-current asset, along with a 25.9 million non-current lease liability and 5.7 million current lease liability.
The 3.0 million differential arises due to the current year impact on profit before tax 0.6 million, with the remaining balance being attributed to the present value of the lease liability, and the timing of lease payments with regard to leases incentives.
Cash flow statement The 6.7 million lease expense is reclassified from operating activities to financing activities.
As both uEBITDA and operating cash increase by the same amount, its uEBITDA will still closely correlate to cash generated from operating activities.
Operating segments The Groups businesses are managed on a geographical basis.
Selected financial data is presented on this basis below.
Accounting policy b Revenue recognition and deferred revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Commission Commission revenue generated from restaurants is earned and recognised at the point of order fulfilment to the restaurants Customers.
Commission revenue also include delivery fees, discounts and vouchers.
Payment card and administration fees Revenue from payment card and administration fees is recognised when the service is completed, in line with the revenue recognised oncommissions.
This is the point at which an order is successfully processed and the Group has no remaining transactional obligations.
Top-placement fees Revenue from top-placement fees is recognised over the period in which the service is rendered.
Connection fees Restaurant Partners pay a one-off fee to join the Just Eat network, which comprises an equipment fee and a connection fee.
The equipment provided is an order confirmation terminal situated at restaurant sites for the purposes ofcommunicating between end-user Customers and restaurants via the central Just Eat ordering infrastructure.
Equipment fees are deferred to the balance sheet and recognised on a straight-line basis over 36 months.
This is considered to be an appropriate time period as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the equipment.
The equipment connection fee revenue is payable on connection but deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over 12 months.
In addition, the Danish and French based Restaurant Partners pay an annual subscription fee.
Revenue in respect of subscription fees is recognised on a straight-line basis over the annual subscription period.

Operating segments continued Accounting policy continued b Other revenue Other revenue includes the sale of branded merchandise to Restaurant Partners.
Merchandise revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the restaurant.
The Group has four reportable segments, which remain unchanged from the comparative year: United Kingdom, Australia & New Zealand, Established Markets and Developing Markets.
Established Markets includes the operations in Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland and Benelux sold August 2016.
Developing Markets includes Italy, Mexico and Spain.
Each segment includes businesses with similar operating characteristics and at a similar stage of development.
The principal measure of profit used by the CODM to assess and manage performance is uEBITDA.
The CODM is Peter Plumb, the Groups Chief Executive Officer.

The charge was driven by lower projected cash flows in the business plans resulting inmanagements reassessment of expected future business performance in light of the current trading environment.
The Australian market is unique in the Just Eat portfolio with a substantial part of the population living in Sydney and Melbourne.
This characteristic makes Australia an attractive market for competitors with the consequence that Australia is today one of our most competitive markets.
Furthermore, success is partly dependent on our ability to add delivery capability to complement our marketplace business.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 102 Financial statements 5.
Exceptional items continued Impairment charges continued The change in platform offers the businesses in Australia & New Zealand ANZ the potential to integrate with the SkipTheDishes platform.
Along with the additional security, scalability and stability that the new platform brings, this integration will be crucial to ensure the continued growth in the ANZ market through the addition of the logistics capability.
The technology built by SkipTheDishes allows forecasting of consumer demand, driver allocation and delivery times with very high levels of accuracy.
Whilst it will take time to deploy, it is this technology, when launched in Australia, that will place the business in a good position for solid future growth.
Whilst these initiatives are intended to create a much stronger business in Australia, IAS 36 Impairment of Assets prevents the Group from including these cash flows in the valuation of this business.
Consequently, an impairment charge of180.4 million against goodwill reduces the carrying value of the ANZ businesses to 302.2 million.
M&A transaction costs M&A transaction costs relate to legal, due diligence and other costs incurred as a result of the Groups acquisitions seeNote30 and aborted acquisitions.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, they include 1.3 million 2016: 6.3 million ofcosts in respect of the acquisition of Hungryhouse Holdings Limited Hungryhouse.
Acquisition integration costs The acquisition integration costs relate to the integration of recently acquired businesses into the Group.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, 9.0 million relates to accrued consideration separate to the acquisition consideration of SkipTheDishes management providing certain services to the Group post-completion.
For the year ended 31December 2016, the costs relate to the integration of Menulog and the four businesses acquired during the first half of 2016 La Nevera Roja PizzaBo hellofood Brazil hellofood Mexico.
They include the non-recurring costs of running two offices andplatforms during employee consultation processes, redundancy costs, lease termination costs and related advisers fees.
In addition, they include the cost of recruiting a new Menulog senior management team and advisers costs in respect of litigation and other matters that pre-dated the Groups acquisition of Menulog in June 2015.
Operating loss profit Operating profit or loss is stated after charging for depreciation, amortisation, long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items including impairment charges, foreign exchange gains and losses, and share of results from associates, but before other gains and losses, finance income and finance costs.

Taxation This note explains how the Group tax charge arises.
The deferred tax section also provides information on expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group, together with managements view on whether ornot they are expected to be utilised in the future.
Taxation is a key source of estimation uncertainty see Note 2.
Accounting policy b The income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case the income tax is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates prevailing in each respective jurisdiction and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
com 105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 10.
Taxation continued Accounting policy continued b Deferred tax continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax deductions on the exercise of share options Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, to the extent that the tax deduction available on the exercise of share options is equal to, or is less than, the cumulative share based payment charge calculated under IFRS 2, current and deferred tax is recognised through the income statement.
However, when the tax deduction is greater than the cumulative expense, the incremental current tax deduction and deferred tax recognition are recognised in equity.

Underlying profit is defined as profit before tax before long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, other gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, amortisation in respect of acquired intangible assets and share of results from associates below uEBITDA.
The total tax charge of 27.5 million 2016: 19.9 million is made up of: a current tax charge of 37.7 million 2016: 29.1 million, primarily consisting of corporate tax arising in the UK, Denmark, France, Ireland and Switzerland: and a deferred tax credit of 10.2 million 2016: 9.2 million resulting from the recognition of a deferred tax asset on tax losses arising in Australia and the unwinding of deferred tax liabilities arising on acquired intangibles.
As a result of the geographical spread of the Groups operations and the varied, increasingly complex nature of local andglobal tax law, there are some transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The provision held in relation to uncertain tax items totalled 17.4 million at 31 December 2017 2016:9.8 million.
Included within the total uncertain tax provision is an amount held in relation to an ongoing transfer pricing audit in Denmark.
In 2012, the transfer pricing arrangements of the Group were updated, in line with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, to reflect the commercial and economic reality of the Groups Headquarters being established in the UK.
An Advanced Pricing Agreement APA was submitted by the Group to the Danish and UK Competent Authorities to obtain certainty over the position taken.
The Danish Tax Authorities subsequently opened a local transfer pricing audit into the periods covered by the APA and in January 2018 issued a formal notice of assessment from their findings, making a claim that the taxable income for financial year 2013 should be increased, equalling an additional tax payment of 126 million, including interest and surcharges.
The Company strongly disagrees with the claim made by the Danish Tax Authorities and have appealed the assessment through a Mutual Agreement Procedure MAP between the UK and Danish Competent Authorities.
During the MAP, the two tax authorities enter into discussions with the intention of resolving the transfer pricing dispute.
Management believes that this issue will be resolved through the MAP, with the outcome being full elimination of the potential double taxation.
Such an outcome may result in a reallocation of income between the UK andDenmark with different tax rates applying over different time periods and net interest charges.
An amount has been provided in respect of this uncertain tax position.
This is a key source of estimation uncertainty as outlined in Note 2.
Underlying ETR is expected to trend towards the UK prevailing corporation tax rate.
However, the Groups future tax charge and actual underlying ETR will be driven by a few factors including: the timing of the recognition of tax losses, changes in the mix of business profits, local or international tax reform for example any arising from the implementation of the OECDs BEPS actions and EU state aid investigations, new challenges by the tax authorities or the resolution of ongoing enquiries raised by tax authorities and the impact of any acquisitions, disposals or restructurings.

Earnings per share The Group uses earnings per share to incentivise management.
The principal measure used is adjusted earnings pershare.
See the Report of the Remuneration Committee for further details.
Basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding unvested shares held pursuant to the Groups Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP and Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Diluted earnings per share was calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
The Group has potentially dilutive shares in the form of share options and unvested shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOP and SIP see Note 32.
Adjusted earnings per share is the main measure of earnings per share used by the Group and is calculated using an underlying profit measure attributable to equity shareholders, which is defined as profit attributable to equity shareholders, before long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, other gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share of results from associates below uEBITDA, and the tax impact of these adjusting items see Note 2e.

Goodwill The consolidated balance sheet contains a significant goodwill carrying value which arises when the Group acquires a business and pays a higher amount than the fair value of its net assets, primarily due to synergies expected to materialise.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Impairment of goodwill is a key source of estimation uncertainty seeNote 2.
Accounting policies b Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is obtained acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated toeach of the Groups CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
Animpairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of assets Under IFRS, the Group is required to test annually for indicators of impairment.
When an indication of impairment exists, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of FVLCD and VIU.
In assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
In assessing FVLCD, management apply an appropriate valuation method to determine fair value as if the asset or CGU were to be sold in an orderly manner to a market participant.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment charge is recognised immediately in profit or loss and included within exceptional items.

Due to timing constraints between the acquisition of SkipTheDishes on 14 December 2016 and the publication of the 2016 Annual Report, the prior year acquisition accounting was provisional.
The prior year valuation of the acquired intangible assets was based on estimated inputs.
In the current year, the valuation models and acquisition accounting have been finalised, resulting in an increase in goodwill of 1.5 million see Note 30.
Impairment charges at 31 December 2017 relate to the Groups ANZ business.
Accumulated impairment charges were 180.4 million 2016: nil.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of businesses and is attributable to the future growth of the acquired businesses, through expansion of their networks of Restaurant Partners and the number of orders per restaurant, anticipated future operating synergies, and the ability to leverage the Groups existing intellectual property in new markets around the world.
Inaddition, the goodwill balances represented the value of the businesses active Customer bases and assembled workforce, which do not meet the recognition criteria of an intangible asset.

Goodwill continued Goodwill allocated by CGU Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated on acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

Other CGUs include Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland and United Kingdom.
The individual amount of goodwill assigned to these CGUs is not considered significant in comparison with the Groups carrying value of goodwill.
Impairment review The Group tests goodwill annually for indicators of impairment.
When an indication of impairment exists, the Group reviews the carrying amount and recoverable amount of the investment.
The recoverable amount is the higher of FVLCD and VIU.
However, in line with IAS 36, FVLCD is only determined where VIU would result in an impairment.
The key assumptions used in the VIU calculations are the discount rate and the anticipated future cash flows which is afunction of increases in both revenue and in costs, along with other factors.
Thekey assumptions used in the FVLCD are similar to the VIU.
However, the assumptions are based on a likely market participants perspective when completing aDCF model.
In both the VIU and FVLCD calculations, management uses discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the particular CGU.
The assumptions on growth in future cash flows are based on past experience, recent results and managements future expectations.
The main drivers for future order growth are the continued investment in marketing, which helps drive brand awareness and drive Customer traffic to the Groups platforms, and the investment in technology, which ensures the platforms are stable, secure, efficient and scalable.
This investment ensures that both the relevant overall market as well as the CGUs market share increases over the medium to long-term.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board.
Management expects that some markets will enjoy a period of sustained high growth continuing from the end of the current budgetary cycle to maturity the medium-term.
A suitable medium-term growth rate, based on previous experience of growth rates including historical growth rates of all CGUs, has been applied individually to reflect each CGUs activity in this period.
Afterthis, a long-term growth rate is applied.
For the VIU, management typically forecast cash flows for periods up to five years, but there are some CGUs that are forecasted for longer periods.
These CGUs are located in immature markets which are currently lacking penetration, and where future investment in the business is expected to result in its long-term growth being achieved outside of five years.
Forthese CGUs, management believe it is appropriate to use forecasts extending beyond five years as they correlate with ourexperience in similar markets.
For the FVLCD, management typically forecasts cash flows up to 10 years, in line with what a market participant would likelymodel.
Management believe this to be appropriate as it is unlikely for a growing business cash flows to immediately drop to thelong-term growth rate after year five.

Pre-tax discount rates have been calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, the inputs of which include a country risk-free rate, equity risk premium, Group size premium and a risk adjustment beta.
Terminal growth rate is based on long-term inflationary rates in the country of operation.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, a non-cash impairment charge solely relating to goodwill of 180.4 million was recorded in respect of the Groups ANZ subsidiaries.
The recoverable amount of the ANZ CGU is 302.2 million, which was determined using the VIU method.
The charge was driven by lower projected cash flows within the business plans resulting in managements reassessment of expected future business performance in light of the current trading environment seeNote 5.
For all other CGUs, the VIU exceeds the carrying value of the CGU.
As a result, no impairment charges were required either in the current or prior year.
Sensitivity analysis For all CGUs, the recoverable amount was determined by measuring their VIU.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on each CGUs VIU which included reducing the anticipated future cash flows and increasing the discount rates.
With the exception of the ANZ and MX CGUs, no reasonably expected change in the key assumptions used in the VIU calculations would give rise to an impairment charge.
When sensitising each CGUs cash flows, a downside cash flow forecast is prepared by reducing the cash flows in each year of the forecast, rather than reducing the cash flows by a set percentage.
The above disclosure shows the decline of the forecasted cash flows in the final year of the forecast, before long-term growth rates are applied.
The sensitised discount rate of 14.2% if applied to the ANZ CGU would result in an additional impairment charge of 66.9million.
Thesensitised discount rate of 14.7% if applied to the MX CGU does not result in an impairment charge.
The sensitised cash flows applied in the ANZ and MX CGUs would result in additional impairment charges of 116.8 million and 21.8 million respectively.
In order for an impairment not to occur in Mexico, the sensitised cash flows in year eight would need not to fall below 61.9%.

Other intangible assets Other intangible assets predominantly arise on acquisition of subsidiaries or are internally developed.
Capitalised development costs is a critical judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies see Note 2.
Other intangible assets are amortised as well as being tested at least annually for impairment.
Accounting policy b Intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the assets useful economic lives.
The cost of intangible assets arising from a business combination or associate is determined attheir fair value on the date of initial recognition.
The Group has four classes of intangible asset: patents, licences and intellectual property IP, restaurant contracts, brands, and development costs.
Due to both the absence of a contractual arrangement and a practice of establishing such contracts with Customers, acquired Customer user lists are not classified as an intangible asset and remain as part of goodwill.
Patents, licences and IP Patents, licences and IP are generally acquired as part of a business combination, and predominantly relate to acquired operating platforms such as websites and apps.
Software licences are also included in this category.
The useful economic life is typically between three and five years, depending on the period over which benefits are expected to be realised from the asset.
The initial fair values are established as the estimated costs to replace the acquired platforms.
Restaurant contracts Restaurant contracts are generally the primary revenue-generating assets of a business combination and relate to the acquired contractual agreements between the business and the restaurants.
The useful economic life is determined as the period over which the acquired restaurant contracts are reasonably expected to transfer economic benefits to the Group, which is usually between three and ten years.
The initial fair values are established with reference to the present value of their post-tax cash flows projected over their remaining useful lives.
The cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are risk adjusted to the extent deemed necessary to accurately reflect local risks and uncertainties associated with the asset.
Brands Brands are acquired as part of a business combination.
The useful economic life is determined as the period of time over which the acquired brand is reasonably expected to transfer economic benefits to the Group, which is usually between three and ten years.
The initial fair values are established using the relief from royalty valuation method.
The cash flows and discount rates used in the relief from royalty valuation model are risk adjusted to the extent deemed necessary to accurately reflect local risks and uncertainties associated with the asset.
Development costs Internally developed websites, apps and other software, that together comprise the Just Eat ordering platforms, are capitalised to the extent that incremental costs can be separately identified, the product is technically feasible, expenditure can be measured reliably, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project.
Where these conditions are not met the amounts are expensed as incurred.
The useful economic life is typically three years, from the date the developed asset is available for use.

Investments in associates The Group holds an interest in associates where it has significant influence, with the most significant associate being IF-JEParticipaes S. A. IF-JE.
Accounting policy b An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but does not control or have joint control over those policies.
The considerations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except for when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
The investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost.
At the acquisition date, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the associate is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
Under the equity method, the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date.
The consolidated income statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of the associate.
Any change in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Groups other comprehensive income.
In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.

Available-for-sale investments The Group holds an interest in other unlisted investments where it does not have significant influence.
This predominantly comprises the investment in Flypay Limited Flypay, acquired in September 2016.
Accounting policy b Available-for-sale investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to fair value.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are taken to other comprehensive income, and then recycled through the income statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement within other gains and losses.

Inventories The Groups inventory comprises packaging materials and consumable items sold to restaurants, as well as JCTs and Orderpads held in the United Kingdom prior to their sale to other Group companies.
Accounting policy b Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises of direct materials.
Cost is calculated using the first-in first-out method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs tobeincurred inmarketing, selling and distribution.

Trade and other receivables The Groups trade and other receivables predominantly consist of the deposit paid to acquire Hungryhouse and other prepaid costs.
Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for bad or doubtful debts.
Accounting policy b Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
An impairment provision is created for receivables where there is objective evidence the Group will not be able to collect in full.

Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and their recoverable amount.
Theaverage age of the trade receivables as at 31 December 2017 was 76 days 2016: 74 days.
As at 31 December 2017, 31% 2016: 33% of the trade receivables were less than 30 days old, 18% 2016: 15% were between 30 and 60 days old, 7% 2016:7% were between 60 and 90 days old and 44% 2016: 45% were over 90 days old.
The Group has reviewed all balances and has made an allowance for debts which are considered unlikely to be collectable based on past default experience and an analysis of the counterpartys current financial position.
Allowances for bad or doubtful debts are recognised against trade receivables.
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, after taking into account the allowance for bad or doubtful debts, is approximately equal to their fair value.
At 31 December 2017, 1.1million 2016: 0.9 million of the allowance for bad or doubtful debts was in respect of receivables more than 120 days old.

Provisions for liabilities A provision is a liability recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount.
At 31 December 2017, the principal provisions held are in relation to contingent consideration on acquisition ofsubsidiaries or associates.
Accounting policy b Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.

As at 31 December 2017, only 20.2 million remains contingent, with 20.6 million reclassified within trade and other payables see Note 19.
The consideration is recorded at fair value, which is the present value of the expected cash outflows of the obligation level 3 measurement techniques.
It has been assumed that the business will perform in line with its current business plans.
The discount rate applied to the obligation was 1.73%.

Provisions for liabilities continued Contingent consideration in respect of the SkipTheDishes acquisition continued A 10% increase in revenue would have no impact on the provision, as the contingent consideration is capped.
A 10% decrease in revenue would also have no impact, due to budgeted revenue expected to significantly exceed the earn-out target.
A 0.5% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase the liability by 0.2 million.
Changes in the discount rate do not impact the Groups estimate of the final consideration payable.
Movements in the provision are recognised within other gains and losses.
Buy-out of FBA Invest SaS minority shareholder At 31 December 2017, other provisions included 9.6 million 2016: 9.1 million in respect of the Groups commitment to buy out the minority shareholder of FBA Invest SaS and associated legal costs.

Other reserves The Groups other reserves have arisen from a 2009 pre-Initial Public Offering IPO Group reorganisation, treasury shares when the Group issued equity under its JSOP and SIP share schemes, and cumulative unrealised fair value gains on cash flowhedges.
Accounting policies b Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, aseither fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
Hedges of foreign currency exchange risk where there is a firm commitment of a cash inflow or outflow are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Fair value hedges The Group did not designate any hedges as fair value hedges during the current or prior years.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in other gains and losses.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement inthe periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit or loss.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the profit or loss and is included in other gains and losses.

Merger reserve In July 2009 a Group reorganisation was undertaken.
Under this reorganisation, Ordinary shares were issued and cancelled and Preference A shares were issued.
This was treated as a common control transaction under IFRS as the ultimate shareholders and their relative rights were the same before and afterwards.
This reserve represents the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued and the nominal value of the shares on the Group reorganisation in July 2009.
The balance of this account has not changed and remains at 1.9 million as at 31 December 2017.
Treasury shares reserve This reserve arose when the Group issued equity share capital under its JSOP and SIP, which are held in trust by the Trustee of one of the Groups Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs.

Acquisitions In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group did not complete any acquisitions.
The note below provides the known details of the Hungryhouse acquisition completed 31 January 2018 and an update on the final acquisition accounting for SkipTheDishes completed 14December 2016.
Accounting policy b Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued bythe Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The Groups acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred and included within exceptional items.
Acquisition costs paid on behalf of the vendor are included in the fair value of consideration transferred.
When the consideration for the acquisition includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is included as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination.
Where the contingent amount is dependent on future employment, it is recognised as an expense over the relevant period in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date the Group obtains control and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for certain items which are measured in accordance with the relevant IFRS.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period.
Additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Acquisition of Hungryhouse On 15 December 2016, the Group announced that it had agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Hungryhouse from Delivery Hero Holding GmbH.
Approval from the Competition and Markets Authority CMA was obtained on 16 November 2017 and completion of the acquisition occurred on 31 January 2018.
Consideration transferred has provisionally been calculated to be 240.0 million, which includes: m Cash deposit paid in 2016 6.0 Cash paid on completion 210.0 Estimated deferred consideration payable 24.0 Estimated total consideration 240.0 Funding for the acquisition was obtained from both existing cash and a 100.0 million draw down on the Groups revolving credit facility.
Estimated deferred consideration of 24.0 million with the balance net of any warranties ispayable 12 months after completion.
The acquisition is consistent with Just Eats strategic ambition to further its growth and increase its market presence inevery geography in which it operates.
Hungryhouse is an online food company operating solely in the UK, with a comparable business model to Just Eat.
The acquisition is expected to generate significant benefits for Just Eats Restaurant Partners and Customers.
It creates an enlarged Customer base for Restaurant Partners to access, whilst increasing the breadth of choice on offer to UK consumers through Just Eats platform.
The combination of the two businesses also generates compelling economic benefits of scale, with high operating leverage expected to drive material synergies post integration.
com 125 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 30.
Acquisitions continued Acquisition of Hungryhouse continued Due to the limited amount of time since the completion of the Hungryhouse acquisition, the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed.
Disclosures that are not able to be made consist of the acquisition-date fair value of each major balance sheet item, including contingent liabilities.
Goodwill is attributable to the future growth of the acquired business, through expansion of their networks of Restaurant Partners, the number of orders per restaurant, and the anticipated future operational synergies.
In addition, the goodwill balance represents the value of the consumer bases and assembled workforce, which do not meet the recognition criteria of an intangible asset.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, Hungryhouse generated revenue of 35.3 million and a loss before tax of 14.8 million.
Transaction costs incurred on acquisition, including the CMA process, have been separately recognised as an exceptional item in Note 5.
On 2 February 2018, management advised Hungryhouse employees of their intention to integrate the Hungryhouse business with Just Eat, with orders being diverted through the Just Eat platform.
Associated integration costs and capitalisable migration costs cannot yet be reliably estimated.
Acquisition of SkipTheDishes On 14 December 2016, the Group acquired the entire share capital of SkipTheDishes.
At31December 2016, the acquisition accounting was provisional as some of the inputs used in the valuation of the acquiredintangible assets were based on estimates.
At 31 December 2017, the acquisition accounting has been finalised with the following measurement period changes being applied during the current year: acquired intangible assets decreased by 1.8 million to 17.6 million: the deferred tax liability that directly corresponds to the valuation of the acquired intangible assets decreased by 0.3million to 3.7 million: and total consideration transferred remains unchanged at 108.4 million, meaning goodwill recognised on acquisition was 93.4 million.
At 31 December 2017, goodwill decreased to 91.8 million as a result of foreign exchange movements.
Net cash outflow on acquisition of businesses The net cash outflow on acquisition of businesses during the year ended 31 December 2017 was 0.4 million, which relates to deferred consideration paid during the year in respect of acquisitions made in previous years.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the net cash outflow of 154.7 million related to the acquisition of La Nevera Roja PizzaBo hellofood Brazil hellofood Mexico 97.8 million, SkipTheDishes 56.2 million and deferred consideration paid in respect of acquisitions made in previous years 0.7 million.
Operating lease arrangements The Groups operating leases mainly consist of the lease of office buildings and motor vehicles.
Accounting policy b Leases as a lessee are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group did not have any finance leases in either 2017 or 2016.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

Share based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation plans.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments, the value of the awards are measured at their fair value on the date of the grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on managements estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
With the exception of certain awards under the Performance Share Plan PSP, the fair value of the awards granted was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Accounting policy b Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value includes the effect of market based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payment reserve.
The total expense recorded in relation to the long-term employee incentives was 6.6 million 2016: 3.1 million, seeNote4 for a breakdown of this expense.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had the following equity-settled share based compensation plans in operation: Just Eat plc Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme EMI Scheme Under the terms of the EMI Scheme, the Board granted options to certain employees of the Group to purchase shares intheCompany.
Options are no longer being granted under this scheme.
Just Eat plc Company Share Option Plan CSOP Under the terms of the CSOP, the Board may grant options to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company.
The CSOP is an equity-settled share option scheme approved by Her Majestys Revenue & Customs HMRC and was established in 2011.
Under the CSOP, the Board may grant options over Ordinary shares in the Company to eligible employees.
The eligible employees to whom options are granted and the terms of such options are determined by the Board.
All employees were eligible to participate in the CSOP, including employees of the Companys subsidiaries, but not all grants are approved by HMRC.
The exercise price of options may not be less than the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant in order for the scheme to qualify as an approved HMRC scheme.
Vested options in the CSOP became exercisable on the Companys IPO in April 2014.
com 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 32.
Share based payments continued EMI Scheme and CSOP Options are exercisable at a price equal to the estimated fair value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
Options vest in stages over a three-year period commencing on a specified date which is typically one year after the date of grant.
Options are forfeited if an employee leaves the Group before the options vest and expire if they remain unexercised ten years after the date of grant.

Just Eat Share Incentive Plan SIP Under the terms of the SIP, the Board may award Ordinary shares in the Company at no cost to eligible employees.
The SIP is an equity-settled share option scheme approved by HMRC.
The shares vest after three years from grant.
Shares were granted under this scheme on the date of the IPO with a fair value of 260.0 pence and all awards outstanding vested on 8April 2017.

The SIP awards do not expire.
Just Eat Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP The JSOP is a share ownership scheme under which the employee and Estera Trust Jersey Limited, the EBT Trustee, hold ajoint interest in Ordinary shares.
Interests under the JSOP take the form of restricted interests in Ordinary shares in the Company.
An interest permits a participant to benefit from the increase if any in the value of a number of Ordinary shares in the Company over specified threshold amounts.
In order to acquire an interest, a participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the EBT Trustee, under which the participant and the EBT Trustee jointly acquire the shares and agree that when the shares are sold, the participant has a right to receive the proportion of the sale proceeds that exceed the threshold amount.
The vesting of interests granted to employees is subject to the option holder continuing to be employed by the Group.
Interests vest in stages over a three-year period commencing on a specified date, typically one year after the date of grant.
The fair value of interests awarded under the JSOP was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Awards are no longer being granted under this scheme.

Financial instruments Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities.
The fair values and carrying values held at amortised cost are set out in the table below.
Unless otherwise stated, the valuation basis is level 2, comprising financial instruments where fair value is determined from inputs other than observable quoted prices for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
There were no transfers between fair value measurement categories in the current or prior year.
Accounting policies b Fair value measurement The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The Directors consider the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate to their fair values.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Va luation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Group derecognises a financial asset or liability only when the contractual right that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and credit card cash received on behalf of Restaurant Partners.

For all financial assets and liabilities, the Directors approximate the carrying values to equate to their fair values.
Cash and cash equivalents are held by the Group on a short-term basis, with all having a maturity of three months or less.
Derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange forward contracts which are measured using quoted forward exchange rates that match the maturity of the contracts.
A vailable-for-sale investments are financial assets which are measured at fair value using level 3 measurements being valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable data.
See Note 16 for more detail on available-for-sale investments.
P rovisions for liabilities include contingent consideration of 30.0 million 2016: 40.8 million in respect of the SkipTheDishes acquisition and the increased 1.5% stake acquired in IF-JE.
Fair value of theconsideration is valued using level 3 measurement techniques, which are the present value of the expected cash outflows of the obligation.
It has been assumed that these businesses will perform in line with current business plans.
See Note 22 for more detail on contingent consideration provisions.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to shareholders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 24 to 28.
At 31 December 2017, the Group has access to a 350 million 2016: 200 million revolving credit facility RCF which remains undrawn and has an interest rate range of 0.75% to 1.35% 2016: 0.95% to 1.55% above LIBOR.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Financial risk management The main financial risks faced by the Group are market risk which includes currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board regularly reviews these risks and will enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups treasury policy approved by the Board, which provides written principles on foreign exchange risk and the use of financial derivatives and non-financial derivative financial instruments.
com 131 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 33.
Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued a Market risk management The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies and consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities were as follows: Assets as at 31 December Liabilities as at 31 December 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Australian dollars 146.0 320.1 169.4 13.0 Danish kroner 91.7 7.2 77.5 17.0 Euros 60.1 36.0 38.3 32.1 Canadian dollars 20.9 12.7 78.2 49.3 Swiss francs 10.0 6.4 4.6 3.1 US dollars 2.8 1.5 Brazilian reals 15.4 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is primarily exposed to the Australian dollar, Danish krone, euro and Canadian dollar.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% depreciation and 10% appreciation in pound sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency-denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group.
Impact on income statement and other comprehensive income Appreciation in pound sterling Depreciation in pound sterling Income Income Income Income statement Equity statement Equity statement Equity statement Equity 2017 2017 2016 2016 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m m m m m Australian dollars 0.1 1.9 27.9 0.2 2.4 34.1 Danish kroner 0.3 1.0 0.3 0.2 0.4 1.2 0.3 0.2 Euros 1.6 0.4 1.6 0.9 1.9 0.5 2.0 1.1 Canadian dollars 0.5 5.7 0.5 3.8 0.6 6.9 0.6 4.7 Swiss francs 0.5 0.3 0.6 0.4 US dollars 0.2 0.2 0.1 Brazilian reals 1.4 1.7 The Groups sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currencies is the result of increased activity in the foreign-owned subsidiaries which has led to a significant increase in foreign currency-denominated trade payables, trade receivables andintercompany borrowings.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date.
Forassets and floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of asset liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 10% increase or decrease in the interest rate is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 10% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, there would be no impact on the Groups profit before taxation or equity 2016: nil.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued b Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its major counterparties are continuously monitored.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of Restaurant Partners, spread across geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which are stated net of impairment charges, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
c Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
In November 2017, the Group signed a 350 million RCF which expires in October 2022 with two separate one-year extensions.
The existing RCF of 200 million was then cancelled.
The new facility is unsecured and contains common financial covenants for the Company and its subsidiaries including: the ratio of total net debt to uEBITDA must not exceed 3.0, interest cover ratio of uEBITDA to net finance charges must not be less than 4.0, and any new earn-out deferred consideration must not exceed one times the uEBITDA.
The financial covenants are tested on a quarterly basis and have been complied with at all measurement points in relation to the old and new RCF.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had not drawn down on either facility.
The Group, however, drew down 100.0 million from the new RCF to assist in January 2018 to fund the Hungryhouse acquisition consideration.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity profile for its financial liabilities and has been prepared based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are a floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Contingent liabilities In October 2017, the European Commission announced that it will be conducting a State Aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption contained within the UKs Controlled Foreign Company CFC legislation.
The Group Financing Exemption contained within Chapter 9 of Part 9A TIOPA 2010 was introduced in 2013 when the UK CFC rules were revised.
Similar to other UK based international companies, the Group may be impacted by the final outcome of this investigation.
Whilst management notes there is considerable uncertainty in regards to both the final outcome of the investigation and any corresponding liability, the Group has calculated that the maximum potential liability would be 14.0 million should the European Commission conclude the Group Financing Exemption is in contravention of the State Aid provisions.
At this stage, it is the Groups view that no provision is required in respect of this issue and management will continue to monitor how the investigation develops.
Events after the balance sheet date On 31 January 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of Hungryhouse see Note 30. www.
