86 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation European law requires that the Groups consolidated financial statements for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 are prepared in accordance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
In the current period, the Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017.
For the comparative period, the Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the 53 week period ended 30 December 2016.
The Groups consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Preparation of financial statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.
This will also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements.
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company including all of its subsidiary entities after eliminating internal transactions.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included from the effective date of control using the acquisition method of accounting.
The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiary undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as at the effective date ofcontrol.
Exceptional items and underlying profit Exceptional items are of a non-recurring nature to the results for the period and are therefore presented separately.
In 2016, the exceptional credit is due to the changes to the headline rate of corporation tax used to evaluate deferred tax.
In arriving at the Groups underlying measures of profitability certain items are added back: profit or loss on sale of fixed assets: external transaction costs: amortisation of acquisition related intangibles: and exceptional items in respect of taxation.
External transaction costs External transaction costs, associated with completed or aborted transactions, refinancing or return of value to shareholders, are excluded from underlying profit as they are unconnected with the trading performance in the period and are therefore presented separately.
They relate wholly to external costs incurred by the Group.
Pre-arranged funeral plan trusts The pre-arranged funeral plan trusts are not consolidated during the period as they are not controlled by the Group.
Specifically, Article 60 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Regulated Activities Order 2001 RAO requires a majority of the managing trustees to be independent of the Group.
Further information can be found in the non consolidation of pre-need trusts note within critical accounting estimates and judgements below.
Revenue Revenue from funeral operations comprises the amount recoverable from customers for the provision of funerals, income from crematoria and other services, to the extent that those services have been performed or the goods supplied.
Revenues include amounts receivable from the pre-arranged funeral plan trusts for funerals performed by the Group for pre-arranged funeral plan members.
Income from memorial sales is recognised at the point of sale, to the extent that the goods have been supplied.
Costs of maintaining memorials are recognised as incurred.
The Group pays certain disbursements such as crematoria fees, burial plots, ministers fees and doctors fees on behalf of its clients.
These amounts are recovered as part of the invoicing process.
However, these amounts are not included within net revenues as they are simply passed on to the customer at cost.
Overview 01 03 Strategic Report 04 43 Governance 44 74 Financial Statements 75 129 Other Information 130 132 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 87 1 Accounting policies continued The accounting policies for recognising turnover for pre-arranged funeral plans are stated below.
The Group views the United Kingdom as one geographical segment, given each local business exhibits similar long-term characteristics.
All amounts are exclusive of VAT.
Pre-arranged funeral plans Trust plans The Group markets and sells pre-arranged funeral plans, with monies received from selling funeral plans being held and controlled by independent pre-arranged funeral plan trusts the Trusts.
The responsibility for the ultimate performance of funerals is allocated to funeral directors, who are selected by the beneficiary of the plan, some of whom are not owned by theGroup.
The Group receives monies from the Trusts in respect of the following transactions: A marketing and administration allowance in respect of each plan sold.
The marketing element is only refundable in the event that the plan is subsequently cancelled.
A provision is made for cancellations based on historical experiences, where material, to cover the estimated marketing element refundable to the Trusts.
Marketing and administration allowances are included in Group revenue when the related plan is sold less the provision for refunds arising on cancellations: and Further contributions are also received from the Trusts in return for the provision of general ongoing administrative services supplied to the Trusts.
These contributions are included in Group revenue for the period to which they relate.
All costs in respect of the marketing and administration of the pre-arranged funeral plans are expensed in the Group income statement as incurred.
From time to time, the Group receives monies from certain of the Trusts, in line with the relevant Trusts deed, which have been assessed by the Trustees as not required to ensure the Trust has sufficient assets to meet its future liabilities in respect of current members Recoveries.
All Recoveries are recognised as other income in the period in which the Trustees approve their payment.
The Group has not sought any Recoveries from the Trusts since 2012.
The Group makes payments on behalf of the Trusts relating to the ongoing overheads of the Trusts, refunds to members of the Trusts in event of cancellation, and the payments made to third party funeral directors when the funeral is ultimately performed.
All such payments are reimbursed in full by the Trusts on demand, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Trusts deed.
Neither the sales value of plans nor the costs of providing funerals are recognised in the financial statements of the Group when a pre-arranged funeral plan is sold.
Each Dignity marketing company contractually guarantees with the customer of a pre-arranged funeral plan that i if the customer chooses to cancel their selected funeral plan, a full refund will be made to the customer of all monies paid in respect thereof less in certain cases an administration fee payable to the relevant Dignity marketing company : ii the funeral directors services as selected by the customer will be provided regardless of price rises in the future: and iii for the majority of plans sold, specific disbursements such as crematoria fees, ministers fees and doctors fees will be provided regardless of price rises in the future.
Insurance plans The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies, in consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral including some disbursements of the plan holder at a discount to its rates prevailing at the time of death.
A commission is paid to the insurers when the policy is initially charged to the Group.
These costs are carried as a prepayment and charged to the income statement as a funeral is performed, with the cost per funeral estimated based on the total costs incurred and the expected level of policies where the Group will be involved in the fulfilment of the funeral.
This expectation is reviewed annually.
In the event of the death of the policyholder, if the Group performs the funeral, it receives an agreed amount from the insurers which is recognised as revenue within the funeral services division.
On occasions a third party will perform the funeral and the Group will pass on all monies received to that party.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
Management measures the fair value using the valuation technique that they consider to be the most appropriate to value each class of award, which include Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
The valuations take into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
88 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 1 Accounting policies continued An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight line basis, after allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually not vest.
The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed at least annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
When the options are exercised the Company issues new shares.
Earnings per Ordinary Share Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit on ordinary activities after taxation by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing profit on ordinary activities after taxation by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period increased by the effects of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares primarily share options.
Underlying Earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the underlying profit after tax by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Fair value measurement Other than in respect of items measured at fair value on acquisition of businesses and in respect of share-based payments, the Group has no assets or liabilities recognised at fair value.
The Group discloses fair values for financial assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date.
Fair value related disclosures are set out in note 26 in respect of fair values on acquisition of businesses and in note 21 in respect of financial instruments.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability measured using the assumptions that market participants would use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is capitalised and stated at historical cost less provisions for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The businesses and subsidiaries acquired are generally combined with existing operations in the year of acquisition, or the year thereafter and are therefore only considered to be separate cash-generating units during this time.
Intangible assets trade names Intangible trade names are recognised as assets at the estimated fair value of the consideration paid to acquire them and are carried at historical cost less amortisation and provisions for impairment.
When acquired as part of a business combination the fair value is calculated by reference to the estimated incremental cash flows expected to arise by virtue of the trade name being well-established.
Amortisation is provided from the date of acquisition so as to write-off the asset on a straight line basis over the term of its useful life.
During the period, the Group reconsidered the indefinite life assumed for its trade names.
Given the increasingly price competitive market and its impact on the business, the Group has concluded that an indefinite life is no longer appropriate.
Theestimate was updated in 2017 to a useful life of 35 years, applicable from 1 October 2017.
This resulted in an amortisation charge of 1.1 million in the period.
Intangible assets non-compete contracts Non-compete contracts arising from business combinations are capitalised at their fair value, which is calculated as the present value of any consideration paid discounted at the Groups cost of capital.
All costs are amortised over the term of the relevant agreement on a straight line basis.
Intangible assets software Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is treated as an intangible asset.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development of computer systems including websites is recognised if, and only if, the costs are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products, controlled by the Group and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives three to eight years using the straight line method.
Overview 01 03 Strategic Report 04 43 Governance 44 74 Financial Statements 75 129 Other Information 130 132 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 89 1 Accounting policies continued Investment in financial assets Investments in financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value with movements recognised through other comprehensive income unless there is objective evidence of impairment in which case the movement will be recognised through the income statement.
Intangible assets use of third party brand name The Group has a marketing agreement with Age UK Enterprises Limited, giving rights to market pre-arranged funeral plans under the Age UK brand.
The value of this right has been recognised as a separate intangible asset.
This asset is being amortised over 20 years on a straight line basis, recognising that each years additional marketing activity generates incremental revenues and profits to the Group for at least the following 20 years.
Intangible assets other As part of the Crematoria Acquisition in 2016, the Group acquired interests in two crematoria subject to finite periods of operation by way of lease and or service concession.
The fair value of these interests has been identified and recognised as a separate intangible asset.
The value of each interest will be amortised over the remaining period of operation.
Property, plant and equipment Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes, where appropriate, directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present location and condition.
Depreciation is charged so as to write-off the cost of assets to their residual value excluding freehold land and assets in the course of construction, over their expected useful lives using the straight line method.
The bases and annual depreciation rates in use for the various classes of assets are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% 10% Short leasehold buildings Over term of lease Motor vehicles 11% 20% Computers 20% Other plant and equipment 5% 33% Fixtures and fittings 15% Freehold land is not depreciated on the basis that land has an indefinite life.
Where the historical cost of land and buildings cannot be split, the Directors have estimated that the historical cost attributable to land is one third based on historical data of the original cost of acquiring the land and buildings.
This estimate is regularly reviewed.
Major renovations of the Groups trading premises and cremator re-linings are depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset or to the estimated date of the next major renovation or cremator re-lining, whichever is sooner.
Asset lives and residual values for each class of asset are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Assets in the course of construction are shown as work in progress at a value equal to costs incurred to date.
Once completed, they are reclassified and depreciated using the Groups depreciation policy above.
Borrowing costs If the construction phase of property, plant or equipment extends over a long period, the interest incurred on borrowed capital up to the date of completion is capitalised as part of cost of construction as permitted by IAS 23 Borrowing Costs.
Repairs and renewals All repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement unless they represent an enhancement to the original asset.
Property, plant and equipment held under leases When assets are financed by leasing agreements, where the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the Group, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and the corresponding liability to the lessor is included as an obligation under finance leases.
Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the income statement on the same basis as owned assets.
Leasing payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements such that the interest element is charged to the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding lease obligation.
All other leases are operating leases and the relevant annual rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis.
Profit or loss on sale of fixed assets Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within profit or loss on sale of fixed assets in the income statement.
90 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 1 Accounting policies continued Impairment of assets The carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life e. g. goodwill which are not subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
For goodwill this is considered at a business segment level as that is the level at which the return on assets acquired is monitored.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future discounted cash flows of the cash-generating unit are estimated, based on latest management expectations for the following year and an annual growth rate in subsequent years.
These cash flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital for the particular segment and compared to the carrying value of the relevant asset.
Any impairment in the value of an asset below its carrying value is charged to the income statement within operating profit.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Inventories Inventories, which comprise funeral supplies and monumental masonry, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred in completion and sale.
Taxation The tax charge for the period includes the charge for tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax charge represents the estimated amount due that arises from the operations of the Group in the period and after making adjustments to estimates in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, except where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to generate a net asset or liability if the conditions of IAS 12 are met.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Pensions The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to retained earnings in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions other than deferred tax are discounted where the present value of the provision is materially different to the undiscounted value.
The unwinding of discounts is included within finance costs.
Employee share trust The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the Directors consider that Dignity plc has fide facto control.
At the balance sheet date, the trusts assets and liabilities recognised in the Groups balance sheet within share capital and reserves were nil 2016: nil.
Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when paid.
Overview 01 03 Strategic Report 04 43 Governance 44 74 Financial Statements 75 129 Other Information 130 132 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 91 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Borrowings All borrowings are stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of transaction costs and subsequently at amortised cost.
The transaction costs, interest payable and premium on debt finance are charged credited to the income statement, as finance costs income, on a constant-yield basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where it is more likely than not that the lender will require earlier repayment, using the effective interest method.
Trade receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience.
When a trade receivable is not collectable it is written-off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously written-off are credited against administrative expenses in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on demand deposits and amounts included in accounts restricted for specific uses.
Critical accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgements in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts.
The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are detailed below: Provision for doubtful trade receivables Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired.
Within each division, assessment is made of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including the age of the receivable and the type of services provided.
The provision is assessed monthly against actual experience of irrecoverable accounts and adjusted if appropriate.
See note 21 c for further details.
Pensions The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that is accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group considers that the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the inflation rate.
See note 28 for further details.
Intangible assets trade names During the period, the Group reconsidered the indefinite life assumed for its trade names.
Funeral services goodwill impairment assessment Performing the annual impairment assessment for goodwill requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value-in-use calculation requires the use of estimates including those in respect of future cash flows, growth rates and an appropriate discount rate.
See note 9 for further details.
Critical accounting judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgements in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts.
The key judgements affecting the financial statements are detailed below: Non consolidation of pre-need trusts The Group markets and sells pre-arranged funeral plans, with monies received from selling funeral plans being held by independent pre-arranged funeral plan trusts.
These Trusts are not consolidated by the Group, on the basis they do not control them.
The principle of non-consolidation was established many years ago, and therefore the Directors consider annually whether there have been any changes to terms and conditions, or accounting standards that would change this determination.
IFRS 10, consolidated financial statements, was considered by the Group in 2015 with specific reference to the non-consolidation of the pre-need trust.
IFRS 10 consideration Analysis Power over the investee.
Power arises when the investor Dignity has no voting rights over the Trusts or any rights to has existing rights that gives them the ability to direct the direct the activities of the Trusts.
Whilst Dignity has the power relevant activities of the investee, being those activities to appoint or remove trustees, legislation requires the majority which influence the returns achieved by the investee.
of trustees to be independent of Dignity.
Whilst Dignity controls the charge levied to the Trusts for the provision of funeral services, it does not have the power to direct the investment decisions of the Trusts.
The investor is exposed, or has rights, to Dignity receives an allowance for the marketing of the plans and for the performance of a funeral.
From time to time Dignity may variable returns from its involvement with the investee.
receive a surplus from the Trusts.
Ultimately Dignitys return is wholly dependent on the investment performance of the Trusts.
The investor has the ability to use its power A majority of the Trustees are required, by legislation, to be over the investee to affect the amount of the independent of Dignity and therefore Dignity does not, and cannot, control the actions of the Trustees.
The investment strategy is set, implemented and monitored by the Trustees.
Consequently, Dignity does not have the power to affect the amount of its returns.
92 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 1 Accounting policies continued IFRS 10 built on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor on whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
In order to have control, IFRS 10 requires a parent company to have power over the investee, an exposure to variable returns because of its involvement in the investee and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the variable returns.
For new trusts acquired in the period, the Directors consider the terms and conditions to determine whether non-consolidation is appropriate.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2017 There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year that have a material impact on the Group.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted: IAS 7, Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7, effective 1 January 2017 and will therefore impact on the Groups 2018 annual report disclosures.
This standard requires disclosure so as to help users of financial statements better understand change in an entities debt.
The impact of the Standard is currently being assessed however, we do not expect any material changes in disclosure.
IAS 12, Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IAS 12, effective 1 January 2017 and will therefore impact on the Groups 2018 Annual Report.
IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers, effective 1 January 2018 and will therefore impact the Groups 2019 financial results.
This standard establishes a new five step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Theprinciples in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measure and recognise revenue.
The impact of this standard is currently being assessed.
This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will therefore impact the Groups 2019 financial results.
The impact of this standard is currently being assessed however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Group due to the nature of the Groups financial instruments.
Overview 01 03 Strategic Report 04 43 Governance 44 74 Financial Statements 75 129 Other Information 130 132 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 93 1 Accounting policies continued IFRS 16, Leases.
This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will therefore impact the Groups 2020 financial results.
Under the standard a lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
Approximately 50 per cent of the Groups properties are on lease terms that are currently accounted for as an operating lease but which will result in the recognition of both an asset and a liability under the new standard.
As the notes to the consolidated accounts demonstrate, the Group has total minimum future lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases of approximately 213 million.
Whilst the net present value of this commitment will be less than this amount, the grossing up of the Groups balance sheet that will be required to reflect this new standard will be material and will also impact on the Groups reported profit after tax.
The Group will be assessing this in due course, but notes that the accounting standard does not affect the cash flows or underlying economics of the business.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
2 Financial risk management The Group finances its operations by a mixture of shareholders funds, Secured Notes and bank borrowings.
This approach seeks to minimise financing costs and generate optimum shareholder value through efficient leveraging of the Groups balance sheet, which is made possible by the stable and predictable cash-generative nature of the business.
It is not the Groups policy to actively trade in derivatives.
Market risk Interest rate risk and other price risk The Groups main borrowings consist of Secured Notes, which are at fixed interest rates, resulting in a predetermined repayment profile.
The fair value of these financial instruments is based on underlying gilt prices and yield spreads based on the markets current view of the risk profile of the Secured Notes.
Consequently, the fair value of these instruments will fluctuate.
Fair values are not relevant to the Group unless it was to change its funding strategy and repay the Secured Notes early.
The Group has significant cash balances that are held by institutions with a long-term rating of at least BBB by Standard & Poors and BBB by Fitch.
These balances earn interest by reference to the Bank of England base rate.
If interest rates reduced by one per cent at the beginning of 2017 then the Group would receive 0.1 million less interest income on an annualised basis for each 10.0 million held.
None of the Groups other financial liabilities or financial assets carry any significant interest rate risk.
Credit risk Trade receivables are the main source of credit risk to the Group.
However, this risk is minimised as much as possible through well-established credit control procedures.
Quantitative disclosures regarding the ageing of these receivables are included in note 21 c. Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash reserves, committed undrawn borrowing facilities and regularmonitoring and forecasting of cash balances.
In addition, the Group is required under the terms of its secured borrowings to maintain a precisely defined EBITDA to total debt service ratio of at least 1.5 times in respect of the securitisation group.
This ratio was determined when raising the debt as being sufficient to ensure all borrowings could be repaid.
This covenant test has been satisfied on each quarterly testing date in the period.
At 29 December 2017 the actual ratio was 3.24times 2016: 3.37 times.
Capital risk management The Groups objective under managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and repay holders of Secured Notes.
It also aims to reduce its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
The Groups capital comprises equity and net debt as set out in note 24.
The Groups principal source of long-term debt financing is the Secured Notes, rated A and BBB respectively by Standard & Poors and Fitch.
The Group monitors its capital structure based on the ratio of gross debt, as summarised in note 24, to underlying earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or issue further Class A and B Secured Notes.
During the period, the Group achieved its covenants for the Secured Notes under the terms of the Groups secured borrowings see Liquidity risk above.
94 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 3 Revenue and segmental analysis Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
The chief operating decision maker of the Group has been identified as the four Executive Directors.
The Group has three reporting segments, funeral services, crematoria and pre-arranged funeral plans.
The Group also reports central overheads, which comprise unallocated central expenses.
Funeral services relate to the provision of funerals and ancillary items, such as memorials and floral tributes.
Crematoria services relate to cremation services and the sale of memorials and burial plots at the Dignity operated crematoria and cemeteries.
Pre-arranged funeral plans represent the sale of funerals in advance to customers wishing to make their own funeral arrangements and the marketing and administration costs associated with making such sales.
Substantially all Group revenue is derived from, and substantially all of the Groups net assets and liabilities are located in, the United Kingdom and Channel Islands and relates to services provided.
Overseas transactions are not material.
Underlying operating profit is stated before profit or loss on sale of fixed assets, external transaction costs, amortisation of acquisition related intangibles and exceptional items in respect of taxation collectively Non-underlying items.

See Financial Review for further details.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 20 per cent to 19 per cent with effect from 1 April 2017.
The Groups underlying profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 17.7 per cent 2016: 21.0 per cent.
The current period effective tax rate is impacted by prior year taxation items of 2.0 million which are not expected to recur.
The Group continues to expect its effective tax rate to be approximately one per cent above the headline rate of corporation tax.
This translates to an effective rate for 2018 and 2019 of 20.0 per cent and 18.5 per cent in 2020.
The Group does not have any provisions for uncertain tax positions.
In the prior period, legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 18 per cent to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and so the deferred tax balance was calculated at the rates at which it is expected to be incurred.
As a result, the Group recognised exceptional tax credit of 1.8 million through its income statement and a debit of 0.3 million through other comprehensive income to reflect the one off reduction in the period of the Groups deferred tax position.
98 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 7 Dividends 52 week period 53 week period ended ended 29 December 30 December 2017 2016 m m Final dividend paid: 15.74p per Ordinary Share 2016: 14.31p 7.9 7.1 Interim dividend paid: 8.64p per Ordinary Share 2016: 7.85p 4.3 3.9 Dividend on Ordinary Shares 12.2 11.0 The interim dividend represents the interim dividend that was approved and paid in the period out of earnings generated in the same period.
The final dividend represents the final dividend that was approved and paid in the period relating to the earnings generated in the previous period.
Consequently, total dividends recognised in the period were 12.2 million, 24.38 pence per share 2016: 11.0 million, 22.16pence per share.
A final dividend of 15.74 pence per share, in respect of 2017, has been proposed by the Board.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the date of signing this report the total final dividend payment is approximately 7.9 million.
This will be paid on 29 June 2018 provided that approval is gained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 7 June 2018 and will be paid to shareholders on the register at close of business on 18 May 2018.
8 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been based on the profit attributable to equity shareholders for the relevant period.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of any dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares being those share options granted to employees under the Groups SAYE Scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups LTIP Schemes.
At the balance sheet date, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the LTIP Schemes are assessed, as required by IAS 33, and to the extent that the performance criteria have been met those contingently issuable shares are included within the diluted EPS calculations.
The Groups underlying measures of profitability exclude profit or loss on sale of fixed assets, external transaction costs, amortisation of acquisition related intangibles and exceptional items in respect of taxation.
These items have been adjusted for in determining underlying measures of profitability as these underlying measures are those used in the day to day management of the business and allow for greater comparability across periods.
Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is also a useful indicator of financial performance.

100 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Impairment tests for goodwill and trade names As described in note 1, goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.
For the purpose of this impairment test goodwill is tested at a business segment level as this is the level at which the return on assets acquired, including goodwill, is monitored.
The segmental allocation of goodwill is shown below: 29 December 30 December 2017 2016 m m Funeral services 165.6 155.4 Crematoria 55.8 55.8 Pre-arranged funeral plans 4.7 4.7 226.1 215.9 The recoverable amount of each segment is based on a value-in-use calculation.
The value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based upon the latest annual budget approved by the Board.
Key assumptions used to produce the annual budget are the estimated UK death rates based on historical death rates supplied by ONS, anticipated market share, mix and pricing based on actual experience and reflecting the announcements made by the Group in January 2018.
Cash flows for all segments beyond the initial 12 month period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.25 per cent 2016: 2.25 per cent, being an estimate of long-term growth rates for impairment review purposes only.
The cash flows for each segment are discounted at a pre-tax rate of 8.5 per cent 2016: 6.0 per cent.
In respect of goodwill other than in respect of the funeral services division the directors do not consider that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the value-in-use of the segment would result in any impairment of goodwill.
The headroom for the funeral services division impairment test under the current assumptions used is 123 million.
Thediscount rate would need to rise to 10.3 per cent, or the long-term growth rate would need to fall to 0.41 per cent for the impairment test to result in nil headroom for this segment.
On the basis of the above, the review indicated that no impairment arose in any segment 2016: nil.
In addition to the Groups annual goodwill impairment test, given that the Group has updated its accounting estimate during the period, such that the useful economic life assigned to trade name intangible assets is now a 35 year life, an impairment test is required in respect of these assets in the current year in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36.
The performance of this impairment test, which was based on the same cash flow projections and key assumptions as the goodwill impairment test set out above, indicated that no impairment arose in respect of any of the Groups trade name intangible assets.
Details of any securities over assets are disclosed in note 30.
Additional headings have been included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for property, plant and equipment in order to provide additional information on the different types of expenditure that the Group has incurred during the year.
Assets held under finance leases, which relate solely to leasehold land and buildings, have the following net book amount: 29 December 30 December 2017 2016 m m Cost 1.0 1.0 Accumulated depreciation 0.3 0.3 Net book amount 0.7 0.7 The Group had capital expenditure authorised by the Board and contracted for at the balance sheet date of 11.7 million 2016: 8.6 million in respect of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Management consider that leases greater than 50 years at inception are long leases.
The balance is expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
The leases expire at various times over the next 30 to 125 years.
b Deferred commissions The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies, in consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral including some disbursements of the plan holder at a discount to its rates prevailing at the time of death.
c Investment in financial asset During the period, the Group invested 1 million in a non-controlling interest in a business.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for doubtful recoverables.
For further details of the trade receivables past due and impaired refer to note 21 c. Due to the short-term nature of these balances, the carrying value is considered to be their fair value.

Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable recoverable within one year.
However, the Directors consider that it is not possible to quantify the amount because the level of uncertainty in the timing of events and have therefore classified the whole balance as due after more than one year.

Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
All assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost with the exception of the investment in the financial asset explained further in note 11.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

This facility may only be used to repay interest and principal on the Secured Notes in the event of insufficient cash to service these instruments.
The facility is subject to annual renewal.
However, if the bank providing the facility does not renew it, then the provider is required to place 55 million 2016: 55.0 million in a bank account, which the Group may access as if it represented a borrowing facility on the same terms.
The facility is available on these terms until the Secured Notes have been repaid in full.
In the prior period, 26.2 million related to a Funeral Acquisition Facility provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
It was a committed facility, capable of being drawn until March 2017.
During the period, the Group completed a refinancing of its Crematoria Acquisition Facility and undrawn Funeral Acquisition Facility.
These facilities have been replaced with a 50 million Revolving Credit Facility RCF, provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is secured against certain trade and assets held by legal entities outside of the Groups securitisation structure.
The facility is available until July 2021, with the option to renew, subject to the banks consent at the time, by a further year.
Themargin on the facility ranges from 150 to 225 basis points depending on the resulting gross leverage.
This facility remains undrawn at the balance sheet date.
Further details may be found in the Financial Review.
The remaining 5.0 million facility expires in October 2019.
These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.

These amounts do not represent sources of funding for the Group and are therefore excluded from the calculation of net debt.
The Groups primary financial covenant in respect of the Secured Notes requires EBITDA to total debt service EBITDA DSCR, in the securitisation group, to be at least 1.5 times.
At 29 December 2017, the actual ratio was 3.24 times 2016: 3.37 times.
These ratios are calculated for EBITDA and total debt service on a 12 month rolling basis and reported quarterly.
In addition, both terms are specifically defined in the legal agreement relating to the Secured Notes.
As such, they cannot be accurately calculated from the contents of this report.

28 Pension commitments Defined contribution plans The Group contributes to certain individuals personal pension schemes.
These contributions are accounted for as defined contribution schemes.
Auto enrolment A defined contribution scheme is used to address the Groups obligations for auto enrolment.
Both the employee and the Group contribute four per cent of pensionable pay.
The pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Defined contribution schemes 3.0 1.5 Defined benefit plan The Group operates a defined benefit scheme the Dignity Pension and Assurance Scheme.
A full actuarial valuation is being undertaken as at 6 April 2017 and has been updated to 29 December 2017 by a qualified independent Actuary.
After consultation with members of the defined benefit plan, the Group closed the scheme to new entrants on 1 October 2013 and employee contributions were increased to 10 per cent from 7 per cent of pensionable salaries, with the Group contributing the same amount an increase from 9.2 per cent.
The plan closed to future accrual on 28 February 2017, except for members of the LGPS sections who continue to accrue benefits.
The total monetary contributions paid by the employer for 2017 were 0.3million of which relates fully to contributions for ongoing service 2016: 1.4 million of contributions for ongoing service.

Scheme characteristic The scheme is a final salary defined benefit scheme which was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2013 and ceased future accrual to all members except those in the LGPS sections on 28 February 2017.
It is administered by trustees in accordance with its Trust Deed & Rules and relevant legislation.
Member contributions are fixed with the employer meeting the balance of the costs of providing scheme benefits.
The contributions payable by the employer are set by the Trustees after consulting the employer and in accordance with the funding requirements of the Pensions Act 2004.
Funding arrangements The Trustees use the Projected Unit funding method.
The last full triennial actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 6 April 2014.
At the time of approval of the financial statements, the deficit reduction repayment plan for the anticipated deficit on the April 2017 triennial valuation has not been agreed with the Trustees of the scheme.
116 | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2017 28 Pension commitments continued Funding Risks The assets quoted at 29 December 2017 are comprised as follows: m Assets held by investment managers 110.7 Balance of the Trustees bank account 1.2 Total 111.9 The schemes investment strategy is to fide-risk the assets relative to the liabilities over time using a dynamic trigger based fide-risking framework.
The approach taken relates the asset allocation to the Schemes funding position on a low-risk self-sufficiency basis.
The principles are to target to achieve full funding on the self-sufficiency basis by 2036: to reduce funding level volatility by reducing un-hedged exposures including the use of liability driven investments : and to monitor the progress in the funding level and to capture improvements by opportunistically fide-risking when circumstances permit.
The latter is achieved by switching investments from growth assets to matching assets as the funding level improves.
It is recognised that although investing partly in growth assets is necessary to meet the return expectations in pursuit of funding level improvements, this increases the risk of a shortfall in returns relative to that required to cover the schemes liabilities.
Investment return risk If the assets underperform the returns assumed in setting the funding targets then additional contributions may be required at subsequent valuations.
Investment match risk The scheme invests significantly in equities, whereas the funding targets are closely related to the returns on bonds.
If equities fall in value relative to the matching asset of bonds, additional contributions may be required.
Longevity risk If future improvements in longevity exceed the assumptions made for scheme funding then additional contributions may be required.
29 Pre-arranged funeral plans a Contingent liabilities and commitments Dignity Pre-arrangement Limited, Dignity Securities Limited and Advance Planning Limited are fellow members of the Dignity Group in the United Kingdom.
These companies have sold pre-arranged funeral plans to their clients in the past.
All monies from these sales are held and controlled by three independent Trusts, being the National Funeral Trust, the Dignity Limited Trust Fund and the Trust for Age UK Funeral Plans respectively the Principal Trusts.
Further details of the transactions can be found in the financial statements of these companies, which are available from 4 King Edwards Court, King Edwards Square, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, B73 6AP.
The Group has given commitments to these clients to perform their funeral.
The agreed amounts payable to either the Group or to third party funeral directors will be paid out of the funds held in the Trusts.
The majority of the Trustees of each of the pre-arranged funeral plan trusts are unconnected to the Group, as required by current UK legislation.
It is the view of the Directors that none of the commitments given to these clients, which are explained further below, are onerous to the Group.
However ultimately, the Group is obligated to perform these funerals in exchange for the assets of the Trust, whatever they may be.
Similar commitments have arisen following acquisitions of businesses, since 2013, which have sold pre-arranged funeral plans through similar trust based structures the Recent Trusts.
Only the National Funeral Trust and the Trust for Age UK Funeral Plans receive funds relating to the sale of new plans the Active Trusts.
b Pre-arranged funeral plan trust assets As noted above, the Group has given commitments to perform the funerals covered by the pre-arranged plans, regardless of whether or not the Trusts have available assets to fund the funeral.
The Group, therefore, has a potential exposure in the form of a reduced fee should the Trusts investment strategy, over which it has no control, fail to deliver an appropriate return or result in a fall in underlying asset values, or if the cost of delivery for a funeral increases at rates in excess of investment returns.
Overview 01 03 Strategic Report 04 43 Governance 44 74 Financial Statements 75 129 Other Information 130 132 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 117 29 Pre-arranged funeral plans continued The Trustees have informed the Group that they continue to take independent advice regarding the Trusts investment strategy.
As a result, it is anticipated that the investment allocation by class will develop further during 2018 and beyond, gradually resulting in a portfolio in the following profile: Example investment types Target % Defensive investments Index linked gilts and corporate bonds 22 Illiquid investments Private investments 16 Core growth investments Equities 22 Growth fixed income and alternative investments Property funds and emerging market debt 40 These developments in the Trusts investment strategy are expected to enhance investment returns in the longer-term for a broadly similar level of risk as that currently taken.
The strategy will, however, potentially result in greater volatility year on year in the reported value of the Trusts assets.
The Trustees have advised that the market value of the assets of the pre-arranged funeral plan trusts were approximately 940million at 29 December 2017 2016: 863.9 million in respect of 306,000 2016: 299,000 active pre-arranged funeral plans.
102,000 2016: 68,000 of the remaining active pre-arranged funeral plans related to those backed by Insurance Plans, as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, with the balance of 42,000 2016: 37,000 being plans arising from acquisitions.
The Trustees of the Principal Trusts are required to have the Trusts liabilities actuarially valued once a year once every three years in the case of the Recent Trusts.
This actuarial valuation is of liabilities of the Trusts to secure funerals through Dignity and other third party funeral directors and does not, in respect of those funerals delivered by the Group represent the cost of delivery of the funeral.
It is only in the event that there are insufficient funds within the Trusts to cover the cost of delivery to Dignity that the commitment would become onerous to Dignity as described in a above.
The Trustees have advised that the latest actuarial valuations of the Principal Trusts were performed as at 29 September 2017 2016: 23 September 2016 using assumptions determined by the Trustees.
Actuarial liabilities in respect of the pre-arranged funeral plan trusts have increased to 877.2 million as at 29 September 2017 2016: 839.7 million.
The corresponding market value of the assets of the pre-arranged funeral plan trusts was 904.5 million 2016: 831.5 million as at the same date.
Consequently the actuarial valuations recorded a total surplus of 27.3 million at 29 September 2017 2016: deficit of 8.2million.
The Group considers these to be prudent assumptions.
If the valuation had been performed using a discount rate equal to the long-term investment strategy target of the Trustees of inflation plus 2 per cent, then the valuations would have reported an aggregate surplus of approximately 160 million.
Nonetheless, the Trustees have advised that the Trusts hold assets of approximately 3,100 2016: 2,900 per active plan at the balance sheet date.
On average the Group received approximately 2,600 2016: 2,500 in the period for the performance of each funeral including amounts to cover disbursements such as crematoria fees, ministers fees and doctors fees.
The Trustees have advised that the Recent Trusts have approximately 17 million 2016: 19 million of assets as at the balance sheet date and no material actuarial surplus or deficit.
Transactions with the Group During the period, the Group entered into transactions with the National Funeral Trust, the Trust for Age UK Funeral Plans and the Dignity Limited Trust Fund the Principal Trusts and the Trusts related to businesses acquired since 2013 Recent Trusts and collectively, the Trusts associated with the pre-arranged funeral plan businesses.
The nature of the relationship with the Trusts is set out above and in the accounting policies.
Amounts may only be paid out of the Trusts in accordance with the relevant Trust Deeds.
Transactions principally comprise: The recovery of marketing and administration allowances in relation to plans sold net of cancellations which are recognised by the Group as revenue within the pre-arranged funeral plan division at the time of the sale : and Receipts from the Trusts in respect of funerals provided which are recognised by the Group as revenue within the funeral division when the funeral is performed.
Transactions also include: Receipts from the Trusts in respect of cancellations by existing members: Reimbursement by the Trusts of expenses paid by the Group on behalf of the respective Trusts: and The payment of realised surpluses generated by the Trust funds as and when the Trustees sanction such payments.
