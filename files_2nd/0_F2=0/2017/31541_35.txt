EPRA performance measures This note sets out two performance measures of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA, calculated in accordance with their Best Practices Recommendations BPR.
These measures are intended to provide comparability and are explained in detail below: EPRA earnings see note 3a : For investors of real estate companies, a key measure of ongoing operational performance and the extent to which dividend payments are underpinned by earnings is the level of income arising from operational activities.
EPRA earnings exclude unrealised valuation movements and profits on disposal to provide an indicator of the leasing and property management performance of a business.
Adjusted EPRA earnings see note 3a : Whilst EPRA earnings provides a comparable measure for investors, it is not a relevant measure for housebuilders as it excludes all profits from such activity.
On the basis that these profits are realised in cash and represent a core ongoing activity for the Group, a company specific adjustment is made to EPRA earnings in respect of this profit.
Furthermore, the amortisation of loan arrangement fees represents a non-cash interest charge on an ongoing basis and therefore a further company specific adjustment is made for this.
After adjusting these two items for tax, EPRA earnings can be reconciled to adjusted EPRA earnings, which provides a relevant cash-based profit measure that underpins the dividend policy of the Group.
EPRA net asset value see note 3b : The objective of EPRA net asset value is to highlight the fair value of net assets on an ongoing, long-term basis.
Assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in normal circumstances such as the fair value of derivative financial instruments and deferred taxes on property valuation surpluses are therefore excluded, which facilitates a more objective comparison with peer companies.
Adjusted EPRA earnings Adjusted EPRA earnings is calculated as set out below: 2017 2016 Joint ventures Joint ventures Group and associates Total Group and associates Total m m m m m m Profit for the year 68.6 8.5 60.1 81.8 28.2 53.6 Less non-controlling interests 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.2 Profit for the year 68.1 8.5 59.6 81.6 28.2 53.4 Investment property revaluation gains losses 16.2 20.4 36.6 30.3 25.9 4.4 Gains on disposal of investments investment properties 6.7 0.7 7.4 9.5 0.5 10.0 Change in estimated cost to establish 1 a market in Nine Elms 24.6 24.6 2 Development profits 51.7 0.9 52.6 47.2 47.2 3 Fee income 3.8 3.8 2.1 2.1 Amortisation of discount on deferred 4 payment arrangements 0.3 4.9 5.2 0.4 5.2 5.6 Taxation in respect of profits or losses on disposal 13.7 14.2 27.9 9.0 9.0 Movement in fair value of financial instruments 1.1 0.8 0.3 7.2 0.4 7.6 Deferred tax in respect of EPRA adjustments 5.0 18.0 23.0 3.6 6.0 2.4 Non-controlling interests in respect of the above 0.4 0.4 0.1 0.1 EPRA earnings 7.8 5.6 2.2 2.6 4.0 1.4 Residential development profits 31.4 31.4 27.1 27.1 Amortisation of loan arrangement fees 1.8 0.4 2.2 1.2 0.3 1.5 Taxation in respect of company specific adjustments 6.3 0.1 6.4 5.6 0.1 5.7 Adjusted EPRA earnings 34.7 5.3 29.4 25.3 3.8 21.5 1 The change in estimated cost to establish a market in Nine Elms represents a loss on property development and therefore forms part of the profits or losses on sale of trading properties that should be adjusted in arriving at EPRA earnings.
2 Development profits exclude overheads directly attributable to the residential housebuilding business as these form part of the profits or losses on sale of trading properties that should be adjusted in arriving at EPRA earnings.
3 Fee income is included within development profits, but does not meet the definition of profits or losses on sale of trading properties and is therefore not adjusted in arriving at EPRA earnings.
4 The unwinding of discounts on deferred payment arrangements are linked to the disposal of either investment properties or inventory and are therefore adjusted in arriving at EPRA earnings.
