Underlying earnings is used by management as a measure of profitability within the Group.
Underlying earnings is defined as profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent for each financial period but excluding the post-tax effect of certain non-trading items.

The Directors believe that the underlying earnings before exceptional items and underlying earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
Underlying earnings is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.
