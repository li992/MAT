Going Concern The Companys investment objective, strategy and policy are subject to a process of regular Board monitoring and are designed to ensure that the Company is invested mainly in readily realisable, publicly listed securities and that the level of borrowings is restricted.
The Company retains title to all assets held by the Custodian and agreements cover its borrowing facilities.
Cash is held with banks approved and regularly reviewed by the Manager and the Board.
The Directors believe that: the Companys objective and policy continue to be relevant to investors: the Company operates within a robust regulatory environment: and the Company has sufficient resources to continue operating within its stated policy for the 12 month period commencing from the date of this report.
Accordingly, the financial statements have been drawn up on the basis that the Company is a going concern.
Financial Risk Management The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of publicly listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and Private Equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The significant accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice, and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value except as noted in d below and in notes 15 and 16 in respect of loans and the perpetual debenture stock.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities, including any derivatives, held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies, interest rates and other macroeconomic, market and financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Boards policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective are set out on page 11.
The Board meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in foreign exchange rates.
The debenture deed and loan contracts are agreed and signed by the Board and compliance with the agreements is monitored by the Board at each meeting.
Gearing may be shortor long-term in Sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.

Interest rate exposure The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risks at 31 December is shown below: 2017 2016 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Exposure to floating rates Cash 3,461 3,461 10,071 10,071 Exposure to fixed rates Deposits 27,675 27,675 16,392 16,392 Debentures 575 575 575 575 Other borrowings 50,000 241,362 291,362 246,998 246,998 Net exposures At year end 18,864 241,937 260,801 26,463 247,573 221,110 Maximum in year 18,864 241,937 260,801 100,540 156,074 256,614 Minimum in year 45,705 253,741 208,036 96,248 243,380 147,132 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Company arising out of the investment and risk management processes.
Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rate applying on the debenture stock is set out in note 16 on the accounts.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, except in respect of the debenture and loans see notes 13, 15 and 16, on which the interest rates are fixed.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates pertaining, at each Balance Sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates by 2% would have the following approximate effects on the Income Statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV: 2017 2016 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 69 69 201 201 Capital return Total return 69 69 201 201 NAV per share pence 0.01 0.01 0.04 0.04 78 78 || For Foreign & Colonial Investment T eign & Colonial Investment T rust PLC rust PLC OVERVIEW CHAIRMANS STATEMENT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT AUDITORS REPORT FINANCIAL REPORT NOTICE OF MEETING OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL REPORT 25.
Financial Risk Management continued Other market risk exposures The portfolio of investments, valued at 3,926,558,000 at 31 December 2017 2016: 3,432,682,000 is exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by country and major industrial sector is set out in the Fund Managers Review.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each Balance Sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV: 2017 2016 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement capital return 785,312 785,312 686,536 686,536 NAV per share pence 144.84 144.84 125.61 125.61 b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments, Private Equity investments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio over 450 at 31 December 2017 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio and the existence of ongoing overdraft and loan facility agreements.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 325 million as set out in notes 13 and 15 on the accounts together with an option to extend by a further 100 million.
The facilities limit the amount which the Company may borrow at any one time as a proportion of the relevant portfolio of investments and cash.
The most onerous financial covenant limits total borrowings to 35% of the Companys adjusted net asset value, which at 31 December 2017 was 3,441 million.
Actual borrowings at market value at 31 December 2017 were 295.6 million in loans see notes 13 and 15 and 0.4 million in a debenture at market value see note 16.
At 31 December 2017 the Company had 69.6 million outstanding commitments to Private Equity investments, payable over more than one year see note 22 b.

The Board reviews all counterparties used in such transactions, which must be settled on the basis of delivery against payment except where local market conditions do not permit.
A list of pre-approved counterparties is maintained by the Manager.
Broker counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
The rate of default in the past has been negligible.
Payments in respect of Private Equity investments are made only to counterparties with whom a contracted commitment exists.
Cash and deposits are held with approved banks.
The Company has an ongoing contract with the Custodian for the provision of custody services.
The contract was reviewed and updated in 2017.
Details of securities held in custody on behalf of the Company are received and reconciled monthly.
The Depositary has regulatory responsibilities relating to segregation and safe keeping of the Companys financial assets, amongst other duties, as set out in the Directors Report.
The Board has direct access to the Depositary and receives regular reports from it via the Manager.
To the extent that the Manager carries out management and administrative duties or causes similar duties to be carried out by third parties on the Companys behalf, the Company is exposed to counterparty risk.
The Board assesses this risk continuously through regular meetings with the management of F&C including the Fund Manager and with F&Cs Risk Management function.
In reaching its conclusions, the Board also reviews F&Cs annual Audit and Assurance Faculty Report.
The Company had no credit-rated bonds or similar securities in its portfolio at the year end 2016: none and does not normally invest in them.
None of the Companys financial liabilities is past its due date or impaired.
No derivative transactions were undertaken in 2017.
In 2016, the Company sold 32m of gilt futures and 21m of bund futures, realising a net loss of 95,000.
The maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and debtors equates to their carrying amounts.
