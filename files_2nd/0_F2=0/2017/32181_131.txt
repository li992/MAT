In addition, Johnson Matthey Plc has a revenue share agreement with CECC.
This agreement and the requirement for unanimous board decisions ensure that the group has a significant influence in CECC and so it is accounted for as an investment in associate.
In the parent company, the revenue share agreement is accounted for as a non-current available-for-sale investment note 21.

The parent companys investment is the revenue share agreement with CECC note 20.
