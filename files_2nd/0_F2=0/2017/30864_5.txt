Its great that Prudential offered me access to myDNA Pro, which has given me key insights into my genetic risk profiles.
The first step was to do a DNA test, which showed my body to be sensitive to carbohydrate and fat intake due to my genetic makeup.
Based on these findings, the personal health coach I chose as part of the programme helped me set a weight loss goal and plan to maintain a healthier lifestyle, including changing my dietary habits and ensuring I incorporated more cardio workouts into my exercise regime.
With these, I have been able to maintain a healthy weight and am now in an overall better shape.
Ive been very impressed by the geneticsbased recommendations and level of personal guidance provided by the programme.
Huge thanks to my coach and Prudential for all the support and motivation.
