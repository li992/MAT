Accounting policies Basis of preparation Renishaw plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in associates and joint ventures.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS.
The parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional currency and the Groups presentational currency, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies, that have a significant effect on the financial statements andestimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are noted below.
The Group identified a number of prior period adjustments during the year, resulting in a restatement of the comparative period in the 2017 financial statements, as detailed in note 25.
A third balance sheet has not been presented as the movements are identified in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Renishaw GmbH, Pliezhausen, Germany has chosen to exercise the right under section 264 sub-section 3 of the German Commercial Code HGB on exemption and preparation.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of Renishaw GmbH, Pliezhausen, Germany.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, subject to fair value items referred to in the derivative financial instruments note below.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied in preparing both the 2016 and 2017 financialstatements.
Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The areas of key estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgement that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities inthenext financial year are listed below: Critical accounting judgements i Capitalisation of development costs Product development costs are capitalised once a project has reached a certain stage of development and these costs are subsequently amortised over a five-year period.
Judgements are required to assess whether the new product development has reached the appropriate point for capitalisation of costs to begin.
Should a product be subsequently obsoleted, the accumulated capitalised development costs would need to be immediately written off in the Consolidated income statement.
ii Discontinued activities The closure of certain lines of business have been treated as discontinued operations on the basis that the directors are of the opinion that the underlying performance of the business is better reflected by classifying these items as discontinued.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty i Inventory Determining the value of inventory requires judgement, especially in respect of provisioning for slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory.
Management consider historic and future forecast sales patterns of individual stock items when calculating inventory provisions.
For most inventory lines, provisions are based on the excess levels held compared to a maximum three year outlook.
Where strategic purchases of critical components have been made, an outlook beyond three years is considered where appropriate.
The sensitivities around estimates vary significantly from line to line.
Accounting policies continued Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties continued ii Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values.
Theseinclude future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases.
Management makes these judgements in consultation with an independent actuary.
Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are given in note 14. iii Amortisation of intangibles and impairment The periods of amortisation of intangible assets require judgements to be made on the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets todetermine anappropriate rate of amortisation.
Future assessments of impairment may lead to the writing off of certain amounts ofintangible assets and the consequent charge in the Consolidated income statement for the accelerated amortisation.
Capitalised development costs are written off over five years, the period over which demand forecasts can be predicted with more certainty.
iv Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values see note 10.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, theGroup takes into consideration potential voting rights that are exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Application of the equity method to associates and joint ventures Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only tothe extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
New, revised or changes to existing accounting standards The following accounting standards have been issued but are not yet effective and have not been applied by the Group: IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers This is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018.
The new standard requires the separation of performance obligations within contracts with customers and the contractual value to be allocated to each of the performance obligations.
Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.
The introduction of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the results of the Group due to the relatively straightforward contractual terms and conditions with customers.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments This is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018.
The introduction of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the net assets or results of the Group, but may result in additional disclosures.
IFRS 16 Leases This has a mandatory effective date of 1st January 2019.
The new standard will eliminate the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases and result in operating leases being treated as finance leases.
This will result in previously recognised operating leases being treated as property, plant and equipment along with a finance leases creditor.
The introduction of this standard will increase the value of property, plant and equipment and the finance lease liability on the balance sheet but it is unlikely to have a material effect on the profit in any year.

Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated income statement when the significant risks and rewards ofownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally the time of despatch.
Where certain products require installation, partoftherevenue may be deferred until the installation is complete.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, orthe possible return of goods.
Revenue from the sale of services is recognised over the period to which the service relates.
Where goods and services are sold as a bundle, the fair value of services is deferred and recognised over the period to which the service relates with the remaining revenue recognised ondespatch.
Foreign currencies Consolidation - Foreign subsidiaries results are translated into Sterling at weighted average exchange rates for the year, which is effected by translating each foreign subsidiarys monthly results at exchange rates applicable to each of the respective months.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies atthe balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at that date.
Differences on exchange resulting from the translation of overseas assets and liabilities are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Transactions and balances - Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the rates prevailing at the time, with any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements being included as an exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency differences arising from transactions are recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Hedging of net investments in foreign operations - Gains and losses arising on currency borrowings used to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the net assets of the foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive income and expense and accumulated in equity, to the extent that hedge accounting criteria are met and are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement.
Theeffectiveness of the hedging is tested monthly.
Foreign currency derivative cash flow hedges Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency rates relating to overseas sales.
The Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
Foreign currency derivatives are stated at their fair value being the estimated amount that the Group would pay or receive to terminate them at the balance sheet date based on prevailing foreign currency rates.
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income and in the currency hedging reserve, and subsequently transferred to the carrying amount of the hedged item or the Consolidated income statement.
Realised gains or losses on cash flow hedges are therefore recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the Consolidated income statement.
Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting in IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement are recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Deferred consideration relating to acquisitions is subject to discounting to the date of acquisition and subsequently unwound to the date of the final payment.
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, net of deferred tax.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless ofwhether those rights are separable.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred tothe Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
It is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or earlier if there are any indications of impairment.
The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
Impairment losses are recognised through the Consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets such as customer lists, patents, trade marks, know-how and intellectual property that are acquired by the Group are stated atcost less amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straightline basis over theestimated useful lives of the intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets included in the Consolidated balance sheet reflect the benefit derived by the Group and vary from five to ten years.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets research and development costs Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends and has the technical ability andsufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over five years and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Capitalised development expenditure is removed from the balance sheet ten years after being fully amortised.
Intangible assets software licences Intangible assets, comprising software licences that are acquired by the Group, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
The useful life of each ofthese assets is assessed on an individual basis and they range from 2 to 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost ofassets less their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years, Plant and equipment 3 to 25 years, Vehicles 3 to 4 years.
Impairment on non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that their carrying value may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated income statement to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets net realisable value and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or from the cash-generating unit to which it relates.
The present value is calculated using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset concerned.
Goodwill and capitalised research and development costs are subject to an annual impairment test.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses that are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
Overheads are absorbed into inventories on the basis of normal capacity or on actual hours if higher.
Warranty provisions The Group provides a warranty from the date of purchase, except for those products that are installed by the Group where the warranty starts from the date of completion of the installation.
This is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is given for a small number of products.
A warranty provision is included in the financial statements, which is calculated on the basis of historical returns and internal quality reports.
Discontinued activities Where a line of the Groups business is treated as a discontinued operation, the financial statements have been re-presented and restated where required as if operations discontinued during the current year had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as a profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the Consolidated income statement.
Alternative performance measures The financial statements are prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In measuring our performance, the financial measures that we use include those which have been derived from our reported results in order to eliminate factors which distort year-on-year comparisons.
These are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors in providing a basis for measuring our operational performance.
Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our performance see note 24.

Accounting policies continued Employee benefits The Group operates contributory pension schemes, largely for UK, Ireland and USA employees, which were of the defined benefit type up to 5th April 2007, 31st December 2007 and 30th June 2012 respectively, at which time they ceased any future accrual for existing members and were closed to new members.
The schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the group finances.
Pension scheme assets of the defined benefit schemes are measured using market value.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate ofreturn onahigh-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Remeasurements arising from defined benefit schemes comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on scheme assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any, excluding interest.
The Company recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit schemes are included in the Consolidated income statement.
The pension schemes surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the Consolidated balance sheet under employee benefits.
Where a guarantee is in place in relation to a pension scheme deficit, liabilities are reported in accordance with IFRIC 14.
Foreign-based employees are covered by state, defined benefit and private pension schemes in their countries of residence.
Actuarial valuations of foreign pension schemes were not obtained, apart from Ireland and USA, because of the limited number of foreign employees.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the Consolidated income statement represents the contributions payable to the schemes inrespect of the accounting period.
Accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days holiday earned during the year, but not yet taken.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic report, where also given are details of the financial and liquidity positions.
In addition, note 20 in the financial statements includes the Groups objectives and policies for managing its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources at its disposal and the directors have considered the current financial projections.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report and accounts.
Taxation Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement except tothe extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Government grants Government grants, comprising R&D tax credits are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as a deduction against expenditure.
Pension scheme cash escrow account The Company holds a pension scheme escrow account as part of the security given for the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
This account is shown within current assets in the Consolidated balance sheet as it may be used to settle pension scheme liabilities immediately upon enforcement of the charge over the account.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term with an original maturity of less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated statement of cash flow.
Segmental analysis Renishaw manages its operations in two segments, comprising metrology and healthcare products.
The results of these segments are regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
The Group evaluates performance of the segments on the basis of profit before interest, tax and discontinued operations.
Within the operating segment of metrology, there are multiple product offerings with similar economic characteristics, and where the nature of the products and production processes and their customer base are similar.
More details of the Groups products and services are given in the Strategic report.

Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on earnings of 102,886,000 2016: 52,244,000 and on 72,788,543 shares, being the number of shares in issue during both years.
Basic and diluted losses per share from discontinued operations are calculated on losses of 13,931,000 2016: 4,024,000 and on 72,788,543 shares, being the number of shares in issue during both years.
There is no difference between the weighted average earnings per share and the basic and diluted earnings per share.

Income tax expense continued The tax for the year is lower 2016: lower than the weighted average of the UK standard rate of corporation tax of 19.75% 2016:20%.
Thedifferences are explained as follows: Restated 2017 2016 000 000 Profit before tax from continuing operations 117,101 61,703 Loss before tax from discontinued operations 15,142 5,019 Total profit before tax 101,959 56,684 Tax at 19.75% 2016: 20% 20,137 11,337 Effects of: Different tax rates applicable in overseas subsidiaries 1,886 2,653 UK patent box 4,025 423 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 310 266 Companies with unrelieved tax losses 1,960 461 Items with no tax effect 226 290 Prior year adjustments 3,037 860 Effect on deferred tax for change in UK tax rate 446 929 Other differences 107 359 Tax charge on profit 13,132 8,988 Effective tax rate 12.9% 15.9% The current year patent box benefit of 4.0m is significantly higher than the prior year as a result of favourable exchange rate movements.
Prior year adjustments totalling a credit of 3.0m arose primarily from the correction of a deferred tax liability held in respect of the currency translation reserve.
The Groups future effective tax rate ETR will mainly depend on the geographic mix of profits and whether there are any changes to tax legislation in the Groups most significant countries of operations.
Phased reductions in the UK rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1st April 2017 and 17% from 1st April 2020 have been substantively enacted which is expected to impact the ETR in due course.
Tax rate reductions are being considered in a number of countries where the Group operates.
The patent box benefit has a significant impact on the ETR and is unpredictable due to factors such as currency rate movements and the level of capital allowances claimed in any given year.
The Group does not expect the future tax rate to be materially impacted by the changes to the international tax landscape resulting from the package of measures developed under the OECD base erosion and profit shifting project.
Discontinued operations In October 2016, the Group decided to discontinue operations at Renishaw Diagnostics Limited healthcare segment and in June 2017, to discontinue the spatial measurements business metrology segment, on the basis of continued losses.
Certain assets of the business were sold.
Financial information relating to the discontinued operations is set out below: 2017 2016 000 000 Revenue 7,217 7,038 Expenses 13,914 12,057 Goodwill impairment 8,445 Loss before tax 15,142 5,019 Tax credit 1,211 995 Loss for the year from discontinued operations 13,931 4,024 2017 2016 Cash flow 000 000 Loss for the year 13,931 4,024 Adjustments for operating activities 12,155 635 Cash flows used in operating activities 1,776 4,659 Cash flows from investing activities 420 168 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents from discontinued operations 1,356 4,491 119 Financial statements Notes continued 9.
Therefore it is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists.
Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs, which are mainly the statutory entities acquired.
This is the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is monitored for impairment and is at a lower level than the Groups operating segments.
In the following table, only the goodwill relating tothe acquisition of R&R Fixtures, LLC is expected to be subject to tax relief.

These calculations use cash flow projections based on either the financial business plans approved by management for next five financial years, or estimated growth rates over the five years, which are set out below.
The cash flows beyond this forecast are extrapolated to perpetuity using a nil growth rate on a prudent basis, toreflect the uncertainties over forecasting further than five years.
Key assumptions The key assumptions utilised in the value in use calculations are: Discount rate The following pre-tax discount rates have been used in discounting the projected cash flows: 2017 2016 Discount rate Discount rate itp GmbH 12% 12% Renishaw Software Limited 12% 12% R&R Fixtures, LLC 12% 12% Renishaw Mayfield S. A.
15% 15% Forecast cash flows and future growth rates 2017 2016 Basis of forecast Basis of forecast itp GmbH 5% growth rate 5% growth rate Renishaw Software Limited 5% growth rate 5% growth rate R&R Fixtures, LLC 5 year business plan 5 year business plan Renishaw Mayfield S. A.
5 year business plan 5 year business plan These forecast cash flows are considered prudent estimates based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance of the individual CGUs and are calculated at a disaggregated level.
The key judgement within these business plans is the forecasting of revenue growth, given that the cost bases of the businesses can be flexed in line with revenue performance.
The average growth rates included in the significant CGUs business plans are as follows: 2017 2016 Average revenue Average revenue growth growth R&R Fixtures, LLC 14% 13% These business plans are recognised as key inputs to the impairment calculation.
They are monitored by management regularly and updated for expected variances in future performance.
Sensitivity to key assumptions Management have performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions detailed above.
122 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 10.
Intangible assets continued Discount rate An increase of 5% in the discount rate would not result in an impairment on any of the CGUs.
Management believe any increase in discount rates above 5% to be remote.
Forecast cash flows and future growth rates Given the average revenue growth assumptions included in the five-year business plans, managements sensitivity analysis involves a reduction of 10% in the forecast cash flows utilised in those business plans and therefore into perpetuity.
For there to be an impairment there would need to be a reduction of 44% for R&R Fixtures, LLC.
Management deem the likelihood of this reduction to be remote.

Employee benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
As noted in the accounting policies, actuarial valuations of foreign pension schemes are not obtained for the most part because of the limited number of foreign employees.
The major scheme, which covers the UK-based employees, was of the defined benefit type.
This scheme, along with the Ireland and USA defined benefit schemes, has ceased any future accrual for current members and these schemes are closed to new members.
UK, Ireland andUSA employees are now covered by defined contribution schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme was carried out as at September 2015 and updated to 30th June 2017 by aqualified independent actuary.
The mortality assumption used for 2017 is S2PMA and S2PFA tables, CMI core 2016 model with long-term improvements of 1% per annum.
Note C. 36 gives the analysis of the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
For the other schemes, the market value of assets at the end of the year was 20,386,000 2016: 17,646,000 and the actuarial value of liabilities was 24,312,000 2016: 23,348,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is around 24 years.
For a sensitivity analysis of certain elements of the UK defined benefit pension scheme, see the Financial review section of theStrategic report.
Itis expected that contributions to defined benefit schemes for the next financial year will be at a similar level to the currentyear.
The movements in the schemes assets and liabilities were: Assets Liabilities Total Year ended 30th June 2017 000 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 149,227 217,050 67,823 Contributions paid 4,204 4,204 Interest on pension schemes 4,681 6,241 1,560 Remeasurement gain loss 19,028 20,636 1,608 Benefits paid 6,432 6,432 Balance at the end of the year 170,708 237,495 66,787 125 Financial statements Notes continued 14.

The Company has agreed to pay all monthly pensions payments and lump sum payments, and transfer payments up to a limit of 1,000,000 in each year Benefits in Payment.
A number of UK properties owned by the Company are subject to fixed charges.
One or more of the properties may be released from the fixed charge if on a subsequent valuation, the value of all properties under charge exceed 120% of the deficit.
The Company has also established an escrow bank account, which is subject to a floating charge.
The balance of this account was 12,850,000 at the end of the year 2016: 15,279,000.
The funds will be released back to the Company from the escrow account over a period of 6 years.
The agreement continues until 30th June 2031, but may end sooner if the deficit calculated on a self sufficiency basis as defined in the agreement is eliminated in the meantime.
At 30th June 2031 the Company is obliged to pay any deficit at that time.
All properties will be released from charge when the deficit no longer exists.
The charges may be enforced by the trustees if one of the following occurs: a the Company does not pay any Benefits in Payment: b an insolvency event occurs in relation to the Company: or c the Company does not pay any deficit at 30th June 2031.
Under the Ireland defined benefit pension scheme deficit funding plan, a property owned by Renishaw Ireland Limited is subject to a registered fixed charge to secure the Ireland defined benefit pension schemes deficit.
No scheme assets are invested in the Groups own equity.
The present value of projected future contributions under the new agreement relating to the UK defined benefit scheme exceeds the value of the deficit at the year-end, therefore, under IFRIC 14, theUKdefined benefit pension schemes liabilities have been increased by 16,200,000, to represent the maximum discounted liability asat30thJune 2017 2016: 15,400,000.

Currency translation reserve The currency translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign operations, offset by foreign exchange differences on bank liabilities which have been accounted for in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity on account of them being classified as hedging instruments.
Movements during the year were: 2017 2016 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 6,448 2,714 Gain on net assets of foreign currency operations 4,848 28,778 Loss on foreign currency overdrafts held for the purpose of net investment hedging 959 20,369 Gain in the year relating to subsidiaries 3,889 8,409 Currency exchange differences relating to associates 173 753 Balance at the end of the year 10,510 6,448 Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve, for both the Group and the Company, comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the valuation of forward exchange contracts which are effective hedges and mature after the year end.
These are valued on a mark-to-market basis, are accounted for in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, and are recycled through the Consolidated income statement and Company income statement when the hedged item affects the income statement.
The forward contracts mature over the next three and a half years.

Financial instruments The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
Fair value There is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the Consolidated balance sheet.
All financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost, apart from the forward exchange contracts, which are held at fair value, with changes going through the Consolidated income statement unless subject to hedge accounting.
The fair values of the forward exchange contracts have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future exchange rates, representing level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The IFRS 13 level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values.
The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
Credit risk The Groups liquid funds are substantially held with banks with high credit ratings and the credit risk relating to these funds is therefore limited.
The Group carries a credit risk relating to non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
An analysis by currency of the Groups financial assets at the year end is as follows: Trade receivables Other receivables Cash including overdraft 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Currency 000 000 000 000 000 000 Pound Sterling 8,122 6,520 11,544 12,819 142,493 102,149 US Dollar 41,751 37,183 745 667 45,149 34,733 Euro 22,784 20,757 3,117 2,504 37,744 37,823 Japanese Yen 16,343 15,195 386 391 16,366 17,946 Other 48,507 35,290 3,195 2,606 8,708 9,656 137,507 114,945 18,987 18,987 51,942 21,303 The above trade receivables, other receivables and cash are predominately held in the functional currency of the relevant entity, with the exception of 5,324,000 of Euro-denominated trade receivables being held in the Company, along with some foreign currency cash balances which are of a short-term nature.
Also, see note below on net assets and associated borrowings, regarding the holding of foreign currency borrowings by the Company in respect of its hedging activity.
The ageing of trade receivables past due, but not impaired, at the end of the year was: 2017 2016 000 000 Past due 01 month 16,836 16,033 Past due 12 months 7,746 5,345 Past due more than 2 months 5,577 6,998 Balance at the end of the year 30,159 28,376 129 Financial statements Notes continued 20.
Financial instruments continued Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 2017 2016 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 2,921 2,964 Changes in amounts provided 452 919 Amounts utilised 258 962 Balance at the end of the year 3,115 2,921 The maximum exposure to credit risk is 221,286,000, comprising the Groups trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative assets.
Liquidity risk The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid, which can change over time, affecting the Groups interest income.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately 400,000.
The market value of forward exchange contracts is determined byreference to market data.
The contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the year end were: Contractual cash flows Carrying amount Up to 1 year 12 years 25 years Year ended 30th June 2017 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 19,544 19,544 Other payables 33,972 33,972 Forward exchange contracts 56,732 25,261 22,114 9,357 110,248 78,777 22,114 9,357 Carrying amount Up to 1 year 12 years 25 years Year ended 30th June 2016 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 22,379 22,379 Overdraft 9,975 9,975 Other payables 18,345 18,345 Forward exchange contracts 70,639 19,987 22,801 27,851 121,338 70,686 22,801 27,851 The maturities of non-current other receivables at the year end were: 2017 2016 000 000 Receivable between 1 and 2 years 907 76 Receivable between 2 and 5 years 6,062 6,969 76 Market risk As noted in the Strategic report under Principal risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority ofsales being made in these currencies, but with most manufacturing being undertaken in the UK, Ireland and India.
Exchange rates and sensitivity analysis The Group has hedged a significant proportion of its forecasted US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen revenues and hence the impact on the Groups results resulting from fluctuations in these exchange rates against Sterling is lessened.
130 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 20.
Financial instruments continued The following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
2017 2016 Year end Average Year end Average exchange exchange exchange exchange Currency rate rate rate rate US Dollar 1.30 1.27 1.34 1.47 Euro 1.14 1.16 1.20 1.33 Japanese Yen 146 139 137 171 Average US Dollar forward contract rates 1.50 1.58 Average Euro forward contract rates 1.16 1.23 Average Japanese Yen forward contract rates 151 125 The Company has US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro forward contracts which mature after the balance sheet date.
The fair value of these contracts at the year end resulted in a loss carried forward of 43,040,000 2016: loss 56,460,000.
The nominal amounts of foreign currencies relating to these forward contracts are, in Sterling terms: 2017 2016 000 000 US Dollar 394,858 354,416 Euro 136,903 132,013 Japanese Yen 89,782 81,581 The Group classifies these forward contracts as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The forward contracts cover monthly revenues over the next three and a half years.
Further details are noted in the treasury policies in the Financial review section of the Strategic report.
For the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, if Sterling appreciated by 5% against the US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen, this would increase profit before taxation and other equity by the following amounts: Profit Other equity 000 000 US Dollar 5,415 5,646 Euro 3,181 948 Japanese Yen 494 1,809 Net assets and associated borrowings The Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were: Net assets of Currency Base borrowing subsidiary borrowing interest rate Currency 000 000 % US Dollar 74,532 49,975 0% Euro 59,323 42,880 0% Japanese Yen 24,042 19,998 1.25% The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
For the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries not hedged, a 5% change in exchange rates will affect reserves by approximately 6,100,000.
Capital management The Group defines capital as being the equity attributable to the owners of the Company, which is captioned on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base and to maintain a balance between significant returns to shareholders, with a progressive dividend policy, whilst ensuring the security of the Group supported by a sound capital position.
The Group may adjust dividend payments due to changes in economic and market conditions which affect, or are anticipated to affect, group results.
Operating leases The total of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases all of which relate to land and buildings in subsidiaries were: 2017 2016 000 000 Due in less than one year 3,375 3,165 Due between one and five years 4,994 6,239 Total future minimum lease payments 8,369 9,404 Lease payments recognised as an expense during the year were: 2017 2016 000 000 Total lease payments for the financial year 3,456 2,651 22.
Capital commitments Capital commitments at the end of the year, for which no provision has been made in the financial statements, were: 2017 2016 000 000 Authorised and committed 6,812 17,783 23.
Related parties Associates, joint ventures and other related parties had the following transactions and balances with the Group: 2017 2016 000 000 Purchased goods and services from the Group during the year 852 640 Sold goods and services to the Group during the year 12,450 8,573 Paid dividends to the Group during the year 310 310 Amounts owed to the Group at the year end 220 264 Amounts owed by the Group at the year end 294 411 Loans owed to the Group at the year end 4,966 4,366 There were no bad debts written off during the year 2016: nil.
Alternative performance measures Alternative performance measures are - Revenue at constant exchange rates, Adjusted profit before tax, Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted operating profit.
Revenue at constant exchange rates is defined as revenue recalculated using the same rates as were applicable to the previous year and excluding forward contract gains and losses.
2017 2016 Revenue at constant exchange rates 000 000 Statutory revenue as reported 536,807 427,224 Adjustment for exchange rate movements and forward contract gains and losses 51,978 2,614 Revenue at constant exchange rates 484,829 424,610 Adjusted profit before tax, Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted operating profit - These measures are defined as the profit before tax, earnings per share and operating profit after excluding gains and losses in fair value from the forward currency contracts which did not qualify for hedge accounting.
The losses from fair value of financial instruments not effective for cash flow hedging have been excluded from statutory profit before tax, statutory earnings per share and statutory operating profit in arriving at adjusted profit before tax, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating profit to reflect the Boards intent that the instruments would provide effective hedges.
The Board consider these alternative performance measures to be more relevant and reliable in evaluating the Groups performance.
