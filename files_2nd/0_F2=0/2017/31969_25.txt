It relates to services provided in the UK and is stated net of value added tax.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised as follows: Management and platform fees are recognised on an accruals basis as they fall due.
The Group earns fees on transactions entered into on behalf of clients.
The fee earned is recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction, being the date on which services are provided to clients and the Group becomes entitled to the income.
Adviser charges are made to clients for providing full portfolio management services and ad-hoc advice to clients on specific financial matters.
Revenue is recognised at the point at which an agreement is made to provide advice.
Renewal commission is earned on third-party agreements entered into on the advice of the Group's advisory services and is recognised on an accruals basis as it becomes due and payable to the Group.
Renewal commission was also previously earned from fund managers based on the value of assets under the administration of the Group held within their funds.
From 1 April 2016, as a result of the Retail Distribution Review RDR, any renewal income was passed entirely to clients with neither income nor associated costs being recognised, hence the decrease in the amount in the current period.
Interest income received on client money balances is the net interest margin earned by the Group and is accrued on a time basis, based on the client money balances under administration and by reference to the effective interest rate applicable.

In the case of the Group, the CODM is considered to be the Executive Committee.
In the current period, consideration has been given to the nature of the operating segments previously disclosed and it is the view of the Board and of the Executive Committee that there is in fact only one segment, being the Group a direct-to-investor investment service administering investments in ISA, SIPP and Fund & Share accounts, providing services for individuals and corporates.
It was considered that segmental reporting, as previously presented, did not provide a clearer or more accurate view of the reporting within the Group.
Giventhat only one segment exists, no additional information is presented in relation to it, as it is disclosed throughout these financialstatements.
The Group does not operate in more than one location and, as a result, no geographical segments are reported.
The Group does not rely on any individual customer and so no additional customer information is reported.

The Group aims to attract, motivate and retain high calibre employees by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages, which may be linked to the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for employees of comparable status, responsibility and skills.

A disposal of shares in a subsidiary company also took place in the year - see note 5.6 for further details.
In addition, the Group has disposed of a number of items of office equipment in the period, leading to a loss see note 2.3 for further details.
1.8 Tax Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

102 Hargreaves Lansdown Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 1.8 Tax continued In addition to the amount charged to the consolidated income statement, certain tax amounts have been charged or credited directly to equity asfollows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2017 30 June 2016 m m Deferred tax relating to share-based payments 0.9 2.0 Current tax relating to share-based payments 1.5 3.2 0.6 1.2 Factors affecting tax charge for the year It is expected that the ongoing effective tax rate will remain at a rate approximating to the standard UK corporation tax rate in the medium term, except for the impact of deferred tax arising from the timing of exercising of share options which is not under our control.
The standard UK corporation tax rate was reduced to 19% from 20% on 1 April 2017, and accordingly, the Groups profits for this accounting year are taxed at an effective rate of 19.75%.
Deferred tax has been recognised at 19% or 17%, being the rates expected to be in force at the time of the reversal of the temporary difference.
A deferred tax asset in respect of future share option deductions has been recognised based on the Companys share price as at 30 June 2017.
Factors affecting future tax charge Any increase or decrease to the Company's share price will impact the amount of tax deduction available in future years on the value of shares acquired by staff under share incentive schemes.
The Finance Act 2015 was enacted on 18 November 2015 and has reduced the standard rate of UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
The Finance Bill 2016 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 reducing the rate further to 17% from 1 April 2020.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2017 30 June 2016 m m Profit before tax 265.8 218.9 Tax at the standard UK corporate tax rate of 19.75% 2016: 20.00% 52.5 43.8 Non-taxable income 0.7 2.8 Items not allowable for tax 0.2 Adjustments in respect of prior years 1.7 0.6 Impact of the change in tax rate 0.1 Tax expense for the year 53.8 41.6 Effective tax rate 20.2% 19.0% 103 Hargreaves Lansdown Report and Financial Statements 2017 Section 1: Results for the year Notes to the Group financial statements incomestatement 1.9 Earnings per share EPS Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in free issue during the year, including ordinary shares held in the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust EBT reserve which have vested unconditionally with employees.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 1,213,461 at 30 June 2017 2016: 1,285,073.

Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
Share options are expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on managements best estimate of awards vesting and adjusted for the impact of non-marketbased vesting conditions.
Annual revisions are made to the estimate of awards vesting, based on non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Any gains or losses on sale of the Companys own shares held by the EBT are credited or debited directly to the EBT reserve and are treated as non-distributable profits.
Equity-settled share option scheme The Group seeks to facilitate equity ownership by employees, principally through schemes that encourage and assist the purchase of the Companys shares.
104 Hargreaves Lansdown Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information The Group operates three share option and share award plans: the Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE, the Hargreaves Lansdown plc Share Incentive Plan SIP and the Hargreaves Lansdown Company Share Option Scheme the Executive Option Scheme.
Awards granted under the SAYE scheme vest over three or five years.
Awards granted under the Employee Share Incentive Plan vest over a three-year period.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Scheme range between vesting at grant date and a maximum of ten years.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
There are currently no performance conditions attached to any options granted under any of the schemes, with the exception of the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP an executive option scheme, although options are forfeited in most circumstances if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

Prior to 15 May 2007, the Companys shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore, no readily available market price existed for the shares.
Since 15 May 2007, a quoted market price has been available for the Companys shares.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions as shown in note 1.5.
