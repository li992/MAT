BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2017 249 See Glossary Non-operating items Non-operating items are charges and credits included in the financial statements that BP discloses separately because it considers such disclosures to be meaningful and relevant to investors.
They are items that management considers not to be part of underlying business operations and are disclosed in order to enable investors to understand better and evaluate the groups reported financial performance.
An analysis of non-operating items is shown in the table below.

b 2016 includes a $319-million exploration write-back relating to Block KG D6 in India.
In addition, an impairment reversal of $234 million was also recorded in relation to this block.
c Restructuring charges are classified as non-operating items where they relate to an announced major group restructuring.
A major group restructuring is a restructuring programme affecting more than one of the groups operating segments that is expected to result in charges of more than $1 billion over a defined period.
Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 and since the fall in oil prices in late 2014, major group restructuring programmes were initiated.
The current restructuring programme, aimed at simplifying and improving the efficiency of operations across the group, commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014 and has resulted in cumulative non-operating charges of $2.6 billion to 31 December 2017, principally relating to redundancy costs.
d 2017 includes BPs share of an impairment reversal recognized by the Angola LNG equity-accounted entity, partially offset by other items.
2017 also includes the write-off of $145 million in relation to the value ascribed to certain licences in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as part of the accounting for the acquisition of upstream assets from Devon Energy in 2011.
2016 includes the write-off of $334 million in relation to the value ascribed to the licence in Brazil as part of the accounting for the acquisition of upstream assets from Devon Energy in 2011.
2015 principally relates to BPs share of impairment losses recognized by equity-accounted entities.
e 2017 primarily reflects the disposal of our shareholding in the SECCO joint venture.
f See Financial statements Note 2 for further details regarding costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
g 2017 includes the tax effect of the increase in the provision in the fourth quarter for business economic loss and other claims associated with the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program DHCSSP at the new US tax rate.
h In 2017 the US tax reform reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1 January 2018.
The impact disclosed has been calculated as the change in deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017, excluding the increase in the provision in the fourth quarter for business economic loss and other claims associated with the DHCSSP, which arises following the reduction in the tax rate.
The impact of the US tax reform has been treated as a non-operating item because it is not considered to be part of underlying business operations, has a material impact upon the reported result and is substantially impacted by Gulf of Mexico oil spill charges, which are also treated as non-operating items.
Separate disclosure is considered meaningful and relevant to investors.
