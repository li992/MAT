Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 143 Additional Financial Financial Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Strategic Report Information Statements Statements Performance Strategy Overview NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017.
The Group consolidates a subsidiary when it controls it.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee: rights arising from other contractual arrangements: and the Groups voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when theGroup loses control of the subsidiary.
Income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control thesubsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the noncontrolling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it: derecognises the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary: derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests: derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity: recognises the fair value of the consideration received: recognises the fair value of any investment retained: recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss: and reclassifies the parents share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets and other components of non-controlling interests at their acquisition date fair values.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
It is then considered in the determination of goodwill.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date.
If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant influence, but which it does not control or jointly control.
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method and are initially recognised at cost, including goodwill.
Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate.
The Groups share of its associates profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, and its share of movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income.
However, when the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the Group is obliged to make further payments to, or on behalf of, the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
When available-for-sale investment becomes an associate, the investment is re-measured to fair value and any gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified in profit or loss.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSOCIATES IN PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the purposes of parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted at cost.
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations when they are classified as held for sale or distribution.
Dividends from a subsidiary or an associate are recognised in the parent company financial statements when the parents right to receive the dividend is established.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The Group measures financial instruments, such as trading and investment securities, derivatives and non-financial assets such as investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 32.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes placeeither: in the principal market for the asset or liability: or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
FINANCIAL ASSETS INITIAL RECOGNITION Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, or available-forsale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition.
DATE OF RECOGNITION All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are not entered into with the intention of immediate or short-term resale and are not classified as trading securities or designated as investment securities.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
This calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisationprocess.
Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 145 Additional Financial Financial Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Strategic Report Information Statements Statements Performance Strategy Overview NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified in any other categories.
After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business, the Group enters into various derivative financial instruments including forwards, swaps and options in foreign exchange and capital markets.
Such financial instruments are initially recognised in accordance with the policy for initial recognition of financial instruments and are subsequently measured at fair value.
The fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models that take into account the current market and contractual prices of the underlying instruments and other factors.
Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when it is negative.
Gains and losses resulting from these instruments are included in the consolidated income statement as net foreign currency gain loss.
MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT INITIAL RECOGNITION When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, adjusted, in the case of instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, for directly attributable fees and costs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price.
If the Group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, then: if the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability i. e. a Level 1 input or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the Group recognises the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price as a gain or loss: or in all other cases, the initial measurement of the financial instrument is adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price.
After initial recognition, the Group recognises that deferred difference as a gain or loss only when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.
OFFSETTING Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the .
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, amounts due from central banks, excluding obligatory reserves with central banks, and amounts due from credit institutions that mature within 90 days of the date of origination and are free from contractual encumbrances and readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
BORROWINGS Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities, where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in the Group having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of own equity instruments.
Such instruments include amounts due to credit institutions and amounts due to customers including promissory notes issued.
These are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the borrowings are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
SUBORDINATED DEBT Subordinated debt represents long-term funds attracted by the Bank on the international financial markets or domestic market.
The holders of subordinated debt would be subordinate to all other creditors to receive repayment of debt in case of the Banks liquidation.
Subordinated debt is carried at amortised cost.
FINANCE GROUP AS LESSOR Leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the lease item to the lessee are classified as finance leases.
The Group recognises finance lease receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position at a value equal to the net investment in the lease, starting from the date of commencement of the lease term.
In calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments, the discount factor used is the interest rate implicit in the lease.
Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the finance lease receivables.
Lease payments received are apportioned between the finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease receivable.
Finance income is based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding.
OPERATING GROUP AS LESSEE Leases of assets under which the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in other administrative and operating expenses.
146 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 3.
SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED III.
OPERATING GROUP AS LESSOR The Group presents assets subject to operating leases in the consolidated statement of financial position according to the nature of the asset.
Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term as other income.
The aggregate cost of incentives provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Initial direct costs incurred specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
AMOUNTS DUE FROM CREDIT INSTITUTIONS, LOANS TO CUSTOMERS AND FINANCE LEASE RECEIVABLES For amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and finance lease receivables carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risks characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount based on the original effective interest rate of the asset.
Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the Group.
If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account.
If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to the consolidated income statement in the respective impairment line with a negative sign as a reversal of impairment.
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate.
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable.
For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the Groups internal credit grading system that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors.
Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group.
Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the years on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently.
Estimates of changes in future cash flows reflect, and are consistent with, changes in related observable data from year to year such as changes in unemployment rates, property prices, commodity prices, payment status, or other factors that are indicative of incurred losses in the group or their magnitude.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
WRITE-OFF OF LOANS TO CUSTOMERS All retail loans, except mortgages, are written off when overdue by more than 150 days.
Retail mortgage loans are written off when overdue by more than 365 days.
Write off of corporate loans overdue by more than 150 days is subject to management discretion and is evaluated on a case by case basis, taking into account the current and expected positions of the loan borrower.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS For available-for-sale financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost.
Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the consolidated income statement is reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement: increases in their fair value after impairment are recognised in other comprehensive income.
In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial assets carried at amortised cost.
However, the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the amortised cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Future interest income is based on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
The interest income is recorded in the consolidated income statement.
If, in a subsequent year, the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement.

SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED RENEGOTIATED LOANS A renegotiated loan is a loan for which the terms have been modified or for which additional collateral has been requested that was not contemplated in the original contract in response to a customers financial difficulties.
The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to the current or potential credit deterioration of a customer.
When the contractual payment terms of a loan are modified because we have significant concerns about the borrowers ability to meet contractual payments when due, these loans are classified as renegotiated loans.
Indicators of financial difficulties include defaults on covenants, significant arrears for 30 days or more in a three-month period, or concerns raised by the Credit Risk Department.
Typical key features of terms and conditions granted through renegotiation to avoid default include special interest rates, postponement of interest or amortisation payments, modification of the schedule of repayments or amendment of loan maturity.
Once the terms have been renegotiated, any impairment is measured using the original EIR as calculated before the modification of terms.
For the purposes of measuring credit losses within the collective loan loss assessment, these loans are not segregated from other loans which have not been renegotiated.
Management regularly reviews all loans to ensure that all criteria according to the loan agreement continue to be met and that future payments are likely to occur.
Loans subject to individual impairment assessment, whose terms have been renegotiated, are subject to ongoing review to determine whether they remain impaired.
Once a loan in the retail book is identified as renegotiated, it remains within this category until maturity or fide-recognition from the balance sheet unless the customer is able to cure the break by making six regular payments on time.
Corporate loans retain renegotiated loan designation until maturity or fide-recognition unless borrowers experience significant credit improvement during the remaining life of the loan.
Any new loans that arise following derecognition events will continue to be disclosed as renegotiated loans and are assessed for impairment as above.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FINANCIAL ASSETS A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset, or retained the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and the Group either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and or purchased option including a cash-settled option or similar provision on the transferred asset, the extent of the Groups continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option including a cash-settled option or similar provision on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Groups continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
FINANCIAL GUARANTEES In the ordinary course of business, the Group gives financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit, guarantees and acceptances.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value, in other liabilities, being the premium received.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Groups liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amortised premium and the best estimate of expenditure required to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee.
Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is taken to the consolidated income statement.
The premium received is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee.
INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The cost of inventory includes expenditure incurred in acquiring inventory and bringing it to its existing location and condition including borrowing costs.
The cost of inventory is determined on a weighted average basis for beverages and in healthcare, and on a first-in-first-out basis FIFO in the pharma segment.
The cost of inventory in the real estate segment is determined with reference to the specific costs incurred on the property sold and allocated non-specific costs based on the relative size of the property sold.
148 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 3.
SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset disposal group, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.
Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year from the date of the classification.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position.
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the statement of profit or loss.
Net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of cash flows.
TAXATION The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with the regulations in force in the respective territories in which BGEO and its subsidiaries operate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeablefuture.
Georgia and Belarus also have various operating taxes that are assessed on the Groups activities.
These taxes are included as a component of other operating expenses.
INVESTMENT PROPERTIES Investment property is land or building or a part of a building held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation and which is not used by the Group or held for sale in the ordinary course of business.
Property that is being constructed or developed or redeveloped for future use as an investment property is also classified as an investment property.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently remeasured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Fair value of the Groups investment property is determined on the basis of various sources including reports of independent appraisers, who hold a recognised and relevant professional qualifications and who have recent experience in valuation of property of similar location and category.
Investment property that is being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property or for which the market has become less active continues to be measured at fair value.
Earned rental income is recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for Banking Business companies and within real estate revenue for Investment Business companies.
Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property are recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for Banking Business companies and within real estate revenue or gross other investment profit for Investment Business companies, depending on whether the gains derive from active property development or passive appreciation respectively.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with it will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred.
If an investment property becomes owneroccupied, it is reclassified to property and equipment, and its carrying amount at the date of reclassification becomes its deemed cost to be .

SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment, except for infrastructure assets, is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment in value.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.
Infrastructure assets are measured at fair value less depreciation and impairment charged subsequent to the date of the revaluation.
Infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems consisting of raw water aqueducts, mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs and sludge pipelines.
Investment expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increase in capacity or enhancements of the network and asset replacements to maintain the operating capability of the network is treated as an addition and initially recorded at cost, whilst repair and maintenance expenditure which does not enhance the asset base is charged as an operating cost.
The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Following initial recognition at cost, infrastructure assets are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Valuations are performed once every three years, unless there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market.
Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve for property and equipment included in other comprehensive income, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in the consolidated income statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
A revaluation deficit is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the revaluation reserve for property and equipment.
An annual transfer from the revaluation reserve for property and equipment to retained earnings is made for the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the assets and depreciation based on the assets original cost.
Additionally, accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Upon disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Depreciation of an asset commences from the date the asset is ready and available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: Years Office buildings and service centres Up to 100 Infrastructure assets 10-40 Factory and equipment 7-30 Furniture and fixtures 10 Computers and equipment 5-10 Motor vehicles 5 The assets residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Assets under construction are stated at cost and are not depreciated until the time they are available for use and reclassified to respective group of property and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the related leased asset or the expected lease term if lower.
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when incurred and included in other operating expenses, unless they qualify for capitalization.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may beimpaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated: represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes: and is not larger than a segment as defined in IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit group of cash-generating units is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Impairment losses cannot be reversed in future periods.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Groups intangible assets include computer software and licenses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The economic lives of intangible assets are assessed to be finite and amortised over four to ten years and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Amortisation periods and methods for intangible assets are reviewed at least at each financial year-end.
150 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 3.
SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recorded as an expense as incurred.
Software development costs relating to the design and testing of new or substantially improved software are recognised as intangible assets only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete the asset and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the asset and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during the development.
Other software development costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES Insurance and reinsurance receivables are recognised based upon insurance policy terms and measured at cost.
The carrying value of insurance and reinsurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any impairment loss recorded in the consolidated statement of income.
Reinsurance receivables primarily include balances due from both insurance and reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities.
Premiums on reinsurance assumed are recognised as revenue in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business.
Amounts due to reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated reinsured policies and in accordance with the reinsurance contract.
Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a grossbasis.
An impairment review is performed on all reinsurance assets when an indication of impairment occurs.
Reinsurance receivables are impaired only if there is objective evidence that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract and that this can be measuredreliably.
INSURANCE LIABILITIES GENERAL INSURANCE LIABILITIES General insurance contract liabilities are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the reporting date, whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs and reduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries.
Significant delays can be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, particularly in respect of liability business, environmental and pollution exposures therefore the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the reporting date.
PROVISION FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS The proportion of written premiums, gross of commission payable to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as unearned premium.
The change in the provision for unearned premium is taken to the consolidated income statement in order that revenue is recognised over the period of risk or, for annuities, the amount of expected future benefit payments.
LIABILITY ADEQUACY TEST At each reporting date, a liability adequacy test is performed, to ensure the adequacy of unearned premiums net of related deferred acquisition costs.
In performing the test, current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from assets backing such liabilities, are used.
Any inadequacy is immediately charged to the consolidated income statement by establishing an unexpired risk provision.
PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of obligation can be made.
Provisions for the risk of incurring losses on off-balance sheet commitments are estimated regularly based on the past history of actual losses incurred on these commitments.
RETIREMENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group provides management and employees of the Group with private pension plans.
These are defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees of the Group.
The Group collects contributions in the size of 2% of full-time employees salaries, of which 1% is deducted from the salaries and the other 1% is additionally paid by the Group.
When an employee reaches pension age, aggregated contributions, plus any earnings earned on the employees behalf are paid to the employee according to the schedule agreed with the employee.
Aggregated amounts are distributed during the period when the employee will receive accumulated contributions.
Respective pension benefit obligations are recorded within other liabilities, Note 16.
Respective pension costs are recognised in consolidated income statement as salaries and other employeebenefits.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS Employees including senior executives of the Group receive share-based remuneration, whereby they render services and receive equity instruments of the Group equity-settled transactions as consideration for the services provided.
EQUITY-SETTLED TRANSACTIONS The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date when the relevant employee is fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The consolidated income statement charge or credit for the period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS CONTINUED No expense is recognised for the awards that do not ultimately vest except for the awards where vesting is conditional upon market conditions a condition linked to the price of BGEOs shares which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as the replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and the new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previousparagraph.
SHARE CAPITAL SHARE CAPITAL Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business combination, are shown as a deduction from the proceeds in equity.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
TREASURY SHARES Where BGEO or its subsidiaries purchase BGEOs shares, the consideration paid, including any attributable transaction costs, net of income taxes, is deducted from total equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in equity.
Treasury shares are stated at par value, with adjustment of premiums against additional paid-in capital.
DIVIDENDS Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the reporting date only if they are declared before or on the reporting date.
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the reporting date or proposed or declared after the reporting date but before the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue.
All expenses associated with dividend distribution are added to the dividend amount and recorded directly through equity.
CONTINGENCIES Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed unless the possibility of any outflow in settlement is remote.
A contingent asset is not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
INCOME AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expense are recognised: INTEREST AND SIMILAR INCOME AND EXPENSE For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest bearing securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, interest income or expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, prepayment options and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses.
The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or receipts.
The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense.
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount.
FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME The Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of services it provides to its customers.
Fee and commission income is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation.
Fee income can be divided into the following categories: FEE INCOME EARNED FROM SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME Fees earned for the provision of services over a period of time are accrued over that period.
These fees include commission incomes and asset management, custody, package services on bundled products and other management and advisory fees.
Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down and other credit related fees are deferred together with any incremental costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan.
CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMME Customer loyalty programme points accumulated in the business are treated as deferred revenue and recognised in revenues gradually as they are earned.
The Group recognises gross revenue earned from customer loyalty programme when the performance obligation is satisfied, i. e. when the customer redeems the points or the points expire, where the Group acts as a principal.
Conversely, the Group measures its revenue as the net amount retained on its account representing the difference between the consideration allocated to the award credits and the amount payable to the third party for supplying the awards as soon as the award credits are granted, where the Group acts as an agent.
At each reporting date the Group estimates a portion of accumulated points that is expected to be utilised by customers based on statistical data.
These points are treated as liability in the statement of financial position and are only recognised in revenue when points are earned or expired.

SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INCOME AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION CONTINUED FEE INCOME FROM PROVIDING TRANSACTION SERVICES Fees arising from negotiating or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party such as the arrangement of the acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses are recognised upon satisfaction of performance obligation on completion of the underlying transaction.
Fees or components of fees that are linked to a certain performance are recognised after fulfilling the corresponding criteria.
DIVIDEND INCOME Dividend revenue is recognised when the Groups right to receive the payment is established.
INSURANCE PREMIUM INCOME For the property & casualty and health insurance business, premiums written are recognised at policy inception and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policy coverage.
Estimates of premiums written as at the reporting date but not yet received are assessed based on estimates from underwriting or past experience and are included in premiums earned.
INSURANCE CLAIMS General insurance claims incurred include all claim losses occurring during the year, whether reported or not, including the related handling costs and reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.
HEALTHCARE REVENUE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The Group recognises healthcare revenue when the Group satisfies a performance obligation at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods and services to a customer.
Healthcare revenue is recognised net of corrections and rebates that occasionally arise as a result of reconciliation of detailed bills with counterparties mostly with the state, to recognise revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the corrections and rebates is subsequently resolved.
Healthcare revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for providing inpatient and outpatient services and includes the following components: Healthcare revenue from insurance companies The Group recognises revenue from the individuals who are insured by various insurance companies based on the completion of the actual medical service and agreed-upon terms between the counterparties.
Healthcare revenue from state The Group recognises the revenue from the individuals who are insured under the state programmes based on the completion of the actual medical service and the agreed-upon terms between the counterparties.
Healthcare revenue from out-of-pocket and other The Group recognises the revenue from non-insured individuals based on the completion of the actual medical service and approved prices by the Group.
Sales are usually in cash or by credit card.
Other revenue from medical services includes revenue from municipalities and other hospitals, with which the Group has contractual relationships.
Sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered calculated according to contractual tariffs.
Revenue from pharma comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable both from wholesale and retail sales and drug exchange transactions.
The pharma business sometimes receives drugs in exchange for sale of drugs from other wholesalers.
The consideration received is assessed with reference to its actual wholesale price which is deemed fair value of consideration received.
UTILITY AND ENERGY REVENUE The Group recognises revenue from utility when the Group satisfies a performance obligation at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods and services to a customer.
The following specific recognition criteria must be met before revenue is recognised: Revenue from water supply includes amounts billed to customers based on the metered or estimated usage of water by legal entities and by application of the relevant tariff for services set per unit of water supplied.
Meters are read on a cyclical basis and the Group recognises revenue for unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the last billing through to the end of the financial year.
Revenue from water supply to population includes amounts billed on a monthly basis to residential customers with meter based on the metered usage of water and by application of the relevant tariff for services set per unit of water supplied or based on the number of individuals person registered by respective city municipality per each residential address without meter by application of the relevant tariff set per capita per month for the general population.
Revenue from connection and water meter installation includes non-refundable amounts billed upfront for connecting customers to the water system and providing them with access to the water supply.
Revenue from connection and water meter installation is recognised over the time in line with the satisfaction of performance obligation over the life of water meters.
Revenue from electric power sales is recognised on the basis of metered electric power transferred.
GROSS REAL ESTATE PROFIT Gross real estate profit comprises revenue from sale of developed real estate property and revaluation gains on such developed properties.
Revenue from sale of developed real estate property is recognised over the time based on the progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation using input method proportion of costs incurred up to date to total expected project cost.
Percentage of completion calculated based on total costs of the building is applied to apartment selling price to recognise revenue from apartment sales.
Payment arrangements of the sale of developed real estate property usually include advance payment of part of the transaction price and progress payments by the customer during the construction, such payments are recognised as deferred income.
Significant financing component is usually immaterial.
GROSS OTHER INVESTMENT PROFIT Gross other investment profit comprises revenue from sale of other finished goods and revaluation of other investment properties that were not developed by the Group.

SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INCOME AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION CONTINUED Revenue from the sale of other finished goods is recognised the Group satisfies the performance obligation, i. e. when the control of the goods has passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.
For finished goods sold on a consignment basis, revenue is recognised when the goods are transferred to the end-customer or on expiration of a specified period.
Revenue recognised in connection with the sale of finished goods reflects an adjustment for the consideration payable to the customer cash amounts that the Group pays, or expects to pay, to a customer.
EBITDA The Group separately presents EBITDA on the face of income statement for the Investment Business.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, as well as cost of credit risk and net non-recurring items for the Investment Business.
NON-RECURRING ITEMS The Group separately classifies and discloses those income and expenses that are non-recurring by nature.
The Group defines non-recurring income or expense as an income or expense triggered by or originated from an economic, business or financial event that is not inherent to the regular and ordinary business course of the Group and is caused by uncertain or unpredictable external factors that cannot be reasonably expected to occur in the future and, thus, they should not be taken into account when making projections of future results.
FUNCTIONAL, REPORTING CURRENCIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in Georgian Lari, which is the Groups presentation currency.
BGEOs and the Banks functional currency is Georgian Lari.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, converted at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into functional currency at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
Gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency transactions are recognised in the consolidated income statement as gains less losses from foreign currencies translation differences.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a certain transaction and the NBG exchange rate on the date of the transaction are included in gains less losses from foreign currencies dealing.
The official NBG exchange rates at 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 were: GEL to GBP GEL to USD GEL to EUR Lari to BYN 31 December 2017 3.5005 2.5922 3.1044 1.3083 31 December 2016 3.2579 2.6468 2.7940 1.3532 31 December 2015 3.5492 2.3949 2.6169 1.2904 As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group are translated into Georgian Lari at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date and, their income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken to other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a subsidiary or an associate whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that particular entity is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and translated at the rate at the reporting date.
ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS AND VOLUNTARY CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below.
IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective for the periods beginning on 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted.
IFRS 15 defines principles for recognising revenue and is applicable to all contracts with customers.
However, interest and fee income integral to financial instruments and leases continue to fall outside the scope of IFRS 15 and are regulated by the other applicable standards.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The standard also specifies a comprehensive set of disclosure requirements regarding the nature, extent and timing as well as any uncertainty of revenue and corresponding cash flows with customers.
IFRS 15 can be adopted using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.
The Group early adopted the new revenue recognition standard effective from 1 January 2017 using the modified retrospective approach.
The impact of early adoption was GEL 29,050 decrease to retained earnings, with a corresponding increase of other liabilities, inventories, income tax liabilities and accounts receivables and other loans.

Accounts receivable are recognised when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.
Deferred revenue is recognised as revenue as we perform under the contract.
The Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Group expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Group transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
The Group recognised GEL 56,804 revenue in the current reporting period that relatesto carried-forward contract liabilities and is included in the deferred income.

AMENDMENTS TO IAS 7 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS: DISCLOSURE INITIATIVE The amendments require entities to provide disclosure of changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes such as foreign exchange gains or losses.
The Group has provided the information for the current period in Note 18.
AMENDMENTS TO IAS 12 INCOME TAXES: RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR UNREALISED LOSSES The amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits against which it may make deductions on the reversal of deductible temporary difference related to unrealised losses.
Furthermore, the amendments provide guidance on how an entity should determine future taxable profits and explain the circumstances in which taxable profit may include the recovery of some assets for more than their carrying amount.
The Group evaluated the impact and concluded that the amendment has no effect on the Groups financial position and performance.
AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 12 DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES: CLARIFICATION OF THE SCOPE OF DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS The amendments clarify that certain disclosure requirements in IFRS 12 apply to an entitys interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate or a portion of its interest in a joint venture or an associate that is classified as held for sale or included in a disposal group.
These amendments did not affect Groups consolidated financial statements.
IAS 16 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT In 2017, the Group changed its accounting policy with respect to office buildings and service centres.
The Group now applies the cost model, where assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment.
Prior to this change in policy, the Group applied the revaluation model, where office buildings and service centres were carried at the fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The Group believes that cost model provides more reliable and more meaningful presentation for investors because 1 it enhances comparability for the investors as the application of the cost model is a market practice across the banking industry and 2 it more closely aligns the accounting with the business model around these asset categories.
The cost model has been applied by restating each of the affected consolidated financial statement line items for the prior periods, as follows: Impact on equity increase decrease in equity : 31-Dec-16 31-Dec-15 01-Jan-15 ASSETS Property and equipment 35,278 36,648 46,653 LIABILITIES: Income tax liabilities 73 5,102 6,456 EQUITY: Retained earnings 6,449 5,785 857 Other reserves 27,870 24,543 37,217 Non-controlling interests 886 1,218 2,123 NET IMPACT ON EQUITY 35,205 31,546 40,197 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 157 Additional Financial Financial Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Strategic Report Information Statements Statements Performance Strategy Overview NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.

CHANGE IN SEGMENT REPORTING At 31 December 2017 and in light of the proposed demerger refer to Note 1 for detail, the Group changed the composition and presentation of its reportable segments.
In line with IFRS 8 requirements, the change was applied retrospectively for comparable periods.
The change primarily related to the presentation of JSC Insurance Company Aldagi, the Groups property and casualty insurance business, which was reclassified from the banking business to the investment business segment.
The Group believes that the revised composition and presentation of its reportable segments provides more relevant information to the financial statement users as it better aligns financial reporting with managements views of operations within the Group and decision-making about resource allocations.
RECLASSIFICATIONS As at 31 December 2017 the Group changed the composition of its reportable segments and corresponding reclassifications have also been made to the consolidated income statement without any impact on total balances on the consolidated statement of financial position.
The following reclassifications were made to year ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 consolidated income statement to conform to the year ended 31 December 2017 presentation requirements.
Management believes that current period presentation provides a better view of the consolidated income statement of the Group: As previously Consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 reported Reclassification As reclassified Banking interest income 927,316 1,287 926,029 Interest income from investment business 2,458 1,287 3,745 Fee and commission income 170,063 482 169,581 Fee and commission expense 47,150 46 47,104 Real estate revenue 99,549 34 99,583 Banking depreciation and amortisation 37,981 774 37,207 Depreciation and amortisation of investment business 9,288 774 10,062 Net banking foreign currency gain 82,909 6,571 89,480 Net other banking income 11,773 1,106 10,667 Net foreign currency gain loss from investment business 3,437 6,571 3,134 Gross other investment profit 19,780 1,508 21,288 As previously Consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2015 reported Reclassification As reclassified Banking interest income 859,778 1,038 858,740 Interest income from investment business 461 1,038 1,499 Banking interest expense 358,388 71 358,317 Interest expense from investment business 226 71 297 Fee and commission income 158,158 394 157,764 Fee and commission expense 39,752 84 39,668 Real estate revenue 53,853 29 53,882 Banking depreciation and amortisation 34,199 834 33,365 Depreciation and amortisation of investment business 1,559 834 2,393 Net banking foreign currency gain 76,926 993 75,933 Net other banking income 18,528 993 17,535 Net foreign currency gain loss from investment business 7,164 993 8,157 Gross other investment profit 17,107 1,274 18,381 158 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 3.
SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE Up to the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements, certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published that are not yet effective for the current reporting period and which the Group has not early adopted.
Such standards that are expected to have an impact on the Group, or the impacts of which are currently being assessed, are as follows: IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTRODUCTION In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9 for annual periods on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted.
In 2016, the Group set up a multidisciplinary implementation team with members from Risk, Finance and Operations teams and hired an external consultant to initiate the implementation of IFRS 9.
The project was sponsored by the Chief Risk and Chief Financial Officers who provided regular updates to the Groups Management Board.
Implementation consisted of six key phases: the initial assessment and analysis, design, build, testing, parallel running and go live.
Currently the Group has completed the IFRS 9 implementation programme including building of the new expected credit loss model and approving the IFRS 9 accounting policy across the Group.
The Group will adopt the new standard from the effective date by recognising the estimated impact from adoption in opening retained earnings on 1 January 2018 and as allowed by IFRS 9 will not restate comparative information.
Based on the data as at 31 December 2017, the Group estimates that the adoption of IFRS 9 will result in a pre-tax decrease in shareholders equity as at 1 January 2018 of approximately GEL 45,144.
IFRS 9 is not expected to have an impact on regulatory capital and capital adequacy ratios regulatory capital requirements in Georgia are set by the National Bank of Georgia and are applied to the Bank on a standalone basis.
A CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT From a classification and measurement perspective, the new standard will require all financial assets, except equity instruments and derivatives, to be assessed based on a combination of the entitys business model for managing the assets and the instruments contractual cash flow characteristics.
The IAS 39 measurement categories will be replaced by: Fair value through profit or loss FVPL, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI with recycling to profit or loss upon disposal for debt instruments, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI without recycling to profit or loss for equity instruments and amortised cost.
IFRS 9 will allow entities to continue to irrevocably designate instruments that qualify for amortised cost or fair value through OCI instruments as FVPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency.
Equity instruments that are not held for trading may be irrevocably designated as FVOCI, with no subsequent reclassification of gains or losses to the income statement.
The accounting treatment for financial liabilities will largely be the same as the requirements of IAS 39, except for the treatment of gains or losses arising from an entitys credit risk relating to liabilities designated at FVPL.
Such movements will be presented in OCI with no subsequent reclassification to the income statement unless an accounting mismatch in profit or loss would arise.
The Group expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value.
Investments in debt securities and equity shares currently held as available-for-sale with gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income will continue to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
The vast majority of loans are expected to satisfy the SPPI criterion and will continue to be measured at amortisedcost.
B IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for expected credit losses ECL on all of its debt financial assets at amortised cost or FVOCI, as well as loan commitments and financial guarantees.
The allowance is based on the ECL associated with the probability of default in the next 12 months unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case the allowance is based on the ECL over the life of the asset.
If the financial asset meets the definition of purchased or originated credit impaired, the allowance is based on the change in the lifetime ECL.
The Group has determined that the allowance for impairment will increase by GEL 31,197.
The Group will apply the simplified approach for trade and other receivables and record lifetime expected losses on all trade and other receivables.
The Group has determined that, due to the unsecured nature of its trade and other receivables, the loss allowance will increase by GEL 13,627 of which GEL 6,962 relates to assets of disposal group held for sale.
In summary, the pre-tax impact of IFRS 9 adoption is expected to be as follows: Pre-tax impact on equity increase decrease as of 31 December 2017: Adjustment Amount ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents B 80 Amounts due from credit institutions B 598 Loans to customers and finance lease receivables B 30,519 Accounts receivable and other loans B 6,665 Assets of disposal group held for sale B 6,962 TOTAL ASSETS 44,824 LIABILITIES Other liabilities provisions B 320 NET IMPACT ON EQUITY, INCLUDING: Retained earnings B 48,270 Other components of equity B 3,255 Non-controlling interests B 129 TOTAL EQUITY 45,144 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 159 Additional Financial Financial Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Strategic Report Information Statements Statements Performance Strategy Overview NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE CONTINUED IFRS 2 CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 2 The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction: the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations: and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled.
On adoption, entities are required to apply the amendments without restating prior periods, but retrospective application is permitted if elected for all three amendments and other criteria are met.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted.
The Group is currently evaluating the impact.
IFRS 16 LEASES IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17.
The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees leases of low-value assets and short-term leases i. e. leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.
At the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments i. e. the lease liability and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term i. e. the right-of-use asset.
Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.
Lessees will also be required to re-measure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events e. g. a change in the lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments.
The lessee will generally recognise the amount of the re-measurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from todays accounting under IAS 17.
Lessors will continue to classify all leases using the same classification principle as in IAS 17 and distinguish between two types of leases: operating and finance leases.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Early application is permitted, but not before an entity applies IFRS 15.
A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.
The standards transition provisions permit certain reliefs.
In 2018, the Group will continue to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements.
TRANSFERS OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY AMENDMENTS TO IAS 40 The amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under construction or development into, or out of, investment property.
The amendments state that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use.
A mere change in managements intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use.
Entities should apply the amendments prospectively to changes in use that occur on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendments.
An entity should reassess the classification of property held at that date and, if applicable, reclassify property to reflect the conditions that exist at that date.
Retrospective application in accordance with IAS 8 is only permitted if it is possible without the use of hindsight.
Amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group is currently assessing the impact.
IFRS 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure.
Once effective, it will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005.
In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts covering all relevant accounting aspects.
IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2021, with comparative figures required.
Early application is permitted using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach, provided the entity also applies IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on or before the date it first applies IFRS 17.

SUMMARY OF SELECTED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED ANNUAL IMPROVEMENTS 2014-2016 CYCLE IAS 28 INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES CLARIFICATION THAT MEASURING INVESTEES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS IS AN  CHOICE The amendments clarify that: An entity that is a venture capital organisation, or other qualifying entity, may elect, at initial recognition on an  basis, to measure its investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss.
If an entity, that is not itself an investment entity, has an interest in an associate or joint venture that is an investment entity, the entity may, when applying the equity method, elect to retain the fair value measurement applied by that investment entity associate or joint venture to the investment entity associates or joint ventures interests in subsidiaries.
This election is made separately for each investment entity associate or joint venture, at the later of the date on which: a the investment entity associate or joint venture is initially recognised: b the associate or joint venture becomes an investment entity: and c the investment entity associate or joint venture first becomes a parent.
The amendments should be applied retrospectively and are effective from 1 January 2018.
The Group does not expect a material effect from application of these amendments.
IFRIC INTERPRETATION 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION The Interpretation clarifies that, in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income or part of it on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which an entity initially recognises the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration.
The Interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Since the Groups current practice is in line with the Interpretation, the Group does not expect any effect on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC INTERPRETATION 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENT The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of IAS 12 and does not apply to taxes or levies outside the scope of IAS 12, nor does it specifically include requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax treatments.
An entity must determine whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments.
The approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty should be followed.
The Interpretation also addresses the assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities, as well as how it considers changes in facts and circumstances.
The interpretation is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, but certain transition reliefs are available.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the Board of Directors and management use their judgement and make estimates in determining the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
The most significant judgements and estimates are as follows: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models.
The input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values Note32.
MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The fair value of investment properties and infrastructure assets included in property and equipment is determined by independent professionally qualified appraisers.
Fair value is determined using a combination of the internal capitalisation method also known as discounted future cash flow method and the sales comparison method.
The Group performs valuation of its investment properties and infrastructure assets included in property and equipment with a sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period.
Results of this valuation are presented in Notes 12 and 13, while valuation inputs and techniques are presented in Note 32.
The Groups properties are specialised in nature and spread across different parts of the country.
While the secondary market in Georgia provides adequate market information for fair value measurements for small and medium-sized properties, valuation of large and unique properties involves application of various observable and unobservable inputs to determine adjustments to the available comparable sale prices.
These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information, however, actual results could be different.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES CONTINUED ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS AND FINANCE LEASE RECEIVABLES The Group regularly reviews its loans and finance lease receivables to assess impairment.
The Group uses its judgement to estimate the amount of any impairment loss in cases where a borrower is in financial difficulties and there are few available sources of historical data relating to similar borrowers.
Similarly, the Group estimates changes in future cash flows based on the observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group.
Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the group of loans and finance lease receivables.
The Group uses its judgement to adjust observable data for a group of loans and finance lease receivables to reflect current circumstances.
The Group considers the fair value of collateral when estimating the amount of impairment loss for collateralised loans and finance lease receivables.
Management monitors market value of collateral on a regular basis.
Management uses its expert judgement or independent opinion to adjust the fair value to reflect current conditions.
The amount and type of collateral required depends on the assessment of credit risk of the counterparty.
Information about allowance for impairment of loans and finance lease receivables is presented in Note 11.
5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ACQUISITIONS IN YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 JSC ABC PHARMACY On 6 January 2017 JSC GEPHA GEPHA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GHG, classified as a disposal group held for sale, acquired 67% of LTD ABC Pharmacy ABC, a pharmaceutical company operating in Georgia, from individual investors.
The fair values of aggregate identifiable assets and liabilities of ABC as at the date of acquisition was: Fair value recognised on acquisition Cash and cash equivalents 4,184 1 Accounts receivable 8,050 Prepayments 1,413 Inventories 44,572 Property and equipment 10,986 Intangible assets 322 Other assets 1,316 70,843 Accounts payable 27,525 Accruals and deferred income 1,861 Other liabilities 1,122 30,508 TOTAL IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS 40,335 3 Non-controlling interests 13,312 Goodwill arising on business combination 46,796 2 CONSIDERATION GIVEN 73,819 1.
The fair value of the receivables from sales of pharmaceuticals amounted to GEL 8,050.
The gross amount of receivables is GEL 9,452.
GEL 1,402 of the receivables has beenimpaired.
Consideration for the acquisition was GEL 73,819, of which, a GEL 10,347 was fair value of 33% equity shares of JSC GPC transferred to former shareholders of ABC, b GEL 32,501 was cash payment and c GEL 30,971 holdback amount at fair value.
As part of the acquisition, the selling shareholders have a put option to sell their 33% share in the combined pharma business to GHG.
The Group recognised a GEL 55 million liability to purchase the remaining 33% share and the non-controlling interest arising from the consolidated pharma business of GHG was fully fide-recognised.
The difference between the redemption liability and non-controlling interest was recognised in equity through other reserves.
The redemption liability is carried at amortised cost and interest is unwound on each reporting date.
The net cash outflow on acquisition was as follows: 31 December 2017 Cash paid 32,501 Cash acquired with the subsidiary 4,184 NET CASH OUTFLOW 28,317 The Group decided to increase its presence and investment in the pharmaceuticals segment through the acquisition of ABC.
Management considers that the deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group.
Since the acquisition, ABC has recorded GEL 139,812 and GEL 15,354 of revenue and profit, respectively.
As the acquisition took place on 6 January 2017, it would not have material effect on the Groups profit if the combination had taken place at the beginning of the period.
Since GHG is classified as a disposal group held for sale the acquisition did not have an impact on the Groups revenues from continued operations.
The primary factor that contributed to the cost of the business combination that resulted in the recognition of goodwill on acquisition is the positive synergy that is expected to be brought into the Groups operations.

COLLATERAL AND OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS The amount and type of collateral required depend on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.
Guidelines are implemented regarding the acceptability of types of collateral and valuation parameters.
The main types of collateral obtained are as follows: For commercial lending, charges over real estate properties, equipment and machinery, corporate shares, inventory, trade receivables and third party corporate guarantees.
For retail lending, mortgages over residential properties, cars, gold and jewellery and third party corporate guarantees.
Management requests additional collateral in accordance with the underlying agreement and monitors the market value of collateral obtained during its review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan impairment.
It is the Groups policy to dispose of repossessed properties in an orderly fashion or to hold them for capital appreciation or earning rentals, as appropriate in each case.
The proceeds are used to reduce or repay the outstanding claim.
In general, the Group does not occupy repossessed properties for business use.
Without taking into account the discounted value of collateral, the allowance for loan impairment would be GEL 253,818 higher as at 31 December 2017 2016: GEL 322,880 higher: 2015: GEL 176,759 higher.

The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units CGU is as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Retail banking 23,386 23,488 23,488 P&C Insurance 15,454 16,139 16,139 Corporate banking 9,965 9,965 9,965 Teliani 6,471 3,439 3,439 Pharmacy 29,025 Healthcare 21,468 16,491 Health Insurance 3,462 3,462 TOTAL 55,276 106,986 72,984 KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN VALUE-IN-USE CALCULATIONS The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a one to three-year period.
Discount rates were not adjusted for either a constant or a declining growth rate beyond the three-year periods covered in financial budgets.
For the purposes of the impairment test, a 3% permanent growth rate has been assumed when assessing the future operating cash flows of the CGU.
The following discount rates were used by the Group for Corporate banking and Retail banking: Corporate banking Retail banking 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Discount rate 4.5% 5.3% 5.8% 6.1% 6.9% 6.7% The following rates were used by the Group for P&C Insurance and Teliani: P&C Insurance Teliani 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Discount rate 9.0% 14.5% 10.4% 12.8% 14.9% 9.4% DISCOUNT RATES Discount rates reflect managements estimate of return required in each business.
This is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future investment proposals.
Discount rates are calculated by using pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC.
For the Healthcare CGU, the following additional assumptions were made over the first three-year period of the business plan: Further synergies from healthcare businesses will increase cost efficiency and further improve operating leverage.
Growth of other healthcare business lines through an increased market demand and economic growth.
For the Retail and Corporate banking CGUs the following additional assumptions were made: Stable, business as usual growth of loans and deposits.
No material changes in cost income structure or ratio.
Stable, business as usual growth of trade finance and other documentary businesses.
Further expansion of the Express banking businesses bringing more stable margins to Retail banking.
SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS Management believes that reasonable possible changes to key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each CGU will not result in an impairment of goodwill.
The excess of value in use over carrying value is determined by reference to the net book value as at 31 December 2017.
Possible change was taken as -1% in discount rate and growth rate.

TAXATION The corporate income tax credit expense comprises: 2017 2016 2015 Current income expense 42,396 25,034 38,959 Deferred income tax credit expense 9,669 63,690 9,449 INCOME TAX EXPENSE CREDIT 32,727 38,656 48,408 Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations 32,340 17,500 48,417 Income tax expense attributable to a discontinued operation Note 6 387 21,156 9 Deferred income tax credit expense in other comprehensive income loss 1,328 2,274 283 Deferred tax related to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income during the years ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Currency translation differences 576 2,253 283 Net losses on investment securities available-for-sale 27 21 Revaluation of buildings 779 INCOME TAX EXPENSE CREDIT IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 1,328 2,274 283 The income tax rate applicable to most of the Groups income is the income tax rate applicable to subsidiaries income which ranges from 15% to 27% 2016: from 15% to 27%: 2015: from 15% to 25%.
In May 2016, the Parliament of Georgia approved a change in the current corporate taxation model, with changes applicable from 1 January 2017 for all entities apart from certain financial institutions, including banks and insurance businesses changes are applicable to financial institutions, including banks and insurance businesses from 1 January 2019.
The changed model implies a zero corporate tax rate on retained earnings and a 15% corporate tax rate on distributed earnings, compared to the previous model of 15% tax rate charged to the companys profit before tax, regardless of the retention or distribution status.
The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rates.
As at 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 a reconciliation of the income tax expense based on statutory rates with the actual expense is as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Profit before income tax expense from continuing operations 435,846 352,787 332,591 Net gain before income tax benefit from discontinued operations Note 6 60,330 37,133 26,762 PROFIT BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE 496,176 389,920 359,353 Average tax rate 15% 15% 15% THEORETICAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE AT AVERAGE TAX RATE 74,426 58,488 53,903 Non-taxable income 38,223 19,711 3,744 Correction of prior year declarations 5,940 2,494 1,472 Non-deductible expenses 1,220 1,645 487 Tax at the domestic rates applicable to profits in each country 1,244 143 262 Effects from changes in tax legislation 76,964 Other 237 1,028 INCOME TAX EXPENSE BENEFIT 32,727 38,656 48,408 Applicable taxes in Georgia and Belarus include corporate income tax profit tax, individuals withholding taxes, property tax and value added tax, among others.
However, regulations are often unclear or non-existent and few precedents have been established.

194 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 31.
RISK MANAGEMENT INTRODUCTION Risk is inherent to the Groups activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls.
This process of risk management is critical to the Groups continuing profitability and each individual within the Group is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, the latter being subdivided into trading and non-trading risks.
It is also subject to operational risks.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry.
They are monitored through the Groups strategic planning process.
RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE AUDIT COMMITTEE The Audit Committee assists the Board in relation to the oversight of the Groups financial and reporting processes.
It monitors the integrity of the financial statements and is responsible for governance around both the internal audit function and external auditor, reporting back to the Board.
It reviews the effectiveness of the policies, procedures and systems in place related to, among other operational risks, compliance, IT and IS including cyber-security and works closely with the Risk Committee in connection with assessing the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control framework.
RISK COMMITTEE The Risk Committee assists the Board in relation to the oversight of risk.
It reviews the Groups risk appetite in line with strategy, identifies and monitors risk exposure and the risk management infrastructure, oversees the implementation of strategy to address risk, and in conjunction with the Audit Committee, assesses the strength and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control framework.
MANAGEMENT BOARD The Management Board has overall responsibility for the Banks asset, liability and risk management activities, policies and procedures.
In order to effectively implement the risk management system, the Management Board delegates individual risk management functions to each of the various decision-making and execution bodies within the Bank.
BANK ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE The Banks Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO is the core risk management body that establishes policies and guidelines with respect to capital adequacy, market risks and respective limits, funding liquidity risk and respective limits, interest rate and prepayment risks and respective limits, money market general terms and credit exposure limits, that designs and implements respective risk management and stress testing models in practice and that regularly monitors compliance with the preset risk limits.
INTERNAL AUDIT The Internal Audit Department is responsible for the annual audit of the Groups risk management, internal control and corporate governance processes, with the aim of reducing the levels of operational and other risks, auditing the Groups internal control systems and detecting any infringements or errors on the part of the Groups departments and divisions.
It examines both the adequacy of and the Groups compliance with those procedures.
The Groups Internal Audit Department discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Audit Committee.
RISK MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING SYSTEMS The Groups risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting models.
The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment.
The Group runs three different basic scenarios, of which one is Base Case forecast under normal business conditions and the other two are Troubled and Distressed Scenarios, which are worse and the worst case scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group.
These limits reflect the business strategy and market environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected industries.
In addition, the Group monitors and measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risks types and activities.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify risks early.
This information is presented and explained to the Management Board, and the Head of each business division.
The reports include aggregate credit exposures and their limits, exceptions to those limits, liquidity ratios and liquidity limits, market risk ratios and their limits, and changes to the risk profile.
Senior management assesses the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a monthly basis.
The Management Board receives a comprehensive Credit Risk report and ALCO report once a month.
These reports are designed to provide all the necessary information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group.
For all levels throughout the Group, specifically tailored risk reports are prepared and distributed in order to ensure that all business divisions have access to extensive, relevant and up-to-date information.
A daily briefing is given to the Management Board and all other relevant employees of the Group on the utilisation of market limits, proprietary investments and liquidity, plus any other risk developments.
RISK MITIGATION As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity risks, credit risks, and exposures arising from forecast transactions.
While these are intended for hedging, they do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The Group actively uses collateral to reduce its credit risks see overhead for more detail.
Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 195 Additional Financial Financial Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Strategic Report Information Statements Statements Performance Strategy Overview NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31.
RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED INTRODUCTION CONTINUED EXCESSIVE RISK CONCENTRATION Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or these counterparties represent related parties to each other, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
Concentrations also involve combined, aggregate exposures of large and significant credits compared to the total outstanding balance of the respective financial instrument.
Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Groups performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographical location.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the Groups policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio of both financial assets as well as financial liabilities.
Identified concentrations of credit risks or liquidity repayment risks are controlled and managed accordingly.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties fail to discharge their contractual obligations.
The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties and for geographical, industry, product and currency concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits.
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties, including regular collateral revisions.
Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit risk classification system, which assigns each counterparty a risk rating.
Risk ratings are subject to regular revision.
The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective action.
The maximum credit exposure is limited to carrying value of respective instruments and notional amounts of guarantees and commitments provided.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as recorded in the statement of the financial position.
CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS RISKS The Group makes available to its customers guarantees which may require that the Group make payments on their behalf.
Such payments are collected from customers based on the terms of the letter of credit.
They expose the Group to similar risks to loans and these are mitigated by the same control processes and policies.
CREDIT QUALITY PER CLASS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The credit quality of financial assets is managed by the Group through internal credit ratings.
The table below shows the credit quality by class of asset for loan-related lines in the statement of financial position, based on the Groups credit rating system.
RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED CREDIT RISK CONTINUED Past due loans to customers, analysed by age below, include those that are past due by at least one day and are not impaired.
This facilitates focused management of the applicable risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic regions and products.
The rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk.
All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Groups rating policy.
Attributable risk ratings are assessed and updated regularly.
The credit risk assessment policy for non-past due and individually non-impaired financial assets has been determined by the Group as follows: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due no more than 30 days is assessed as a financial asset with High grade: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 30 but less than 60 days is assessed as a financial asset with Standard grade: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 60 days or the borrower of this loan has at least an additional borrowing in past due more than 60 days as at reporting date is assessed as a financial asset with Sub-Standard grade.
RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED CREDIT RISK CONTINUED See Note 11 for more detailed information with respect to the allowance for impairment of loans to customers and finance lease receivables.
The Group specifically monitors performance of the loans with overdue payments in arrears for more than 90 days.
The gross carrying value i. e. carrying value before deducting any allowance for impairment of such loans comprised GEL 278,284, GEL 293,054 and GEL 166,224 as at 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, respectively.
CARRYING AMOUNT PER CLASS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS WHOSE TERMS HAVE BEEN RENEGOTIATED The table below shows the carrying amount for renegotiated financial assets, by class as at 31 December: 2017 2016 2015 Loans to customers: Commercial loans 103,365 235,026 141,294 Micro and SME loans 47,539 37,003 20,890 Residential mortgage loans 44,058 38,757 28,594 Consumer loans 39,318 29,828 18,243 Finance lease receivables 5,508 5,829 2,684 TOTAL 239,788 346,443 211,705 IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT The main considerations for the loan impairment assessment include whether any payments of principal or interest are overdue by any number of days or there are any known difficulties in the cash flows of counterparties, credit rating downgrades, or infringement of the original terms of the contract.
The Group addresses impairment assessment in two areas: individually assessed allowances and collectively assessed allowances.
Loans are considered to be individually impaired if they are past due by certain number of days as prescribed per the Group methodology, or history of the debt service is deteriorated by a certain percentage, as defined per the Group methodology, or any other defined event of a default is identified.
Impairment for all such loans is assessed individually, rather than through a collective impairment assessment model of the Group.
INDIVIDUALLY ASSESSED ALLOWANCES For loan loss allowance determination purposes the Group considers all individually significant loans and classifies them between being individually impaired and not impaired.
The allowance for those individually significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired is determined through individual assessment of the associated credit risk.
The allowances for non-significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired are also individually assessed.
The allowance for losses for individually significant loans that are determined not to be individually impaired is assessed through the collective assessment approach described below.
Items considered when determining allowance amounts include the sustainability of the counterpartys business plan, its ability to improve performance once a financial difficulty has arisen, projected receipts and the expected dividend payout should bankruptcy ensue, the availability of other financial support and the realisable value of collateral, the timing of the expected cash flows and past history of the debt service of the borrower.
Impairment losses are evaluated at each reporting date, unless unforeseen circumstances require more careful attention.
COLLECTIVELY ASSESSED ALLOWANCES Allowances are assessed collectively for all loans including but not limited to credit cards, residential mortgages, and unsecured consumer lending, commercial lending, etc.
both significant as well as non-significant, where there is not yet objective evidence of individual impairment.
Allowances are evaluated on each reporting date with each portfolio receiving a separate review.
The collective assessment takes into account the impairment that is likely to be present in the portfolio even though there is not yet objective evidence of the impairment in an individual assessment.
Impairment losses are estimated by taking into consideration the following information: historical losses on the portfolio, current economic conditions, the appropriate delay between the time a loss is likely to have been incurred and the time it will be identified as requiring an individually assessed impairment allowance, and expected receipts and recoveries once impaired.
Local management is responsible for deciding the length of this period which can extend for as long as one year, depending on the product.
The impairment allowance is then reviewed by credit management to ensure alignment with the Groups overall policy.
Financial guarantees and letters of credit are assessed and provision is made in a similar manner to loans.
198 Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 31.
To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its core deposit base, manages assets with liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis.
This incorporates an assessment of expected cash flows and the availability of high grade collateral which could be used to secure additional funding if required.
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption of cash flow.
The Group also has committed lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity needs.
In addition, the Group maintains a cash deposit obligatory reserve with the NBG, the amount of which depends on the level of customer funds attracted.
The liquidity position is assessed and managed by the Group primarily on a standalone Bank basis, based on certain liquidity ratios established by the NBG.
Minimum NBG requirement for liquidity ratio is 30%, calculated as average liquid assets during the month as defined by the NBG divided by liabilities for the same month with certain exceptions established by the NBG.
For the years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 these ratios were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Average liquidity ratio 39.8% 43.6% 38.1% Maximum liquidity ratio 47.0% 62.5% 48.0% Minimum liquidity ratio 31.3% 34.1% 28.9% Annual Report 2017 BGEO Group PLC 199 Additional Financial Financial Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Strategic Report Information Statements Statements Performance Strategy Overview NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31.
RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The average liquidity ratio is calculated on a standalone basis for JSC Bank of Georgia as the annual average arithmetic mean of daily liquidity ratios, computed as the ratio of liquid assets to liabilities determined by the National Bank of Georgia as follows: Liquid assets comprise cash, cash equivalents and other assets that are immediately convertible into cash.
Those assets include investment securities issued by the Georgian Government plus Certificates of Deposit issued by NBG and do not include amounts due from credit institutions, other than inter-bank deposits, and or debt securities of Governments and Central Banks of non-OECD countries, amounts in nostro accounts which are under lien, impaired inter-bank deposits and amounts on obligatory reserve with NBG that are pledged due to borrowings from NBG.
Liabilities comprise the total balance sheet liabilities, less amounts due to credit institutions that are to be exercised or settled later than six months from the reporting date, plus off-balance sheet commitments with residual maturity subsequent to the reporting date of less than six months.
Off-balance sheet commitments include all commitments except financial guarantees and letters of credit that are fully collateralised by customer deposits placed in the Bank, and commitments due to dealing operations with foreign currencies.
The maximum and minimum liquidity ratios are taken from historical data of the appropriate reporting years.
In addition, on 15 May 2017 NBG issued an Order on Liquidity Coverage Ratio for Commercial Banks, which became effective from 1 September 2017.
Pursuant to that order, banks are required to maintain a liquidity coverage ratio, which is defined as the ratio of high quality liquid assets to net cash outflow over the next 30 days.
The order requires that, absent a stress-period, the value of the ratio be no lower than 100%.
The liquidity coverage ratio as at 31 December 2017 was 112.4%.
The Group also matches the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and imposes a maximum limit on negative gaps compared to the Banks standalone total regulatory capital calculated per NBG regulation.
The ratios are assessed and monitored monthly and compared against set limits.
In the case of deviations, amendment strategies actions are discussed and approved by ALCO.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.
Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately.
However, the Group expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Bank could be required to pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by the Banks deposit retention history.
Contractual expiry by maturity of the Groups financial commitments and contingencies Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 Over 3 months months years 5 years Total 31 December 2017 396,907 194,430 326,812 110,425 1,028,574 31 December 2016 401,159 230,831 303,451 41,966 977,407 31 December 2015 411,175 300,894 142,915 17,281 872,265 The Group expects that not all of the contingent liabilities or commitments will be drawn before expiry of the commitments.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The maturity analysis does not reflect the historical stability of current accounts.
Their liquidation has historically taken place over a longer period than indicated in the tables above.
These balances are included in amounts due in less than three months in the tables above.
Included in client deposits and notes are term deposits of individuals.
In accordance with the Georgian legislation, the Bank is obliged to repay such deposits upon demand of a depositor Note 17.
MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchanges, and equity prices.
The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading portfolios.
Trading and non-trading positions are managed and monitored using sensitivity analysis.
INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups consolidated income statement.
The sensitivity of the consolidated income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest income for the year, based on the floating rate for non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2017.
Changes in basis points are calculated as standard deviations of daily changes in floating rates over the last month multiplied by respective floating rates.
During the years ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Groups equity.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED MARKET RISK CONTINUED CURRENCY RISK Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Management Board has set limits on positions by currency based on the NBG regulations.
The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Group had significant exposure at 31 December 2017 on its monetary assets and liabilities.
The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari, with all other variables held constant on the income statement due to the fair value of currency sensitive non-trading monetary assets and liabilities.
The reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari is calculated as a standard deviation of daily changes in exchange rates over the 12 months.
A negative amount in the table reflects a potential net reduction in income statement or equity, while a positive amount reflects a net potential increase.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, year ended 31 December 2016 and year ended 31 December 2015, sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Groups equity.
2017 2016 2015 Change in Effect on Change in Effect on Change in Effect on currency profit before currency profit before currency profit before Currency rate in % tax rate in % tax rate in % tax EUR 12.0% 2,487 11.6% 3,336 2.9% 1 USD 8.9% 5,758 9.3% 3,507 1.1% 1,329 PREPAYMENT RISK Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or request repayment earlier than expected, such as fixed rate mortgages when interest rates fall, or other credit facilities, for similar or whatever reasons.
The Group calculates the effect of early repayments by calculating the weighted average rates of early repayments across each loan product individually, applying these historical rates to the outstanding carrying amount of respective products as at the reporting date and multiplying by the weighted average effective annual interest rates for each product.
The model does not make a distinction between different reasons for repayment e. g. relocation, refinancing and renegotiation and takes into account the effect of any prepayment penalties on the Groups income.
The estimated effect of prepayment risk on net interest income of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 is as follows: Effect on net interest income 2017 46,527 2016 27,487 2015 19,341 OPERATIONAL RISK Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events.
When controls fail to perform, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss.
The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Group is able to manage the risks.
Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, including the use of internal audit.
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT Most of the Groups business is concentrated in Georgia.
As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a well-developed business and regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy.
Operations in Georgia may involve risks that are not typically associated with those in developed markets including the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the country, and undeveloped debt and equity markets.
However, over the last few years the Georgian Government has made a number of developments that positively affect the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to create banking, judicial, taxation and regulatory systems.
This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation including new Tax Code and procedural laws.
In the view of the Board, these steps contribute to mitigating the risks of doing business in Georgia.
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist.
The future stability of the Georgian economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the Government.
However, the Georgian economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in theworld.
INSURANCE RISK The risk under an insurance contract is the risk that an insured event will occur including the uncertainty of the amount and timing of any resulting claim.
The principal risk the Group faces under such contracts is that actual claims and benefit payments exceed the carrying amount of insurance liabilities.
This is influenced by the frequency of claims, severity of claims, actual benefits paid that are greater than originally estimated and subsequent development of long-term claims.
The variability of risks is improved by diversification of risk of loss to a large portfolio of insurance contracts as a more diversified portfolio is less likely to be affected across the board by change in any subset of the portfolio, as well as unexpected outcomes.
The variability of risks is also improved by careful selection and implementation of underwriting strategy and guidelines as well as the use of reinsurance arrangements.
The Group establishes underwriting guidelines and limits, which stipulate who may accept what risks and the applicable limits.
These limits are continuously monitored.

These incorporate the Groups estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and option contracts.
The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations, as well as standard option pricing models.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
TRADING SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES Trading securities and a certain part of investment securities are quoted equity and debt securities.
Investment securities valued using a valuation technique or pricing models consist of unquoted equity and debt securities.
These securities are valued using models which sometimes only incorporate data observable in the market and at other times use both observable and non-observable data.
The non-observable inputs to the models include assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the investee, its risk profile, and economic assumptions regarding the industry and geographical jurisdiction in which the investee operates.

ASSETS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity less than three months, it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value.
This assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
FIXED RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
MATURITY ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The table below shows an analysis of financial assets and liabilities according to their contractual maturities, except for current accounts as described below.
See Note 31 Risk management for the Groups contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.
In the Georgian marketplace, where most of the Groups business is concentrated, many short-term credits are granted with the expectation of renewing the loans at maturity.
As such, the ultimate maturity of assets may be different from the analysis presented above.
To reflect the historical stability of current accounts, the Group calculates the minimal daily balance of current accounts over the past two years and includes the amount in the up to 1 year category in the table above.
The remaining current accounts are included in the On demand category.
The Groups principal sources of liquidity are as follows: deposits: borrowings from international credit institutions: inter-bank deposit agreements: debt issues: proceeds from sale of securities: principal repayments on loans: interest income: and fees and commissions income.
These funds continue to provide a majority of the Groups funding and represent a diversified and stable source of funds.
In the Boards opinion, liquidity is sufficient to meet the Groups present requirements.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY The Group maintains an actively managed capital base to cover risks inherent in the business.
The adequacy of the Groups capital is monitored using, among other measures, the ratios established by the NBG in supervising the Bank.
Approved and published on 28 October 2013 by NBG, a new capital adequacy regulation became effective in 2014, based on Basel II III requirements, adjusted for NBGs discretionary items.
Pillar 1 requirements became effective on 30 June 2014, with Pillar II ICAAP requirements becoming effective 30 June 2015.
A transition period continued through to 31 December 2017, during which the Bank was required to comply with both the new, and the current, capital regulations of the NBG.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Bank and the Group complied in full with all its externally imposed capital requirements.
The primary objectives of the Groups capital management are to ensure that the Bank complies with externally imposed capital requirements and that the Group maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and to maximise value for shareholders.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its activities.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies and processes from the previous years.
NBG CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO The NBG requires banks to maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 9.6% of risk-weighted assets, computed based on the Banks standalone special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with NBG regulations and pronouncements.
