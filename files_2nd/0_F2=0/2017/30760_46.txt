Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 16 Goodwill continued Results of impairment testing As a result of the announced sale of the Groups entire shareholding in FPI, the recoverable amount of FPI within the wider Asian cash generating unit was determined based on the agreed consideration less costs to sell.
This indicated an impairment of goodwill and AVIF related to non-participating investment contracts of 8 million and 110 million see also note 17 respectively as a result of the shortfall of 118 million between FPIs carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell of 334 million.
Our estimate of fair value less costs to sell was calculated on the basis of the agreed sales consideration of 340 million see note 3 c ii after deducting a 6 million reinsurance recapture fee between FPI and Aviva Re Limited which is embedded in the sale agreement.
Managements impairment review in relation to the goodwill allocated to the Canadian cash generating unit, Quebec personal lines, indicated the need to write-down a remaining balance of 2 million of goodwill allocated to Elite Insurance Company, resulting from the continued deterioration of the financial position of the cash generating unit.
Other than for the cash generating units noted above, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating units including goodwill, and there is no impairment of goodwill in 2017.
For these cash generating units, a reasonably possible change in assumptions would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
