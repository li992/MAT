Annual Report 2017 146 Great Portland Estates Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Head leases The present value of future ground rents is added to the carrying value of a leasehold investment property and to long-term liabilities.
On payment of a ground rent, virtually all of the cost is charged to the income statement, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged to the income statement.
Development management agreements Should the Group sell a development property prior to completion, it will often have a development management agreement with the buyer to construct the remainder of the building on their behalf.
Where the outcome of this development management agreement can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured as the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed bear to the estimated total contract costs.
Variations in work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the counterparty.
Where the outcome of the development management agreement cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable.
Costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total costs will exceed total revenue, the expected loss isrecognised as an expense immediately.
