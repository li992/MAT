Accounting policies Accounting policies applicable throughout the financial statements are shown below.
Accounting policies that are specific to a component of the financial statements have been incorporated in the relevant note.
a Basis of preparation Grainger plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
It is a public limited liability company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the Group, and equity account the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company and not the Group.
The Group financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2017 have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards EU IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has prepared its company financial statements in accordance withFinancial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101, which are presented on pages 136 to 144.
The accounting policies set out below and in notes to the financial statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Group financial statements.
No new accounting policies have been adopted in the yearand there has been no change to the basis of accounting estimates in the year.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets and liabilities, and corresponding income statement accounts, which are stated at their fair value: investment property: derivative financial instruments: financial interest in property assets: and assets classified as held-for-sale.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with EU IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the events and amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.
Going concern The Directors are required to make an assessment of the Groups ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have given this matter due consideration and have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis.
The main considerations were as follows: i Covenant compliance The Directors have reviewed the Groups financial projections covering a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial statements, which include covenant compliance forecasts.
These projections show that the Group will meet its covenant requirements.
ii Banking facilities The Directors have reviewed the available headroom on the Group.
Cash flow projections confirm that the Group will remain within its facilities for a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial statements.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 93 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued ii Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Where the Group owns less than 50% of the voting rights but acts as property and or asset manager an assessment is made as to whether or not the Group has fide facto control over an investee.
This includes a review of the Groups rights relative to those of another investor or investors and the ability the Group has to direct the investees relevant activities further detail is provided in Note 19.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss after the date of acquisition.
The joint venture and associate results for the 12 months to 30 September 2017 and the financial position as at that date have beenequity accounted in these financial statements.
The Groups share of its joint ventures and associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Where the Groups interest has been reduced to nil, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
The accounting policies of joint ventures and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
iii Business combinations At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset.
The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities are acquired in addition to the property.
When the acquisition of a subsidiary does not represent a business, it is accounted for as an acquisition of assets and liabilities.
The cost of acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.
iv Goodwill and impairment Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given and equity instruments issued.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets, including intangible assets, of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Costs attributable to an acquisition are expensed in the consolidated income statement under the heading Other expenses.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included within this caption in the statement of financial position.
Goodwill on acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 94 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information c Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the current financial year that have a material impact on the Group.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards have been issued but are not yet effective for the Group.
The most significant of these, and their potential impact on the Groups accounting, are set out below: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective from 1 April 2018 The standard applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment provisioning and hedge accounting.
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS 9.
Adoption of the new standard is expected to have limited impact on the measurement of the Groups financial liabilities.
The adoption will require presentational changes.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective from 1 April 2018 The standard will be applicable to property andasset management fee income and proceeds from the disposal of trading and investment property, but not gross rental income.
Based on the transactions impacting the current financial year and future known transactions, the Group does not expect the adoption of IFRS 15 to have a material impact on the Groups reported results.
However, we will continue to assess new transactions as they arise to the date of adoption.
IFRS 16 Leases effective from 1 April 2019 The adoption of this standard is not expected to significantly impact the recognition of rental income earned under the Groups leases with tenants.
The Group holds operating leases as a lessee in relation to its office premises which are affected by this standard and as such adoption of the new standard may impact the measurement and presentation of the Groups assets and liabilities.
IAS 40 Investment Property, proposed amendment.
In November 2015 the IASB issued an Exposure Draft on a proposed amendment to clarify situations in which properties can be transferred from investment property to trading property and viceversa.
The IASB further announced in July 2016 that it has now recommended finalising this amendment.
The Group willconsider reclassification of individual assets if it is appropriate and circumstances meet the definitions and requirements ofthe amendment.
Of the other IFRSs that are available for early adoption, none are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Groups significant accounting policies are stated in the relevant notes to the Group financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets andliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in anyfuture periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below.
Estimates 1 Valuation of property assets Residential trading property is carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value and investment property is carried at fair value.
The Group does, however, in its principal non-GAAP net asset value measures, EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV, include trading property at market value.
The adjustment in the value of trading property is the difference between the statutory book value and its market value as set out in Note 5.
For investment property, market value is the same as fair value.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 95 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued The results and the basis of each valuation and their impact on both the statutory financial statements and market value for the Groups non-GAAP net asset value measures are set out below: % of properties for which Financial external valuer Residential Development Others assets Total provides m m m m m Valuer valuation Trading property 797.6 43.7 841.3 Investment property 391.0 391.0 Financial asset CHARM 86.1 86.1 Total statutory book value 1,188.6 43.7 86.1 1,318.4 Trading property Residential 1,052.6 1,052.6 Allsop LLP 69% GInvest 373.6 373.6 Allsop LLP 100% Developments 19.5 41.4 60.9 CBRE Limited 85% Total trading property 1,445.7 41.4 1,487.1 Investment property Residential 122.8 122.8 Allsop LLP 69% Tricomm Housing 120.1 120.1 Allsop LLP 100% Affordable housing 27.5 27.5 Allsop LLP 100% PRS build to rent 120.6 120.6 CBRE Limited 93% Total investment property 391.0 391.0 3 Financial asset CHARM 86.1 86.1 Allsop LLP Total assets at market value 1,836.7 41.4 86.1 1,964.2 Statutory book value 1,188.6 43.7 86.1 1,318.4 1 Market value adjustment 648.1 2.3 645.8 Total assets at market value 1,836.7 41.4 86.1 1,964.2 Net revaluation gain recognised in the income statement for wholly-owned properties 16.2 1.8 18.0 Net revaluation gain relating to joint ventures 2 and associates 5.4 5.4 2 Net revaluation gain recognised in the year 16.2 1.8 5.4 23.4 1 The market value adjustment is the difference between the statutory book value and the market value of the Groups properties.

2 Includes Group share of joint ventures and associates revaluation gain after tax.
3 Allsop provides vacant possession values used by the Directors to value the financial asset in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 21. i Residential The Groups own in-house qualified team provided a vacant possession value for the majority of the Groups UK residential properties as at 30 September 2017.
A structured sample of these in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP, an external independent valuer.
Valuing the large number of properties in this portfolio is a significant task.
For this reason it is undertaken on an external inspection basis only.
Invariably, when the in-house valuations are compared with those of the external valuer, around 75% of the valuations are within a small acceptable tolerance.
Where the difference is more significant, this is discussed with the valuer to determine the reasons for the difference.
Typically, the reasons vary, but it could be, for example, that further or better information about internal condition is available or that respective valuers have placed a different interpretation on comparable sales.
Once such reasons have been identified, the Group and the valuer agree the appropriate valuation that should be adopted as the Directors Valuation.
Allsop LLP has provided the Directors with the following opinion on the Directors Valuation.
Property held in the Residential Portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2017 by Graingers in-house surveyors.
These valuations were reviewed and approved by the Directors.
Allsop LLP has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Directors Valuation and they are satisfied with the process by which the in-house valuations were conducted.
Allsop LLP valued approximately 78% of the Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 96 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Residential Portfolio, independently of the Group.
Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP has concluded that they have a high degree of confidence in those Directors Valuations.
Allsop LLP also recommends a discount to apply to the vacant possession valuations to establish the market value of each property.
For property in the Residential Portfolio, the discounts are established by tenancy type and are based on evidence gathered by Allsop LLP from recent transactional market evidence.
ii GInvest All of the property owned by the Group in the GInvest portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2017 by Allsop LLP.
The market value of the properties subject to the assumption that the dwellings would be sold individually, which is deemed to bethe highest and best use, in their existing condition, and subject to any existing leases or tenancies was provided by Allsop LLP.
Thevaluers opinion of market value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms-length terms.
iii Tricomm Housing Allsop LLP provided an investment valuation as at 30 September 2017 for the property assets owned by the Group and let under a long-term lease arrangement with the Secretary of State for Defence under a PFI project agreement.
The investment valuation hasbeen made in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards, and is based on a discounted cash flow model.
iv Affordable housing For properties let on affordable rents, social rents or sold on shared ownership leases, Allsop LLP valued the assets on the basis of Existing Use Value for Social Housing EUV-SH in line with RICS Global Standards.
Properties subject to intermediate rents have been valued at market value as these assets are not restricted as social housing in perpetuity.
Significant unobservable inputs within the valuation relate to assumptions for house price inflation and the discount rates to apply to the cash flows.
The assumptions adopted for house price inflation are 3.25% in 2018, 3.50% in 2019, 3.25% in 2020, 2021 and 2022 and 2.75% thereafter.
The discount rates applied to the cash flows range between 3.3% and 9.0%.
v Financial asset CHARM The valuation methodology adopted for the CHARM asset is set out in Note 21 to the financial statements.
The key assumptions affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate.
The assumptions used to value theasset adopt an increase in house prices of between 2.5% and 4.0% per annum.
A discount rate of 3.5% has been applied to the interest income and a rate of 6.5% has been applied to the projected proceeds from sales of the underlying properties, reflecting the risk profile of each individual income stream.
The fair value of the interest changes as cash flows are realised and a decrease of 1.0m 2016: increase of 2.9m in the fair value has been recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and the available-for-sale reserve.
Credit risk arises from the credit exposure relating to cash receipts from the financial instrument.
All of the cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
vi Developments The current market value of the Groups land and property held within the development segment has been assessed by CBRE Limited which are external independent valuers.
Their valuation, representing 85% of the total value of development trading stock, ison the basis of fair value as defined in the RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.
Theremaining 15% of the portfolio is a Directors Valuation.
vii PRS build-to-rent assets CBRE assessed the current fair value of the completed assets and assets in the course of construction.
The principal approach was to value the apartments on an income capitalisation basis, having regard to prevailing market conditions and evidence, and with close regard to the relativity between the market value and the aggregate vacant possession value.
Where applicable, estimated costs required tocomplete construction have been taken into account.
The valuation has been prepared in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 97 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued viii Joint ventures and associates Property assets in the joint venture Walworth Investment Properties Limited WIP are valued on the same basis as the GInvestportfolio.
Property assets in the associate GRIP REIT PLC were valued at 30 June 2017 by external valuers, CBRE Limited.
In aggregate, the valuation of the individual dwellings as at 30 June 2017 was 660.5m for all assets still held at 30 September 2017.
In assessing the Groups share of GRIP REIT net assets for the purposes of the Groups financial statements to 30 September 2017, after full consideration of movement in house price indices, the Groups Directors made a 0.25% 1.5m adjustment to increase the 30 June 2017 valuations.
The Directors consider the valuations provided by external valuers to be representative of fair value.
As required by RICS Professional Valuation Standards, all of the external valuers in the UK mentioned above have made full disclosureof the extent and duration of their work for, and fees earned by them from, the Group, which in all cases are less than 5%oftheir total fees.
2 Net realisable value of trading property The Groups residential trading properties are carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the net sales proceeds which the Group expects on sale of a property with vacant possession.
The Group has a net realisable value provision of 8.1m as at 30 September 2017 2016: 3.2m.
The provision includes specific properties which are vacant and properties we expect to become vacant in the future.
3 Derivative financial instruments Fair value measurements for derivative financial instruments are obtained from quoted market prices and or valuation models asappropriate.
When not directly observable in active markets, the fair value of derivative contracts must be computed internally based on internal assumptions as well as directly observable market information, including forward and yield curves for commodities, currencies and interest.
Changes in internal assumptions and forward curves could materially impact the internally computed fair value of derivative contracts, particularly long-term contracts, resulting in a corresponding impact on income or loss in the consolidated income statement.
Changes to key assumptions could impact both income and financial position.
The impact of changes to key assumptions is considered for assets using a range of reasonable changes.
The Group measures its market risk exposure internally by running various sensitivity analyses.
The Directors consider that a 2 percentage point 2016: 2 percentage point movement in house prices represents a reasonable possible change.
The table below sets out potential impacts that may result from changes to certain assumptions: 2017 2016 Statement Statement Income of financial Income of financial statement position statement position impact impact impact impact m m m m Increase of 2% in house prices GRIP 3.4 3.4 3.0 3.0 Decrease of 2% in house prices GRIP 3.4 3.4 3.0 3.0 Increase of 2% in house prices NRV provision 1.0 1.0 0.4 0.4 Decrease of 2% in house prices NRV provision 1.1 1.1 1.0 1.0 Increase of 25bps in HPI rate CHARM 0.2 1.3 0.2 1.2 Decrease of 25bps in HPI rate CHARM 0.2 1.3 0.2 1.1 Increase of 1% in discount rate CHARM 5.9 6.6 Decrease of 1% in discount rate CHARM 6.6 7.5 Increase of 25bps in discount rate Tricomm Housing 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 Decrease of 25bps in discount rate Tricomm Housing 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.4 Increase of 25bps in HPI rate Tricomm Housing 1.7 1.7 1.6 1.6 Decrease of 25bps in HPI rate Tricomm Housing 1.7 1.7 1.6 1.6 Increase of 25bps in gross yield PRS build-to-rent 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 Decrease of 25bps in gross yield PRS build-to-rent 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 98 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Judgements 1 Distinction between investment and trading property The Group considers the intention at the outset when each property is acquired in order to classify the property as either an investment or a trading property.
Where the intention is either to trade the property or where the property is held for immediate saleupon receiving vacant possession within the ordinary course of business, the property is classified as trading property.
Where the intention is to hold the property for its long-term rental yield and or capital appreciation, the property is classified as an investment property.
2 Adjusted earnings Adjusted earnings is one of Graingers key performance indicators.
The metric is utilised as a key measure to aid understanding of theperformance of the continuing business and excludes valuation movements and non-recurring items that are one-off in nature, which do not form part of the normal ongoing revenue or costs of the business and, either individually or in aggregate, are material tothe reported Group results.
The classification of amounts as non-recurring is a significant judgement made by management and isa matter referred to the Audit Committee for approval.
Non-recurring items in 2017 saw a charge of 2.8m 2016: 7.4m income.
The charge in the year comprised two main components.
1.2m relates to the implementation of strategic change in operations and 1.6m relates to a provision for historic non-core businesses.
In 2016, 7.4m income was recorded relating to these non-core businesses.
Discontinued operations Accounting policy A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale.
For the discontinued operation, the comparable income statement and other comprehensive income have been re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 3.
Discontinued operations continued During the previous financial year, the Group disposed of the Retirement Solutions division, other than the CHARM portfolio whichwas retained, and the majority of the German operations.
These operations were classified as discontinued.

Segmental information Accounting policy IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified based upon the Groups internal reporting to the ChiefOperating Decision Maker CODM so that the CODM can make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments andassess their performance.
The Groups CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.
The three significant segments for continuing operations are Residential, Development and Funds.
The title Other has been included in the tables below to reconcile the segments to the figures reviewed by the CODM and includes certain central costs that cannot be allocated to the operating segments.
The key operating performance measure of profit or loss used by the CODM is adjusted earnings before tax, valuation and non-recurring items.
The CODM reviews by segment two key statement of financial position measures of net asset value.
These are EPRA Net Asset Value EPRA NAV and EPRA Triple Net Asset Value EPRA NNNAV.

Tax Accounting policy The taxation charge for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The charge is recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Current tax payable or receivable is based on the taxable income for the period and any adjustment in respect of prior periods and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will give rise to a future tax liability against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

The Group works in an open and transparent manner and maintains a regular dialogue with HM Revenue and Customs.
This approach is consistent with the low risk rating we have been awarded by HM Revenue and Customs, and to which the Group is committed.
The Groups results for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 19.5% 2016: 20%.
The tax charge for the year is different to the charge for the year derived by applying the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.5% 2016: 20% to the profit before tax.
The differences are explained below: 2017 2016 m m Profit before tax including discontinued operations 87.8 146.2 Profit before tax at a rate of 19.5% 2016: 20% 17.1 29.2 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.7 1.5 Share of joint ventures associates after tax 0.8 0.5 Non-taxable disposal and revaluation of investments 0.4 13.2 Impact of tax rate changes 3.9 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 4.5 2.2 Amounts recognised in the income statement 13.1 10.9 In addition to the above, a deferred tax charge of 2.6m 2016: deferred tax credit of 2.2m was recognised within other comprehensive income comprising: 2017 2016 m m Deferred tax Actuarial deficit on BPT Limited pension scheme 0.8 0.5 Equity component of available-for-sale financial asset 0.2 0.2 Fair value movement in cash flow hedges and exchange adjustments 2.0 1.9 Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income 2.6 2.2 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 109 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14.

In addition to the tax amounts shown above, contingent tax based on EPRA market value measures being tax on the difference between the carrying value of trading properties in the statement of financial position and their market value has not been recognised by the Group.
This contingent tax amounts to 109.8m 2016: 110.4m.
It is not possible for the Group to identify the timing of movements in deferred tax between those expected within one year andthose expected in a period greater than one year.
This is because movements in the main balances, both assets and liabilities, will be determined by factors outside the control of the Group, namely the vacation date of properties and interest yield curve movements.
However, given the long-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly be crystallised in a period greater than one year.
Dividends Accounting policy Dividends are recognised through equity when approved by the Companys shareholders or on payment, whichever is earlier.
Dividends paid in the year are shown below: 2017 2016 m m Ordinary dividends on equity shares: Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2015 2.11p per share 8.7 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2016 1.45p per share 6.0 Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2016 3.05p per share 12.7 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2017 1.60p per share 6.6 19.3 14.7 Subject to approval at the AGM, the final dividend of 3.26p per share gross amounting to 13.6m will be paid on 9 February 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 29 December 2017.
Shareholders will again be offered the option to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan and the last day for election is 15 January 2018.
An interim dividend of 1.60p per share amounting to a total of 6.6m was paid to shareholders on 30 June 2017.

Earnings per share Accounting policy Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held both in Trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and Save As You Earn SAYE scheme, on which the dividends are being waived.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares in issue by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the Company may potentially issue relating to its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the LTIP and DBP, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2017 was the end of the contingency period.
Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Investment property Accounting policy Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the companies in the consolidated Group, is classified as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value.
Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specified asset.
If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections.
Investment property falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13.
Further details are given in Note 28.
Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of the property when it is probable that the future economic benefitsassociated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repair andmaintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the Groups investment properties are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
Where specific investment properties are expected to sell within the next 12 months their fair value is shown under assets classified as held-for-sale within current assets.
Any loss on the reclassification of these assets from investment properties to assets held-for-sale is charged to the income statement of the period in which this occurs.

Financial interest in property assets CHARM portfolio Accounting policy The CHARM portfolio is a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church of England Pensions Board as mortgagee.
It is accounted for under IAS 39 in accordance with the designation available-for-sale financial assets and is valued at fair value.
Itisinitially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the net change in value recorded is as follows: i the carrying value of the assets is increased by the effective interest rate: ii cash received from the instrument in the year is deducted from the carrying value of the assets: and iii the carrying value of the assets is revised to the net present value of the updated projected cash flows arising from the instrument using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition.
The change in value arising from i and iii above is recorded through the income statement and is shown on the line Income from financial interest in property assets.
Differences between the updated projected cash flows using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition compared to updated projected cash flows using a year end effective interest rate, assessed as the rate available in the market for an instrumentwith a similar maturity and credit risk, are taken through other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the assets.
When gains or losses in the assets are realised, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognisedin equity are included in the income statement as gains and losses from financial interest in property assets.

The key assumptions used to value the asset areset out within Note2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements, and the financial asset is included within the fair value hierarchy within Note 28.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 115 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 22.
Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets comprise computer software and goodwill.
IT software is amortised on a straight-line basis over 57 years being the estimated useful lives of the assets, from the date they are available for use.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement.
Goodwill is tested for impairment based on a value in use calculation at each reporting date.
Inventories Accounting policy Tenanted residential properties held-for-sale in the normal course of business are shown in the financial statements as a current asset at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes legal and surveying charges and introducer fees incurred during acquisition together with improvement costs.
Land and property held within the development segment of the business are shown in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents the acquisition price including legal and other professional costs associated with the acquisition together with subsequent development costs net of amounts transferred to costs of sale.
Net realisable value is the expected sales proceeds that the Group expects on sale of a property or current market value net of associated selling costs.
2017 2016 m m Residential trading property 797.6 818.8 Development trading property 43.7 85.5 841.3 904.3 It is not possible for the Group to identify which properties will be sold within the next 12 months.
The size of the Groups property portfolio does result in a relatively predictable vacancy rate.
However, it is not possible to predict in advance the specific properties that will become vacant.
Trading property is shown as a current asset in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group has an obligation, under an agreement for sale in relation to its land at West Waterlooville, to pay further consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts.
It also has an obligation under a profit sharing agreement to share profits above an agreed threshold.
It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future payments due to the long-term nature of the sites development and the associated uncertainties.
However, our current best estimate is that the earliest payment under these arrangements will not be before October November 2019 and any payments are likely to be spread over a number of years.
Amounts relating to inventories that have been recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Carrying value of trading property sold Note 8 100.6 63.4 Carrying value of construction contract expenses Note 8 26.9 24.1 Impairment of inventories to net realisable value 5.4 2.7 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 116 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 24.
Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment in trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Other receivables includes 29.0m due from land sales, which is receivable no later than July 2019.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are considered to be equal to their carrying amounts.
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired is discussed in Note 28 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when: i the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event: ii it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and iii a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Trade and other payables Accounting policy Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Accounting policy Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.
2017 2016 m m Current liabilities Bank loans Pounds Sterling 1.5 Non-bank financial institution 1.1 101.1 Corporate bond 0.6 1.1 99.0 Non-current liabilities Bank loans Pounds Sterling 637.7 435.6 Bank loans Euros 6.2 12.1 Non-bank financial institution 7.6 23.9 Corporate bond 273.1 273.1 924.6 744.7 Total interest-bearing loans and borrowings 925.7 843.7 a Bank loans Sterling bank loans include variable rate loans bearing interest at rates between 1.6% and 1.8% above LIBOR and Euro bank loans include variable rate loans bearing interest at a rate of 1.6% above EURIBOR.
The weighted average variable interest rate on bank loans as at 30 September 2017 was 2.0% 2016: 2.0%.
Bank loans are secured by fixed and floating charges over specific property and other assets of the Group.
Unamortised costs in relation to bank loans of 7.2m 2016: 5.9m will be amortised over the life of the loans to which they relate.
b Non-bank financial institution The 7.6m loan is funded by the Homes and Communities Agency and bears interest at 1% over the European Commission reference rate applicable to the UK.
c Corporate bond The 275m, 5.0% secured corporate bond, due December 2020, was issued in the financial year ended 30 September 2014.
The primary issue was 200m issued at par in November 2013 with a secondary tap issue in August 2014 of 75m issued at 101.125%.
The premium on the tap issue is being amortised to the income statement using the straight-line method.
Unamortised costs and the outstanding premium in relation to the corporate bond are, in total, 2.0m 2016: 2.6m and will be amortised over the remaining life of the bond.
d Other loans and borrowings information The above analyses of loans and borrowings are net of unamortised loan issue costs and the premium raised on the secondary tap issue of the corporate bond.
As at 30 September 2017, unamortised costs totalled 9.6m 2016: 9.0m and the outstanding premium was 0.4m 2016: 0.6m.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments Accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative instruments to help manage its interest rate risk.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group doesnot hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
Derivatives are classified as current assets and current liabilities.
The derivatives are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequently, the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, and have been designated as such, in which case any gain or loss is taken to equity in a cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on a discounted cash flow model using market information.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Derecognition is the point at which the Group removes an asset or liability from its statement of financial position.
The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires.
The Group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to another party provided that the transfer of the asset also transfers theright to receive cash flows from the financial asset.
When the transfer does not result in the Group transferring the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset but it does result in the Group assuming a corresponding obligation to pay cash flows toanother recipient, the financial asset is derecognised.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when its obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are the financial interest in property assets.
Derivative financial instruments not in hedge accounting relationships are classified as fair value through profit and loss.

The fair value of the bond is calculated as 299.8m 2016: 301.8m based on quoted prices in traded markets.
There is no requirement under IAS 39 to revalue these loans to fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Included in cash above is 11.3m 2016: 10.7m relating to cash held on behalf of tenants, leaseholders and clients comprising service charge amounts, sinking fund balances, tenant deposits and cash held on behalf of joint ventures.
These cash amounts are held by the Group in client bank accounts and are excluded from net debt.
In addition 29.0m 2016: 37.9m of the cash balance is restricted in use by underlying financing arrangements comprising either reserve fund amounts or amounts where the release of cash is contingent upon proof of qualifying expenditure.

The Groups policies on financial risk management are approved by the Board of Directors and implemented by Group treasury.
Written policies and procedures cover interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments andinvestment of excess liquidity.
Group treasury reports to the Audit Committee.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for speculative purposes.
The sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, which includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit availability risk, house price risk in relation to the Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio, our financial interest in property assets, and capital risk.
Financial risk factors 1 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The Groups principal financial assets include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
The Groups financial interest in property assets CHARM relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church ofEngland Pensions Board.
The Groups cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be lowrisk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
The Group sometimes enters into land sales contracts within the Development division under which a proportion of the consideration is deferred and recognised within other receivables Note 24.
Each purchaser is subject to financial due diligence prior to sale.
At 30 September 2017, 29.0m 2016: nil was outstanding.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 121 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The Group also has credit risk relating to trade receivables.
Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful, a provision for impairment is made.
For all assured shorthold tenancies, credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant.
Regulated tenants are incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy agreement to avoid default on their rent.
Lifetime tenancies are generally at low or zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk.
Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low, as is borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in prior years.
Tenant deposits of 2.5m 2016: 2.0m are held that provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations caused by the tenant.
The Group does not hold any other collateral as security.
Of the net trade receivables balance of 1.5m, we consider nilto be not due and not impaired.
We consider all of the 49.4m other receivables balance, and all of the 86.8m amounts recoverable on contracts as not due and not impaired.
As at 30 September 2017, tenant arrears of 0.6m within trade receivables were impaired and fully provided for 2016: 0.5m.
Theindividually impaired receivables are based on a review of outstanding arrears and an assessment of collectability.
Impaired receivables and receivables not considered to be impaired are not material to the financial statements and, therefore, no further analysis is provided.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the Groups policies of monitoring counterparty exposure, monitoring the concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of counterparties of good financial standing.
At 30 September 2017, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives that had a positive value was 3.4m 2016: 0.3m.
At 30 September 2017, the combined credit exposure arising from cash held at banks, money market deposits and interest rate swaps was 80.0m 2016: 80.3m, which represents 4.5% 2016: 5.0% of total assets.
Deposits were placed with financial institutions with Aor better credit ratings.
The Group has the following cash and cash equivalents: 2017 2016 m m Pounds Sterling 83.2 79.4 Euros 5.7 11.3 88.9 90.7 At the year end, 35.3m was placed on deposit 2016: 42.3m at effective interest rates between 0.2% and 0.3% 2016: 0.2% and 0.3%.
Remaining cash and cash equivalents are held as cash at bank or in hand.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 1.0m as at 30 September 2017 2016: 1.0m.
2 Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities.
Although the Groups core funding is subject to covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the entities in the Group of obligors, and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the Group level, the loan is not secured directly against any property allowing operational flexibility.
The Group has operated within its covenants during 2017 and as at 30 September 2017 seeNote 1 Accounting policies Going concern.
The Group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times.
The Group also ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks and other sources to allow for operational flexibility and to meet committed expenditure.
The business is highly cash generative from its sales of vacant properties, gross rents and management fees.
In adverse trading conditions, tenanted sales can be increased and new acquisitions can be stopped.
Consequently, the Group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.

The approach the Group takes to each of these risks is set out below.
The Group is not significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity price risk.
Fair values IFRS 13 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value.
These are as follows: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: 2017 2016 m Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Level 3 CHARM 86.1 93.1 Investment property 391.0 261.3 477.1 354.4 Level 2 Interest rate swaps in cash flow hedge accounting relationships 3.0 4.9 13.1 Interest rate caps not in cash flow hedge accounting relationships 0.4 0.3 Assets classified as held-for-sale 3.4 3.4 4.9 3.7 13.1 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 123 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The significant unobservable inputs affecting the carrying value of the CHARM portfolio are house price inflation and the effective interest rate.
Assumptions used are detailed in Note 2 and reconciliation of movements and amounts recognised in the income statement and other comprehensive income are detailed in Note 21.
The investment valuations provided by Allsop LLP and CBRE Limited are based on the RICS Professional Valuation Standards, but include a number of unobservable inputs and other valuation assumptions.
The fair value of swaps and caps were valued in-house by a specialised treasury management system, using first a discounted cash flow model and market information.
The fair value is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments.
As all significant inputs required to value the swaps and caps are observable, they all fall within Level 2.
Interest rate swaps and caps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap and cap contracts as at 30 September 2017 was 460.9m 2016: 462.2m.
In accordance with IAS 39, the Group has reviewed its interest rate hedges.
In the absence of hedge accounting, movements in fair value are taken directly to the income statement.
However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective, and have been designated as such, any gains or losses have been taken to the cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income.
The reconciliation between opening and closing balances for Level 3 is detailed in the table below: 2017 2016 Assets Level 3 m m Opening balance 354.4 205.2 Amounts taken to income statement 23.3 26.1 Transfer from Level 2 246.3 Other movements 99.4 123.2 Closing balance 477.1 354.4 The following assets and liabilities are excluded from the above table as fair value is not the accounting basis for the Groups financial statements, but is the basis for the Groups EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV measures: 2017 2016 m Accounting basis Classification if fair valued Book value Fair value Book value Fair value Inventories trading property Lower of cost and Level 3 841.3 1,487.1 904.3 1,553.7 net realisable value Corporate bond Amortised cost Level 1 275.0 299.8 275.0 301.8 In prior years, investment property has been included within Level 2.
However, as all inputs to their valuation on a property by property basis are not always observable, investment property is better shown within Level 3 and a transfer has been made in the prior year to reflect this.
a Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings.
The Group mitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps and caps.
This subjects the Group to fair value risk as the value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates.
However, the Group seeks to cash flow hedge account where applicable.
TheGroup is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk and is not driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving the best commercial arrangement.
Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the Groups hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure compliance with this policy.
The Board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
The current Group treasury policy is to maintain floating rate exposure of no greater than 30% of expected borrowing.
As at 30 September 2017, 79% 2016: 87% of the Groups net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 124 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 2.0m 2016: 1.8m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by 2.0m 2016: 1.8m.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the Groups equity by 9.9m 2016: 14.5m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease would decrease the Groups equity by 9.9m 2016: 14.5m.
Upward movements in medium and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the interest yield curve.
Where the Groups swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.
As at 30 September 2017, the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 is a net liability of 1.9m 2016: 13.1m.
No amount is recognised within the income statement for ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges 2016: nil.
The fair value movement on derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships resulted in a gain of 0.2m 2016: a charge of 9.9m in the income statement.
At 30 September 2017, the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 is a net asset of 0.4m 2016: 0.3m.
The cash flows occur and enter in the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises debt hedged: Hedged debt 2017 2016 m m Hedged debt maturing: Within one year 1.3 Between one and two years 1.3 Between two and five years 460.9 203.3 Over five years 256.3 460.9 462.2 Interest rate profile including the effect of derivatives and amortisation of issue costs 2017 2016 Weighted Weighted average Average Gross debt average Average Gross debt interest rate maturity Sterling Euros total interest rate maturity Sterling Euros total % years m m m % years m m m Fixed rate 5.2 3.3 275.0 275.0 5.2 4.3 275.0 275.0 Hedged rate 2.9 4.0 460.9 460.9 3.4 3.3 462.2 462.2 Variable rate 2.3 4.0 192.8 6.2 199.0 2.9 3.5 102.8 12.1 114.9 3.4 3.8 928.7 6.2 934.9 3.9 3.6 840.0 12.1 852.1 At 30 September 2017, the fixed interest rates on the interest rate swap contracts vary from 0.69% to 1.96% 2016: 0.69% to 1.96% : the weighted average rates are shown in the table above.
b Foreign exchange risk The Groups foreign exchange risk arises from the exposure due to translating overseas trading performance and overseas net assets into Sterling.
The Group does not have foreign currency trading with cross-border currency flows.
The Group hedges foreign currency assets naturally by funding them through borrowings in the applicable foreign currency and aims to ensure that it has no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.
Profit translation is not hedged.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The Groups statement of financial position translation exposure is summarised below: 2017 2016 Euros Euros m m Gross foreign currency assets 5.7 11.4 Gross foreign currency liabilities 6.2 12.1 Net exposure 0.5 0.7 As at 30 September 2017, it is estimated that a general increase decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling against the Euro would decrease increase the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.1m 2016: 0.4m and equity by nil 2016: nil.
c Credit availability risk Credit availability risk relates to the Groups ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms or to secure additional financing where necessary.
The Group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient headroom throughcash and committed borrowings.
On 30 September 2017, the Group had available headroom of 268.6m.
d House price risk The cash flows arising from the Groups financial interest in property assets CHARM and the Tricomm Housing portfolio are related to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements in house prices.
However, consistent with the Groups approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment properties, the Group does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the Groups business model.
e Capital risk management The Board manages the Groups capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections: the ability of the Group to meet contractual commitments: covenant tests: dividend cover: and gearing.
The current capital structure of the Group comprises a mixofdebt and equity.
Debt is both current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings as set out in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Group loans and borrowings have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios.
The Board regularly reviews all current and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom against keythresholds.
Loan to value is reviewed in the context of the Boards view of markets, the prospects of, and risks relating to, the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business.
The Group is now operating within a range of gearing of 4045%, which it considers to be appropriate in the medium term.
The Group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital WACC on a regular basis.
At 30 September 2017, the weighted average cost of debt was 3.4% 2016: 3.9%.
Investment and development opportunities are evaluated using a risk adjusted WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.

Pension costs Accounting policy i Defined contribution pension scheme Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period to which they relate.
ii Defined benefit pension scheme The Group currently contributes to a defined benefit pension scheme that was closed to new members and future accrual of benefits in 2003.
The full deficit in the scheme was recognised in the statement of financial position as at 1 October 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each statement of financial position date by a qualified actuary, also under the Projected Unit Credit Method, for the purpose of determining the amounts to be reflected in the Groups financial statements under IAS 19.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date less the fair value of scheme assets.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the statement of financial position date.
There are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and future accrual.
The net interest amount, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability, is reflected in the income statement each year.
Actuarial gains and losses net of deferred income tax are reflected in other comprehensive income each year.
a Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately fromthose of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Pension arrangements for Directors are disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee and the Directors Remuneration report on pages 62 to 78.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the Group.
The charge of 0.9m 2016: 1.0m is included within employee remuneration in Note 11. b Defined benefit scheme In addition to the above, the Group also operates a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by Trustees and are invested with Rathbones Investment Management Limited, an independent investment manager.
Pension benefits are linked to the members final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement date or date of leaving if earlier.
The Trustees are responsible for running the scheme in accordance with the schemes trust deed and rules, which sets out their powers.
The Trustees of the scheme are required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme.
There is a requirement that at least one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the scheme.
There are three categories of pension scheme members: Active members: currently employed by the Group.
Note no benefits have accrued since 30 June 2003, although active members retain a final salary link.
Deferred members: former employees of the Group.
Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the statement of financial position date.
In the period up to retirement, benefits receive increases linked to Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation subject to a cap of no more than 5% p. a.. After retirement, benefits receive fixed increases of 5% p. a.
The valuation method used is known as the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The approximate overall duration of the schemes defined benefit obligation as at 30September 2017 was 20 years.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the results of the actuarial valuation carried out as at 1 July 2016, updated to 30 September 2017, by a qualified independent actuary.

These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the schemes defined benefit obligation: however, this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk: some of the schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation subject to the appropriate caps in place.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy: if scheme members live longer than expected, the schemes benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the schemes defined benefit obligation.
The Trustees and Group manage risks in the scheme through the following strategies: Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
Market value of scheme assets The assets of the scheme are invested in a diversified portfolio as follows: 30 September 2017 30 September 2016 Market % of total Market % of total value scheme value scheme m assets m assets Equities 15.4 50% 12.2 41% Bonds 11.1 36% 11.7 40% Cash 0.4 1% 1.5 5% Insurance policies 3.9 13% 4.1 14% Total value of assets 30.8 100% 29.5 100% The actual return on assets over the year was 1.8 2.9 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 128 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information The assets of the scheme are held with Rathbones Investment Management Limited in a managed fund.
All of the assets listed have a quoted market price in an active market with the exception of the insurance policy asset where its value has been set equal to the secured pensioner liability.
The change in the market value of the scheme assets over the year was as follows: 2017 2016 m m Market value of scheme assets at the start of the year 29.5 26.9 Interest income 0.7 1.0 Employer contributions 0.5 0.6 Actuarial return on assets less interest 1.2 1.9 Benefits paid 1.1 0.9 Market value of scheme assets at the end of the year 30.8 29.5 The change in value of the defined benefit obligation over the year was as follows: 2017 2016 m m Value of defined benefit obligation at the start of the year 34.7 28.6 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 0.8 1.0 Actuarial gains: changes in demographic assumptions 2.1 Actuarial gains losses: changes in financial assumptions 1.6 8.1 Experience adjustment 1.8 Benefits paid 1.1 0.9 Value of defined benefit obligation at the end of the year 31.0 34.7 Amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 2017 2016 m m Actuarial return on assets less interest 1.2 1.9 Experience adjustment 1.8 Actuarial gain loss on defined benefit obligation 1.6 6.0 4.6 4.1 The gain shown in the above table of 4.6m 2016: loss of 4.1m has been included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 89.
Future funding obligation The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed by the Actuary for the Trustees as at 1 July 2016.
This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of 3.6m.
As a result of this valuation, the Group agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to pay additional contributions to eliminate the deficit by 30April2022.
Based on this plan, the Company expects to pay 0.6m p. a. to the scheme, until 30 April 2022.
In line with paragraph 23 of IFRIC 14, no additional liability is recognised as the additional contributions under the funding plan will reduce the future contributions payable into the scheme.
Sensitivity analysis Set out below is an analysis of how the scheme deficit would vary with changes to the key actuarial assumptions: Discount rate movement of 0.25% p. a.

Issued share capital Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Acquisition of and investment in own shares The Group acquires its own shares to enable it to meet its obligations under the various share schemes in operation.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own shares.
The acquisition cost ofthe shares is debited to an investment in own shares reserve within retained earnings.
Where the Group buys back its own shares as treasury shares it adopts the accounting as described above.
Where it subsequently cancels them, issued share capital is reduced by the nominal value of the shares cancelled and this same amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.

Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans comprising awards under a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, a Deferred Bonus Plan DBP, a Share Incentive Plan SIP and a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an employee expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options granted.
For market-based conditions, the probability of vesting is taken into account in the fair value calculation and no revision is made to the number of shares or options expected to vest.
For non-market conditions, each year the Group revises its estimate of the number of options or shares that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Awards that are subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
Awards not subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
When options are exercised the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium.

b DBP scheme Awards granted under the DBP scheme have no specific performance conditions other than the Company meeting its target for operating profit before valuation movements and non-recurring items OPBVM and employees in the scheme continuing to be employed.
There is a three-year vesting period from the date of grant.
One-third of the awards vest at the end of each year.
Participants can choose to exercise their awards on vesting or to retain their awards within the plan until the end of the third year at which point a 50% matching element is added to their award entitlement.
In addition to the normal DBP scheme, an enhanced DBP scheme EDBP is also provided.
The enhanced scheme operates in exactly the same way as the normal DBP scheme except that if participants retain their awards within the plan until the end of the fifth year, a further additional 50% matching award is added to their award entitlement.
Awards under the DBP EDBP have been valued based on the share price at the date of the award less the dividend yield at the award date as there is no entitlement to dividends during the vesting period.

Operating leases Accounting policy i Group as lessor Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The net present value of ground rents receivable is, in the opinion of the Directors, immaterial.
Accordingly, ground rents receivable are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Properties leased out to tenants are included in the statement of financial position as either investment property or as trading property under inventories.
ii Group as lessee The Group occupies a number of its offices as a lessee.
After a review of all of its occupational leases, the Directors have concluded that all such leases are operating leases.
Payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases net of any incentives from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
a Group as lessor The future aggregate minimum lease payments due to the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Operating lease payments due: Not later than one year 3.0 2.6 Later than one year and not later than five years 8.5 6.9 Later than five years 96.1 73.3 107.6 82.8 There are no contingent rents recognised within net rental income in 2017 or 2016 relating to properties where the Group acts as a lessor of assets under operating leases.
A significant proportion of the Groups non-cancellable operating leases relate to regulated tenancies under which tenants have the right to remain in a property for the remainder of their lives.
It is therefore not possible to estimate the timing of future minimum lease payments in respect of these regulated tenancies and so these are excluded from the above analysis.
