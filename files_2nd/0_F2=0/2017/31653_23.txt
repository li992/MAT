Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
General information The consolidated financial statements of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC the Company and its subsidiaries collectively, the Group for the year ended 30 September 2017 were authorised for issue by the Directors on 28 November 2017.
The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Company is registered in England and Wales.
The address of the registered office is 12 Smithfield Street, London EC1A 9BD.
The separate financial statements of the Company are also reported.
Note 16 identifies the subsidiaries that have taken advantage under s479A of the Companies Act 2006, of the exemption from audit.
The significant accounting policies have been disclosed below.
The accounting policies for the Group and the Company are consistent unless otherwise stated.
Application of new and r evised International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and changes in accounting policies a.
New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted In the current year, there have been no new standards, amendments or interpretations adopted that have had a material impact onthe disclosures or amounts reported in these financial statements.
Changes in accounting policies There have been no changes to accounting policies in the year.
c. New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective The table below sets out changes to accounting standards which will be effective for periods beginning on or after: Effective for period beginning on or after 1 January 1 IAS 7 Amendments to Disclosure Initiative 2017 1 IAS 12 Amendments to Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 2017 1 IFRS 2 Amendments to Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions 2018 1 IFRS 4 Amendments to Applying IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' with IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' 2018 IFRS 9 2014 Financial Instruments 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 2018 1 IFRS 15 Clarifications to Revenue from Contracts with Customers 2018 1 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 2018 1 IAS 40 Amendments to Transfers of Investment Property 2018 1 IFRS 16 Leases 2019 1 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 2019 1 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 2021 Annual 20142016 Cycle: Makes amendments to the following standards: IFRS 1, IFRS 12 2018 IFRS 1 and Improvements and IAS 28.
These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The Directors are reviewing the impact of these new standards, amendments and interpretations and do not intend to adopt the standards early.
It is not currently expected that these will have a material impact except for IFRS 16 Leases.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 the standard is yet to be endorsed by the EU.
The Group does not intend to adopt the standard early.
Therefore, it will first be applicable to the Groups accounting period ending 30 September 2020.
The standard represents a significant change in the accounting and reporting of leases for lessees as it provides a single lessee accounting model that replaces the current model where leases are either recognised as a finance or operating lease.
Under the single lessee model, a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability will be recognised which represent future lease payables, with movements through the Income Statement representing depreciation, additions or releases on the liability and unwinding of the discount for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the remaining lease term is less than twelve months at the date of transition.
Brewin Dolphin 90 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Accounting requirements for lessors are substantially unchanged from IAS 17 Leases.
Transition On transition to IFRS 16, the Group can choose to apply one of two transition methods: the full retrospective transition method, whereby IFRS 16 is applied to all its contracts as if it had always applied: or the modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients.
A practical expedient exists that allows an entity not to reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application of the standard.
Impact The Group is primarily a lessee and is also a sub-lessor for a small number of property leases that have been identified as onerous.
On adoption, lease agreements will give rise to both a right of use asset and a lease liability for future lease payables.
The right ofuse asset will be depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the asset and the lease term on a straight-line basis and recognised in the Income Statement.
The lease liability will be reduced by lease payments, offset by the unwinding of the liability over the lease term.
Interest recognised on the lease liability will be charged to the Income Statement.
The depreciation and interest charges will replace the lease costs currently charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis.
This will result in a change to the profile of the charge taken to the Income Statement over the life of the lease: higher expenses are recognised in earlier years of the lease, with a reduction in the annual expenses in the later years of the lease owingtothe application of the actuarial method of accounting for the lease liability.
An assessment of the impact of the new standard is currently being undertaken and work being performed includes an assessment of the accounting impacts of the change, the process of collecting the required data, identification of leases within the Group which fall within the scope of the standard and the necessary changes to systems and processes.
It is not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Groups consolidated results.
However, fromtheassessment to date, the Directors expect implementation of the new standard will have a material impact on the consolidated results of the Group.
The Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 58.7 million, see note 30.
It is likely that the Group will adopt the modified retrospective transition approach and take advantage of the practical expedient asdetailed above.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016 andsupersedes existing revenue recognition standards, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
The Group does not intend to adopt the standard early: therefore, it will first be applicable to the Groups accounting period ending 30 September 2019.
The new standard establishes a principle based five step model to be applied to all contracts with customers, except for insurance contracts, financial instruments and lease contracts.
The Group will be required to identify all contracts it has with customers in order to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
The Group is in the process of quantifying the potential impact of adopting the standard, based on its existing revenue streams.
The Group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of the new standard: it is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised under IFRS 15 in the Group financial statements, however it may result in changes to presentation and disclosure.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016.
The Group does not intend to adopt this standard early, therefore, it will first be applicable to the Groups accounting period ending 30 September 2019.
IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial instruments, the timing and extent of credit provisioning, new hedge accounting requirements and enhanced disclosures in the financial statements.
The Group does not use hedge accounting and so this element of the new standard is not applicable.
The Group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of the new standard: it is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on the Group financial statements.
However, the adoption of the standard will result in both the reclassification of certain financial assets and changes to disclosure.
co. uk Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements for both the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted by the European Union, Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and Companies Act 2006. b.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the goods and services.
c. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary.
Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated Income Statement from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC has taken advantage of the legal dispensation not to present its own Statement of Comprehensive Income or Income Statement.
The amount of the profit for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in the Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
d. Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the going concern statement and the Viability Statement included in the Strategic Report on page 37. e. Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred the excess is recognised immediately in the Income Statement as a bargain purchase gain.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
f. Transaction date accounting All securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
The underlying investments are not shown in the financial statements of the Group.
Brewin Dolphin 92 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information g. Foreign currencies In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are notretranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
h. Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents investment management fees, investment management commissions, financial planning income and other income, excluding VAT, receivable in the period.
Investment management and financial planning income Investment management fees and financial planning income are recognised in the period in which the related service is provided and commissions are recognised when the transaction is performed.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Income Statement to the extent that they represent a realised profit and loss for the Company.
Other operating income Interest receivable and payable on client money balances is netted to calculate the Groups share of interest receivable and included under the heading Other operating income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and bank overdrafts.
k. Leases Rentals on operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l. Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant.
Thefair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equitysettled share-based transactions are set out in note 29.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over thevesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Income Statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Significant accounting policies continued m. Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the current and deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
n. Investments in subsidiaries In the Companys financial statements investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
o. Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not reversed ina subsequent period see note 3 u for the Impairment accounting policy.
When the consideration transferred by the Group is deferred or contingent, this is valued at its acquisition date fair value, and is included in the consideration transferred in a business combination.
Changes in the deferred or contingent consideration, which occur in the measurement period, are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments to goodwill.
Subsequent to the measurement period, the deferred and contingent considerations are revised annually at the balance sheet date and any corresponding adjustments are posted to the Income Statement.
Brewin Dolphin 94 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information ii Client relationships Intangible assets classified as client relationships are recognised when acquired as part of a business combination or when separate payments are made to acquire funds by adding teams of investment managers.
Client relationships acquired separately are initially recognised at cost.
If acquired as part of a business combination the initial cost of client relationships is the fair value at the acquisition date.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
When separate payments are made to acquire funds by adding teams of investment managers, elements of the total consideration may be deferred or contingent.
In such cases the cost of the recognised client relationships includes the Companys best estimate of the future consideration likely to be made, discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and is revised at each balance sheet date.
Client relationships are amortised over seven to fifteen years, dependent upon the assessment of the estimated useful life of the client relationships.
iii Computer software Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware is classified as an intangible asset.
Costs of acquiring computer software are treated as an intangible asset and amortised over three to ten years, dependent upon the assessment of theexpected useful life of the software, on a straight-line basis from the date the software is operating as management intended.
The assessment of the expected useful life of computer software is based on the contractual terms or where appropriate past experience of the life of similar assets.
p. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment.
Depreciation has been provided on the basis of equal annual instalments to write off the cost less estimated residual values of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Computer equipment 3 to 4 years Office equipment 4 to 10 years Leasehold improvements to the earlier of the first break clause of the lease or 10 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement.
Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments and certain non-financial assets at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
Fairvalue for measurement and or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date: Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Significant accounting policies continued r. Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profitor loss are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
i Financial assets Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL : available-for-sale financial assets: and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets are classified as FVTPL where the financial asset is held-for-trading.
A financial asset is classified as held-for-trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future.
Financial assets classified as FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss on remeasurement recognised in the Income Statement.
The net gain or loss recognised in the Income Statement incorporates any dividends or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the Income Statement.
Their value is determined in the manner described in note 3 q. Available-for-sale financial assets AFS Certain assets held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value.
Unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market are stated at fair value where the directors consider that fair value can be reliably measured.
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 3 q.
Gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation reserve with the exception of permanent impairment losses which are recognised directly in the Income Statement.
Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the revaluation reserve is reclassified to the Income Statement.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in the Income Statement when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of the impairment.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Income Statement in the period.
In subsequent periods if the amount of impaired loss decreases, in respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in the Income Statement are not reversed through the Income Statement.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Brewin Dolphin 96 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information ii Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in the Income Statement.
The net gain or loss recognised in the Income Statement incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the other gains and losses line item in the Income Statement.
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note3 q.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
s. Netting of balances Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle on balance are shown net where there is a currently enforceable legal right toset off the recognised amounts and an operational intention to settle net.
Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle against delivery of stock are shown gross.
t. Post-retirement benefits i Costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Method, withactuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses andthe return on scheme assets excluding interest are recognised immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit to theStatement of Other Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurement recorded in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income is not recycled.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and net-interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs see note 9. ii Defined benefit pension scheme asset liability The defined benefit pension scheme asset liability recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit pension scheme obligation as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Any asset recognised is only recognised to the extent that the Group is able, without condition or restriction placed on it by the trustees, to run the Scheme until the last member dies, without benefits being augmented: wind up the Scheme at that point: and reclaim any remaining monies.
u. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Significant accounting policies continued For the purposes of impairment testing, client relationships and goodwill are allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Fair value is established by valuing clients funds in each of the cash-generating units at the period end: the percentages of funds being used depend on values attributed in recent public transactions for the purchase of advisory and discretionary funds.
If the carrying amount relating to any cash-generating unit exceeds the calculated fair value less costs to sell, a value in use is calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
v. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows where the effect of the time value of money is material.
Where some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received and the amount receivable can bemeasured reliably.
Onerous contracts Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions.
An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
w. Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.
Components of the Group are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered or settled principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable and the component is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Employee share ownership trusts Brewin Dolphin Limited is the sponsoring employer of the Brewin Dolphin Share Incentive Plan Trust and the Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Employee Share Ownership Trust.
The assets and liabilities of the trusts are recognised as those of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC and obligations of the trusts are regarded as obligations of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC.
Shares of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC held by the trusts are treated as own shares held and shown as a deduction in equity.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
Brewin Dolphin 98 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information a.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies i.
Business combinations The Group applies judgement in determining whether a transaction is a business combination, which includes consideration as to whether the Group has acquired a business or a group of assets.
In making this judgement, the Group assesses the assets, liabilities, operations and processes that were the subject of the transaction against the definition of a business in IFRS 3.
On 10 May 2017, the Groups principal operating subsidiary Brewin Dolphin Limited acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Duncan Lawrie Asset Management Limited DLAM.
It has been judged that the acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination given control of a separate legal entity was acquired and all of the value of the business was transferred.
See note 27 for additional information.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty i.
Business combinations As part of any business combination the Group recognises all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, including any separately identifiable intangibles assets such as the client relationship intangibles recognised as part of the DLAM acquisition as set out in note 4. a. i. above.
The value attributed to the client relationships affects the amount of goodwill recognised, this value together with the assessment of useful economic lives determines future amortisation charges.
The valuation of the client relationship intangible asset gives rise to estimation uncertainty.
Certain assumptions regarding the amount, timing and discounting of future cash flows have been adopted in order to determine these fair values.
The Group has recognised client relationship intangibles of 25,500,000 see note 14 and 27, arising from the DLAM business' relationship with its clients.
If the fair value of the assets acquired moved by 10% then the value of the client relationship intangibles acquired would decrease increase by 2,500,000 resulting in the recognition of either goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase.
Goodwill and client relationships Amortisation of client relationships The useful economic life over which client relationships are amortised is determined by the expected duration of the client relationships which are determined with reference to past experience of account closures, in particular the average life of those relationships, and future expectations.
During the year, client relationships were amortised over a 7 to 15 year period.
A reduction in the average amortisation period by one year would increase the amortisation expense for the year by 2,154,000 2016: 2,144,000.
Impairment of goodwill and client relationships Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit 'CGU' exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Group values the recoverable amount of goodwill and client relationships at the fair value less costs of disposal.
The calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal is based on the valuation of the funds, which make up the relevant intangible asset.
A percentage is applied to funds 3% for discretionary funds and 1% for advisory funds to determine the fair value.
These percentages have been based on recent public transactions.
Therefore, the recoverable amount is sensitive to movements in the valuation of funds.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 14.

Defined benefit pension scheme The calculation of the present value of the defined benefit pension scheme is determined by using actuarial valuations.
Management make key assumptions in determining the inputs into the actuarial valuations, which may differ from actual developments in the future.
These assumptions are governed by IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and include the determination of the discount rate, life expectancies, inflation rates and future salary increases.
Due to the complexities in the valuation, the defined benefit pension scheme obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
The detailed assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis, are set out in note 18.
During the year, the defined benefit pension scheme has moved from a deficit of 6,952,000 to a surplus of 4,487,000.
See note 18 page 112 Defined benefit pension scheme asset recognition basis for further detail.
Share-based payments Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The Group grants awards under the LTIP.
The scheme includes performance based vesting conditions, which impacts the amount of benefit paid.
The Group has made assumptions on the likelihood of meeting the performance conditions in determining the expense in the year.
If all of the performance conditions were assumed to be met: the charge for the year would increase by 637,000 2016: 1,692,000 : an absolute increase of 10% in the vesting assumptions would increase the charge for the year by 225,000 2016: 300,000.
Further information on the scheme is disclosed in note 29. v. Provisions Onerous leases The Group recognises a provision for several onerous property leases of 5,367,000 2016: 4,135,000.
The valuation of an onerous lease is based on the best estimate of the likely future costs discounted to present value.
Where the provision is in relation to premises and it is more likely than not that the premises will be sublet, an allowance for sublease income has been included in the valuation.
The ultimate amount of the provision is dependent on the timing of any sublet and the associated terms of the sublet achieved.
If the assumptions regarding unconfirmed sublet income are removed, the provision would increase by 7,958,000 2016: 6,355,000 to 12,094,000 2016: 10,490,000.
A delay of one year to the assumed sublets would increase the onerous lease provision and Income Statement expense for the year by 973,000.

Defined benefit pension scheme Group The Group operates a registered Defined Contribution Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Senior Staff Pension Fund and a registered Defined Benefit Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Limited RBS in the UK which both offer pensions in retirement and death benefits to members.
The disclosures provided are in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme only the Scheme.
Pension benefits are related to the members' final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The pension is payable for life and has elements increasing in payment in line with inflation up to a maximum of 5% p. a.
Since 1 April 2003 the Scheme has been closed to new members.
Members under age 55 at 1 April 2004 ceased to accrue further service in the Scheme from that date.
Contributions to the Scheme for the year beginning 1 October 2017 are expected to be 3.0 million.
The Scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
This means that the payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the Scheme is subject to the Scheme funding requirements outlined in Section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
The Scheme was established under trust and is governed by the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the Scheme has appointed Trustees.
Although the Group bears the financial cost of the Scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance of the Scheme lies with the Trustees, who have a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times.

Defined benefit pension scheme continued Valuation for funding purposes The valuation as at 31 December 2014: '000 Value of scheme assets 81,609 Actuarial value of scheme liabilities in respect of: In-service members 17,598 Deferred pensioners 31,459 Current pensioners and dependants 43,926 Value of scheme liabilities 92,983 Scheme deficit 11,374 Funding level 88% The Scheme is valued for funding purposes at intervals of not more than three years by an independent qualified actuary.
The latest valuation for funding purposes was as at 31 December 2014.
The actuarial valuation deficit is used to assess the money the Group need to put into the pension scheme.
The Group and the Schemes Trustees agreed a deficit reduction plan following the 2014 valuation and it was agreed that BrewinDolphin Limited would pay contributions of 250,000 per month from 1 January 2015 with a view to eliminate the deficit by28 February 2019.
The next actuarial valuation of the Scheme is due as at 31 December 2017 and a revised deficit reduction plan will be considered as part of this exercise.
The administration costs of the Scheme, including investment management fees and Scheme levy payments, are currently paid by Brewin Dolphin Limited as they fall due.
Summary of amounts recognised in the financial statements under IAS 19 In the consolidated financial statements, the Group accounts for pension costs, other post-retirement benefits and related redundancy provisions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Under the standard, the difference between the market values of Scheme assets and the present value of Scheme liabilities is reported as a surplus asset to the extent a surplus may be seen or deficit liability in the Balance Sheet.
The accounting value shown on the balance sheet will always be different from the result obtained using the funding basis.
The pension valuation under IAS 19 as at 30 September 2017 was carried out by a qualified independent actuary.
In the preparation of the valuations under IAS 19 referred to in this note, the actuary has used the assumptions indicated below, which the Group has directed for the purposes of accounting and disclosure under IAS 19.
Explanation of the variance between funding valuation and IAS 19 valuation The accounts show the Scheme has a surplus compared to the deficit revealed by the last funding valuation.
The main reasons for this are the difference between the experience of the Scheme over the period from 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2017 and that assumed for the purposes of the funding valuation as at 31 December 2014, and the differences in the assumptions used to value the liabilities in the accounting and funding valuations for the Scheme.
Defined benefit pension scheme asset recognition basis Under IAS 19 the net defined benefit pension scheme asset that can be recognised is the lower of the surplus and the asset ceiling i. e. the economic benefits available in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions or a combination of both, in accordance with IFRIC 14 IAS 19The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Under the Schemes Trust Deeds and Rules the Group is able, without condition or restriction placed on it by the Trustees, to run the Scheme until the last member dies, without benefits being augmented: wind up the Scheme at that point: and reclaim any remaining monies.
Consequently, the Group recognises the full surplus calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
Brewin Dolphin 112 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Risks The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the pension scheme are: Mortality risk the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the Scheme and consequently increases in the Schemes liabilities.
The Group and the Schemes Trustees review the mortality assumption on a regular basis to minimise this risk.
Investment risk the Scheme invests its assets in a diversified portfolio of assets.
There are risks that the assets underperform relative to increases in the value of the Schemes liabilities, thus increasing the cost to the Group of the benefit provision.
There is a risk that the assets invested in do not sufficiently match the characteristics of the Schemes liabilities and so a fall in asset values is not similarly matched by a fall in the value of the liabilities.
While certain assets are chosen that match the characteristics of the Schemes liabilities and membership profile, the Scheme currently invests in a high proportion of equities and assets that are not expected to closely match the majority of the Schemes liabilities.
The Schemes Trustees review the performance of the assets and structure of the portfolio on a regular basis to ensure the risks being taken under investment are commensurate with normal Trustee principles and the ability of the Group to mitigate adverse investment experience.
Price inflation risk some of the Schemes benefits increase in line with price inflation and so if inflation is greater than expected, the costs of providing these benefits will increase.
The Scheme holds government bonds with payments also linked to inflation to assist in mitigating this risk.
Financial derivatives risk the Scheme directly holds derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps, inflation swaps and total return swaps with the aim of enhancing how the Trustees' matching assets match changes in the Scheme's liabilities on the funding basis.
These are managed by the investment manager as well as all other assets and the Scheme Trustees determine the level of overall liability hedging that is employed.
Other than these derivatives used for liability matching and reducing risks, the Scheme does not directly hold any financial derivatives, but these may be held by some of the investment funds that the Scheme invests in.
The main risks associated with financial derivatives include: losses may exceed the initial margin: counterparty risk where the other party defaults on the contract: and liquidity risk where it may be difficult to close out a contract prior to expiry.
These risks are managed indirectly by the investment managers of the Scheme who will review the Scheme's return seeking assets and the level of investment risk taking to ensure it remains appropriate taking account of the Trustees' investment objectives.
The surplus recognised on the accounting basis is exposed to the risks that increases or decreases in the assets do not match those of the liabilities measured on the accounting basis.
The asset liability matching is based on the Scheme's funding basis and so to the extent that the Company's measure for the liabilities in line with IAS 19 requirements changes relative to the measure of the liabilities on the funding basis which the assets are hedging, this could impact on the accounting surplus.
The funding position on the funding basis is protected to some degree by the level of hedging that is adopted and the Trustees' plans to fide-risk in future years as the funding position improves.
Scheme investment strategy and level of matching The Schemes investment strategy is to invest broadly 80% in higher return seeking assets e. g. equities, high yielding bonds etc.
and 20% in matching assets e. g. fixed interest gilts and index-linked gilts.
The objective is to target an investment return of 2.5% per annum net of fees in excess of a portfolio of gilts that closely matches the behaviour of the Schemes funding liabilities.
This return objective will fall over time, as the proportion of matching assets are increased as the scheme matures, to 0.6% per annum net of fees once all the members have retired.
The Scheme also has liability matching swaps in place so that, along with the matching assets, the majority of the movement in the Schemes funding liabilities should be matched by similar movements in the assets.
This strategy reflects the Schemes liability profile and the Trustees and Brewin Dolphin Limiteds attitude to risk.
The asset allocations as at 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2016 are provided below, disaggregated between assets that are believed to have a quoted market price in an active market and those that are unquoted.
The aim of the Scheme is hedge around 85% of interest rate risk and inflation risk as at 30 September 2017 to reduce financial risks to the Scheme and the risks of additional contribution requirement for the Group.
The current longer-term objective is to aim to continue to hedge around 100% of both the interest rate risk and inflation risk of the liabilities: this will help to further reduce funding level volatility.
None of the assets of the pension schemes are invested in the Groups own financial instruments and none of the assets are properties or other assets used by the Group.

The weighted average duration of the liabilities is approximately twenty years.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme's defined benefit pension scheme obligation as at 30 September 2017 is set out below.
The sensitivities cover the key assumptions disclosed above.
The inflation assumption sensitivity factors in the impact of changes to RPI inflation which will impact on future expectations of increases in final pensionable salary which are capped at RPI increases, and pension increases and CPI inflation.
It should be noted that the methodology and assumptions prescribed for the purposes of IAS 19 mean that the disclosures will be inherently volatile, varying greatly according to investment market conditions at each accounting date.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 0.25% Increase by 5.2m Rate of inflation RPI, CPI and salary increases Increase by 0.25% Increase by 3.8m Assumed life expectancy Members live 1 year longer Increase by 4.3m The sensitivity figures have been calculated using the same method used for the calculation of the disclosed liabilities as at 30 September 2017.
There are no material limitations of the method used to calculate the sensitivities relative to the disclosed liabilities.

The timing of the settlements is unknown, but it is expected that they will be resolved within 12 months.
The onerous contracts provision at 30 September 2017 is solely in respect of surplus office space 30 September 2016: included a provision for 0.2 million in relation to onerous contracts resulting from discontinued operations.
The valuation of an onerous contract is based on the best estimate of the likely costs discounted to present value.
Where the provision is in relation to leasehold obligations on premises and it is more likely than not that the premises will be sublet, an allowance for sublease income has been included in the valuation.
The onerous lease charge for the year was 2.0 million 2016: 0.3 million of which 0.6 million related to changes in both assumptions of sublets and inputs used to calculate the provision.
In addition, following a review of office space utilisation of one of our properties, surplus office space was identified as onerous, resulting in an increase in the provision of 1.3 million.
Provision of 5.4 million 30 September 2016: 4.1 million has been made for surplus office space which the Group may not be able to sublet in the short term.
The maximum exposure is the current estimated amount that the Group would have to pay to meet the future obligations under these lease contracts which is approximately 13.4 million as at 30 September 2017 30 September 2016: 11.3 million, if the assumption regarding future sublets is removed and the time value of money is ignored.
The longest lease term covered by the provision has 15.5 years remaining and accounts for 3.7 million of the provision.
The Group has made a provision of 2.0 million 30 September 2016: 1.9 million for leasehold dilapidations.
These costs are expected to arise at the end of the lease.
The leases covered by the provision have a maximum remaining term of 15.5 years.
The social security and levies on share options provision is in respect of Employer's National Insurance on options outstanding at the end of the year.
The provision is based on the Groups share price, the amount of time passed and likelihood of the share options vesting and represents the best estimate of the expected future cost.
The provision recognised for the incentivisation awards of 0.6 million 30 September 2016: nil, which is based on the best estimate of the likely future obligation discounted for the time value of money, is payable to employees in relation to the retention and acquisition of funds.

It is not practicable to estimate the revenue and profit or loss of the combined entity for the current reporting year as though the acquisition date for BDDL had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period.
BDDL transferred the rights to the income streams to Duncan Lawrie Limited DLL, the former parent company, as part of a group reorganisation in December 2013.
From this date to the date of acquisition by the Group, any revenues and profit or loss associated with the client agreements were recognised in DLLs financial statements.
There is no way of identifying revenue and profit specific to BDDL recognised in the financial statements of DLL for the period from 1 October 2016 to the acquisition date.
In the opinion of the Directors disclosing an estimate of the BDDLs revenue and profit or loss for this year would be misleading and would not present a true and fair view of BDDLs performance.
Financial instruments and risk management Group and Company Overview This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the financial instrument key risks market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, the Groups policy and procedures for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for establishing and overseeing the Groups Risk Management Framework and risk appetite.
The Board has established a clear relationship between the Groups strategic objectives and its willingness to take risk through a Risk Appetite Statement.
The Risk Appetite Statement is an expression of limits qualitative and or quantitative giving clear guidance on the nature and quantum of risk that the Board wishes the Group to bear its risk appetite in order to achieve its strategic objectives whilst remaining within all regulatory constraints and its own defined levels of capital and liquidity.
The Board reviews the statement and related qualitative and quantitative measures on at least an annual basis to ensure the document continues to reflect the Boards appetite for risk within the context of the environment in which the Group operates.
The Groups Risk Committee provides oversight of the adequacy of the Groups Risk Management Framework based on the risks to which the Group is exposed.
It monitors how management complies with the Groups risk management policies and procedures.
It is assisted in the discharge of this duty by the Groups Risk & Compliance Department which has responsibility for monitoring the overall risk environment of the Group.
The Risk Committee also regularly monitors exposure against the Groups risk appetite.
The Groups Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the financial statements and working closely with the Risk Committee, for both review and oversight of internal controls.
The Audit Committee is assisted in the discharge of its obligations by Internal Audit, who undertake periodic and ad-hoc reviews on the effectiveness of controls and compliance with risk management policies.
The Groups risk management policies are intended to ensure that risks are identified, evaluated and subject to ongoing monitoring and mitigation where appropriate.
The risk management policies also serve to set the appropriate control framework.
The aim is to promote a robust risk culture with employees across the Group understanding their role and obligations under the framework.
Capital structure and capital management The capital structure of the Group and Company consists of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
Capital generated from the business is both reinvested in the business to generate future growth and returned to shareholders, principally in the form of dividends.
Capital adequacy is given a high level of focus to ensure not only that regulatory capital Brewin Dolphin 122 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information requirements are met, but that the Group is sufficiently capitalised against the risks to which it is currently exposed, as well as to withstand a range of potential stress events.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Regulatory capital requirements The Group conducts an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA to assess the appropriate amount of regulatory capital to be held by the Group.
There are two active regulated entities in the Group: Brewin Dolphin Limited BDL regulated by the FCA and Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.
The Jersey branch of BDL is regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.
The Pillar II capital assessment of the ICAAP is the Board of Directors opinion of the level of capital the Group should hold against the risks to which the Group is exposed.
The ICAAP is kept updated throughout the year to take account of changes to the profile of the risks facing the Group and for any material changes to strategy or business plans.
The ICAAP is discussed and approved at a Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Board meeting at least annually.
Regulatory capital adequacy is monitored by management.
The Group uses the standardised approach to credit risk to calculate Pillar I requirements.
The Group complied with the FCAs regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
The regulatory capital resources of the Group were as follows: 2017 2016 '000 '000 Share capital 2,833 2,830 Share premium account 152,320 151,836 Own shares 25,921 29,294 Revaluation reserve 85 24 Merger reserve 70,553 70,553 Profit and loss account 62,876 46,908 Regulatory capital resources before deductions 262,576 242,809 Deduction Intangible assets net of deferred tax liability 93,519 78,746 Deduction Defined benefit pension scheme asset net of deferred tax liability 3,724 Deduction Free deliveries 107 82 Total regulatory capital resources after deductions at 30 September 165,226 163,981 Information disclosure under Pillar III of the Capital Requirements Directive will be published on the Groups website before 31 December 2017 at www.

Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups market risk management is to both control and manage exposure within the Groups risk appetite whilst accepting the inherent risk of market fluctuations.
The Group undertakes trades on an agency basis on behalf of its clients.
The Group holds financial instruments as principal, but does not trade as principal.
All trades are matched in the market see note 17.

Equity price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk arising from both available-for-sale and held-for-trading investments.
Equity price sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
If equity prices had been 5% higher lower: Pre-tax profit for the year ended 30 September 2017 would have been 1,800 higher lower 2016: 52,000 higher lower due to changes in the value of held-for-trading investment: and Other equity reserves as at 30 September 2017 would increase decrease by 4,800 2016: increase decrease by 6,400 pre-tax for the Group as a result of the changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments.
The Groups sensitivity to equity prices has not changed significantly from the prior year.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of the Groups cash and in respect of client deposits.
The Group holds client deposits on demand and in 30 day notice accounts variable interest rates.
