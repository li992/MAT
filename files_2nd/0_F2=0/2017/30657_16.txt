Strategic report STRATEGIC REPORT PLATINUM PLATINUM Anglo American is the leading primary producer of platinum group metals, extracting and processing around 40% of all newly mined platinum.
All of our operations are located in the Bushveld Complex in South Africa, with the exception of Unki mine on the Great Dyke formation in Zimbabwe.
HIGHLIGHTS KEY PRIORITIES INCREASE IN UNDERLYING EBITDA Contain unit costs to between R19,600 and R20,200 per platinum ounce produced metal in concentrate Chris Griffith CEO 63% Complete construction of the Unki smelter Platinum Advance expansion of the Amandelbult chrome plant UNDERLYING EBITDA Continue to develop the market for PGMs.
$866 million RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED 10% THE ROLE OF PLATINUM IN A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE an internal combustion engine ICE and a battery, PGMs will remain in high demand as the catalysts require metal loadings similar to those found in current ICE cars.
Looking further ahead, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles FCEVs offer a zero emissions alternative to ICE vehicles, without the need for consumers to change their behaviour.
Platinum is used in FCEVs as the catalyst which turns hydrogen gas into electrical power.
We believe that our actions can help shape this demand in the future.
We are a founding member of the Hydrogen Council, a global initiative of leading energy, transport and industry companies that is leading the way in the transition from fossil fuel based sources of power.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW OPERATING PERFORMANCE Underlying EBITDA increased by 63% to $866 million Total platinum production metal in concentrate, 2016: $532 million, largely as a result of higher sales including both own-mined production and purchase volumes platinum, palladium and some minor metals of concentrate, increased by 1% to 2,397,400 ounces and stronger prices for palladium and rhodium.
Total palladium production local currency costs, driven by ongoing cost improvement metal in concentrate, including both own-mined initiatives, were offset by the stronger South African production and purchase of concentrate, was also 1% rand, resulting in an 8% increase in US dollar costs to higher at 1,557,300 ounces 2016: 1,538,700 ounces.
Production from own-managed mines Platinum produced from own-managed mines, MARKETS excluding projects, increased by 3% to 1,130,900 ounces 2017 2016 2016: 1,096,200 ounces, while palladium production Average platinum market price $ oz 950 989 grew by 7% to 847,200 ounces 2016: 789,600 ounces.

strong demand, supported a stronger basket price in both dollars and rand, despite a lower average platinum price Amandelbult complex yielded 438,000 ounces of platinum during the year.
2016: 458,600 ounces and 202,500 ounces of palladium 2016: 207,300 ounces, representing decreases of 4% and F or more information, refer to the Marketplace review section See pages 11-13 2% respectively.
This was caused primarily by excessive rainfall in the first quarter, which constrained production from the surface operations, lower immediately available Ore Reserves, and increased development as the mine makes its transition from the Tumela Upper to the Dishaba Lower mining areas.
Production was further affected by three fatal incidents and their subsequent associated safety stoppages.
Unki mine in Zimbabwe maintained its platinum production level for the year at 74,600 ounces 2016: 74,500 ounces, while raising its palladium output by 5% to 64,400 ounces 2016: 61,400 ounces.
This performance was largely driven by more efficient mining, which reduced waste mining, resulting in higher-grade ore being delivered to the concentrator.
Owing to planned maintenance at the concentrator in the fourth quarter, Unki had an ore stockpile at the end of 2017, which will be processed in 2018.

No further third-party purchase of concentrate is currently expected from the Joint venture production Maseve mine.
Platinum and palladium production from the Mototolo, Modikwa and Kroondal joint ventures, inclusive of both Refined production own-mined share and purchase of concentrate production, Refined platinum production increased by 8% to 2,511,900 decreased by 3% and 1% respectively, to 490,600 ounces ounces 2016: 2,334,700 ounces, and refined palladium of platinum 2016: 505,600 ounces and 323,100 ounces production by 14% to 1,668,500 ounces 2016: 1,464,200 of palladium 2016: 327,800 ounces.
Refined production in 2016 was materially affected largely due to the stoppage of the Mototolo concentrator by a Section 54 safety stoppage at the Precious Metals for remedial work to stabilise the tailings storage facility.
Refinery, as well as by a run-out at the Waterval smelter in This resulted in a 27% reduction in platinum output to September of that year: the subsequent recovery from 85,300 ounces 2016: 116,700 ounces and a 26% these developments was largely responsible for the reduction in palladium output to 52,500 ounces increase in output in 2017.

Kroondals production Platinum sales volumes increased by 4% to 2,504,600 was slightly higher owing to increased underground ounces 2016: 2,415,700 ounces, while palladium sales productivity, with platinum and palladium production both volumes rose by 3% to 1,571,700 ounces 2016: 1,532,100 2% higher at 278,600 ounces 2016: 274,100 ounces and ounces, in line with higher refined production.
Purchase of concentrate from associates OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK Total platinum production from associates decreased by 5% to 265,500 ounces 2016: 279,300 ounces, while Platinum production metal in concentrate for 2018 palladium production was 10% lower at 127,900 ounces is expected to be 2.3-2.4 million ounces.
Palladium production metal in concentrate for 2018 BRPM produced 211,900 ounces of platinum is expected to be 1.5-1.6 million ounces.
2016: 195,900 ounces and 87,600 ounces of palladium 2016: 81,300 ounces, both increasing by 8%, as the Styldrift project continued its ramp-up.
On 31 October 2017, Bokoni mine was placed onto care and maintenance by Platinums joint venture partner, Atlatsa Resources, resulting in a 36% reduction in platinum output to 53,600 ounces 2016: 83,400 ounces and a 33% decrease in palladium output to 40,300 ounces 2016: 60,400 ounces.
No further loss-making production will be produced from Bokoni while the mine and concentrator remain on care and maintenance.
