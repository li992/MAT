The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: Investment Trust and Rooper & Management tax Whately Total 000 000 000 000 Cost At 1 January 2016, 2017 and 31 December 2017 62,091 1,954 227 64,272 Impairment At 1 January 2016 666 666 Charge in the year 141 141 At 1 January 2017 807 807 Charge in the year 283 283 At 31 December 2017 1,090 1,090 Carrying amount at 31 December 2017 62,091 864 227 63,182 Carrying amount at 31 December 2016 62,091 1,147 227 63,465 Carrying amount at 1 January 2016 62,091 1,288 227 63,606 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are assessed using value-in-use calculations.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the board, covering the forthcoming and future years.
The key assumptions underlying the budgets are that organic growth rates, revenue margins and profit margins are in line with recent historical rates and equity markets will not change significantly in the forthcoming year.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to 10 years based on annual revenue growth for each CGU see table below : as well as the group's expectation of future industry growth rates.
A 10 year extrapolation period is chosen based on the group's assessment of the likely associated duration of client relationships.
The group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU is shown in the table below: these are based on a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
The group judges that these discount rates appropriately reflect the markets in which the CGUs operate and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax CGU.
Investment Management Trust and tax Rooper & Whately At 31 December 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Discount rate 11.1% 9.3% 13.1% 11.3% 11.1% 9.3% Annual revenue growth rate 5.0% 4.0% 1.0 % 1.0 % 0.0% 0.0% At 30 June 2017, the group recognised an impairment charge of 283,000 in relation to goodwill allocated to the trust and tax CGU.
An impairment was recognised, as the recoverable amount of the CGU at 30 June 2017 was 864,000, which was lower than the carrying value of 1,147,000 at 31 December 2016.
The recoverable amount was calculated based on forecast earnings for 2017, extrapolated over 10 years based on a decrease in revenues of 1.0% per annum.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 14.0%.
The impairment was recognised in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis.
No further impairment was recognised at 31 December 2017.
Based on the assumptions in the table above, the calculated recoverable amount of the trust and tax CGU at 31 December 2017 was 1,181,000: this was higher than its carrying value of 864,000.
Reducing the assumed growth rate for income in the trust and tax CGU by one percentage point would reduce the calculated recoverable amount of the CGU to 828,000.
No reasonably foreseeable changes to the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for the investment management CGU would result in an impairment of the goodwill allocated to it.

These amounts have been capitalised see note 21.
Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations Deferred and contingent consideration of 1,220,000 2016: 1,136,000 is the present value of amounts payable at the end of 2019 in respect of the acquisition of Vision Independent Financial Planning and Castle Investment Solutions.
Legal and compensation During the ordinary course of business the group may, from time-to-time, be subject to complaints, as well as threatened and actual legal proceedings which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties both in the UK and overseas.
Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to the groups best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date.
The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties.
Property-related Property-related provisions of 13,743,000 relate to dilapidation and onerous lease provisions expected to arise on leasehold premises held by the group 2016: 2,798,000 dilapidations.
The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office was completed on 13 February 2017, which triggered the recognition of a provision for the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing leases.
The ultimate amount of the provision is dependent on the timing of any subletting or assignment arrangements and the associated terms negotiated with prospective third parties.
Based on management's expectations of future costs for the premises and potential rental income, and timings thereof, the group recognised a provision of 16,265,000.
The group utilised 4,787,000 2016: nil of the onerous lease provision during the year, being the payment of rent, rates and service charge.
Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model: during the year ended 31 December 2017, dilapidation provisions decreased by 533,000 2016: increased 1,003,000.
The group utilised 802,000 2016: nil of the dilapidations provision held for the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street during the year.
The impact of discounting led to an additional 82,000 2016: 1,003,000 being provided for over the year.
Amounts payable after one year Property-related provisions of 7,949,000 are expected to be settled within 19 years of the balance sheet date, which corresponds to the longest lease for which a dilapidations provision is being held.
Provisions for deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations of 1,220,000 are expected to be settled within two years of the balance sheet date.
Remaining provisions payable after one year are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date.

Interest is payable at a fixed rate of 5.856% until the first call option date and at a fixed margin of 4.375% over 6 month LIBOR thereafter.
An interest expense of 1,276,000 2016: 1,269,000 was recognised in the year see note 4.
27 Long-term employee benefits The group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to these schemes during the year was 6,213,000 2016: 4,595,000.
The group also operates a defined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 47,000 2016: 40,000.
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes: the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Retirement Benefit Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes' beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
With effect from 30 June 2017, the link between past service benefit and pensionable salaries was broken for both schemes and the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to future accrual from this date.
This resulted in a plan amendment gain of 5,523,000 being recognised in operating income on that date.
The group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 1,167,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year 2016: 1,134,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2013 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2013 During 2017, triennial valuations of both schemes as at 31 December 2016 were being carried out.
These valuations are yet to be formally finalised.
The assumptions used by the actuaries, to estimate the schemes' liabilities, are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
Due to the timescale covered by the liability, these assumptions may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
com 143 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Long-term employee benefits continued The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: Laurence Keen Scheme Rathbone 1987 Scheme 2017 2017 2016 2016 % % % % unless stated unless stated unless stated unless stated Rate of increase of salaries n a 4.50 n a 4.50 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.60 3.60 3.40 3.40 3.50 3.50 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 3.50 3.50 Discount rate 2.65 2.80 2.65 2.80 Inflation 3.50 3.50 3.50 3.50 Percentage of members transferring out of the schemes per annum 3.00 3.00 3.00 3.00 Average age of members at date of transferring out years 52.5 52.5 52.5 52.5 Inflation assumptions are based on the Retail Price Index Over the year, the financial assumptions have been amended to reflect changes in market conditions.
Specifically: 1. the discount rate has been decreased by 0.15% to reflect a decrease in the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds at a term consistent with the average duration of the liabilities: 2. the assumed rate of future inflation is unchanged and reflects expectations of long-term inflation as implied by changes in the fixed-interest and index-linked gilts market: 3. the assumed rates of future increases to pensions in payment are unchanged, consistent with the assumed rate of future inflation.
Over the year the demographic assumptions adopted remain unchanged, other than updating the CMI model used to project future improvements in mortality from the 2013 version to the 2016 version.
The assumed duration of the liabilities for the Laurence Keen Scheme is 16 years 2016: 20 years and the assumed duration for the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 20 years 2016: 24 years.
The normal retirement age for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme is 65 60 for certain former directors.
The normal retirement age for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 60 for service prior to 1 July 2009 and 65 thereafter, following the introduction of pension benefits based on Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE from that date.
The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the S2NA actuarial tables 2016: S2NA tables.
The assumed life expectations on retirement were: 2017 2016 Males Females Males Females aged 60 Retiring today: 28.5 30.6 29.3 31.5 aged 65 23.7 25.6 24.3 26.5 aged 60 Retiring in 20 years: 30.4 32.4 31.8 33.9 aged 65 25.4 27.4 26.6 28.8 The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the groups assets in respect of the schemes is as follows: 2017 2016 Laurence Keen Rathbone Laurence Keen Rathbone Scheme 1987 Scheme Total Scheme 1987 Scheme Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Present value of defined benefit obligations 12,980 151,133 164,113 16,203 216,238 232,441 Fair value of scheme assets 12,278 136,235 148,513 14,099 178,887 192,986 Net defined benefit liability 702 14,898 15,600 2,104 37,351 39,455 144 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 144 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 Consolidated financial statements The amounts recognised in profit or loss, within operating expenses, are as follows: 2017 2016 Laurence Keen Rathbone Laurence Keen Rathbone Scheme 1987 Scheme Total Scheme 1987 Scheme Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Current service cost 1,559 1,559 3,022 3,022 Net interest on net liability 59 957 1,016 1 35 36 Gain on plan amendment 305 5,218 5,523 246 2,702 2,948 1 3,057 3,058 Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability have been reported in other comprehensive income.
The actual return on scheme assets was a rise in value of 1,170,000 2016: 2,018,000 rise for the Laurence Keen Scheme and a rise in value of 13,558,000 2016: 31,353,000 rise for the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
com 145 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Long-term employee benefits continued The statements of investment principles set by the trustees of both schemes were revised in 2015.
They require that the assets of the schemes are invested in a diversified portfolio of assets, split between return seeking assets primarily equities and safer assets gilts, index-linked gilts, corporate bonds and other fixed income investments with a switch to a greater percentage of safer assets over time as the schemes mature.
In the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, the target date for the 100% allocation to safer assets is 31 December 2048.
The scheme also seeks to hedge around 50% of its interest rate and inflation risk by using Liability Driven Investment LDI strategies.
In the Laurence Keen Scheme the target date for the 100% allocation to safer assets is 31 December 2040.
The expected asset allocations at 31 December 2017 as set out in the statements of investment principles are as follows: Laurence Keen Rathbone Scheme 1987 Scheme Target asset allocation at 31 December 2017 % % Benchmark Return seeking assets 52 40 Growth assets 48 60 Range Return seeking assets 46 58 32 44 Growth assets 42 54 54 66 The analysis of the scheme assets, measured at bid prices, at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 Fair Fair Current Current value allocation value allocation Laurence Keen Scheme 000 000 % % Equity instruments: United Kingdom 3,722 4,178 Eurozone 409 358 North America 755 921 Other 558 710 5,444 6,167 45 44 Debt instruments: United Kingdom government bonds 4,482 5,413 United Kingdom corporate bonds 1,686 1,918 6,168 7,331 50 52 Cash 283 10 2 383 3 Other 591 4 At 31 December 12,278 14,099 100 100 146 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 146 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 Consolidated financial statements 2017 2017 2016 2016 Fair Fair Current Current value allocation value allocation Rathbone 1987 Scheme 000 000 % % Equity instruments: United Kingdom 41,736 57,134 Eurozone 6,016 8,807 North America 9,422 14,486 Other 7,168 12,384 64,342 47 92,811 52 Debt instruments: United Kingdom government bonds 36,069 35,836 Overseas government bonds 1,973 3,670 United Kingdom corporate bonds 10,100 17,505 Overseas corporate bonds 1,010 48,142 58,021 35 32 Derivatives: Interest rate swap funds 20,222 17,365 20,222 17,365 15 10 Cash 3,529 9,885 3 6 Other 805 At 31 December 136,235 100 178,887 100 During 2017, the Rathbone 1987 Scheme held shares in real time inflation-linked interest rate swap funds, which had a fair value of 20,222,000 at the year end 2016: 17,365,000.
The value of these investments is expected to increase when the value of the scheme's liabilities increase and vice versa.
They therefore act to reduce the group's exposure to changes in net defined benefit pension obligations arising from changes in interest rates and inflation.
The funds are selected so that their average duration is intended to broadly align with the duration of the scheme's liabilities.
All equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.
The majority of government bonds are issued by governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Germany all of which are rated AAA, AA or AA, based on credit ratings awarded by Fitch Ratings Limited Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys as at the balance sheet date.
Other scheme assets comprise commodities and property funds, both of which also have quoted prices in active markets.
The key assumptions affecting the results of the valuation are the discount rate, future inflation, mortality, the rate of members transferring out and the average age at the time of transferring out.
In order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme by varying each of these assumptions in isolation whilst leaving the other assumptions unchanged.
For example, in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the discount rate, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme using a discount rate that is 0.5% higher than used for calculating the disclosed figures.
A similar approach has been taken to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the other key assumptions.
A summary of the sensitivities in respect of the total of the two schemes defined benefit obligations are set out below.
Combined impact on schemes' liabilities Decrease increase Decrease increase '000 % 0.5% increase in: discount rate 16,124 9.8 rate of inflation 7,323 4.5 1% increase in the rate of members transferring out each year 449 0.3 1 year increase to: longevity at 60 6,759 4.1 average age of members at the time of transferring out 574 0.3 rathbones.
com 147 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Long-term employee benefits continued The total regular contributions made by the group to the Rathbone 1987 Scheme during the year were 856,000 2016: 2,558,000 based on 20.3% of pensionable salaries 2016: 20.3%.
Additional lump sum contributions of 2,838,000 were paid in 2017 2016: 2,917,000.
The group is not committed to making any further deficit reduction contributions as at the year end.
As part of the ongoing triennial valuation, the group has agreed with the trustees of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme to put in place a funding deficit reduction plan, which requires annual contributions of 2,750,000, so long as that scheme remains in deficit.
The deficit funding plan will be reviewed following the next triennial valuation, as at 31 December 2019.
The total contributions made by the group to the Laurence Keen Scheme during the year were nil 2016: nil.
No additional lump sum contributions were paid in 2017 2016: nil, and the group has no commitment to make further contributions.
Regular contributions to the Laurence Keen Scheme stopped with effect from 1 January 2015.
Although the funding valuation for the Laurence Keen Scheme as at 31 December 2016 has not yet been finalised, the group does not expect that material funding deficit contributions will be required.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time-to-time, and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the company.
The ordinary shareholders are entitled to any residual assets on the winding up of the company.

30 Share-based payments Share Incentive Plan The group operates a Share Incentive Plan SIP, which is available to all employees.
Employees can contribute up to 150 per month to acquire partnership shares, which are purchased or allotted twice a year at the end of six month accumulation periods.
The group currently matches employee contributions on a one-for-one basis to acquire matching shares.
The group also provides performance-related free shares, with eligible employees receiving shares valued at the rate of 100 per 1% real increase in earnings per share up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum.
For UK employees, SIP dividends are reinvested and used to purchase dividend shares, whilst for Jersey employees dividends are paid in cash.
As at 31 December 2017, the trustees of the SIP held 1,092,120 2016: 1,243,979 ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 28,330,000 2016: 24,668,000.
Of the total number of shares held by the trustees, 263,165 2016: 294,680 have been conditionally gifted to employees and 10,777 2016: 1,525 remain unallocated.
Dividends on the unallocated shares have been waived by the trustees.
Savings-related share option or Save As You Earn SAYE plan Under the SAYE plan, employees can contribute up to 500 per month to acquire shares at the end of a three or five year savings period.
Options with an aggregate estimated fair value of 625,000, determined using a binomial valuation model including expected dividends, were granted on 28 April 2017 to directors and staff under the SAYE plan.
The inputs into the binomial model for options granted during 2017, as at the date of issue, were as follows: 2017 2016 Share price 2,351p 2,033p Exercise price 1,899p 1,648p Expected volatility 20% 21% Risk-free rate 0.2% 0.7% Expected dividend yield 2.4% 2.7% rathbones.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted average contractual life of 2.3 years 2016: 2.5 years and a weighted average exercise price of 16.20 2016: 15.18.
Executive Incentive Plan Details of the general terms of this plan are set out in the remuneration committee report on page 86.
Under the remuneration policy, 40% of the total award will be given in cash with the remaining 60% of the award granted in shares.
The group treats the cash element of the award as an employee benefit under IAS 19 and the share element of the award as an equity-settled share-based payment under IFRS 2.
Other schemes The group operates a number of other plans for rewarding employees.
Participants are granted awards under these plans in the form of options, which vest automatically on an anniversary of the grant date generally between one and five years.
As the intention is to settle the options in such plans in shares, the awards are treated as equity-settled share-based payments under IFRS 2.
The group recognised total expenses of 3,871,000 in relation to share-based payment transactions in 2017 2016: 5,201,000 see note 10.
150 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 150 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 Consolidated financial statements 31 Financial risk management The group has identified the financial, business and operational risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the group risk committee report on pages 68 to 69.
The group categorises its financial risks into the following primary areas: i credit risk which includes counterparty default risk : ii liquidity risk: iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk : and iv pension risk.
The group's exposures to pension risk are set out in note 27.
The groups financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the group faces, to set appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-todate information systems.
The group regularly reviews its financial risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The treasury department, reporting through the banking committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a group treasury manual and policy documents prescribe the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the groups risk appetite.
i Credit risk The group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and financial planning activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds in the money market and holding interest-bearing securities.
The group also has exposure to credit risk through its client loan book and guarantees given on clients behalf.
It is the groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high-quality financial institutions and the Bank of England.
Investments with financial institutions are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch or Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
The group's financial assets are categorised as follows: Balances with central banks note 14 The group has exposure to central banks through its deposits held with the Bank of England.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
The Investment Management and Unit Trusts segments have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances arising in the Investment Management segment are primarily in relation to client trades and risk of non-settlement is borne by clients.
com 151 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued Loans and advances to banks note 15 and debt and other securities note 17 The group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds and treasury bills.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of clients' cash, where it is held under a banking relationship, and the groups own reserves.
The groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long term rating of single A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis by the treasury department and reviewed by the banking committee on a monthly basis, or more frequently when necessary.
The banking committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers note 16 The group provides loans to clients through its investment management operations 'the investment management loan book'.
The group is also exposed to credit risk on overdrafts on clients' investment management accounts, trade debtors arising from the trust, tax and financial planning businesses 'trust and financial planning debtors' and other debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time-to-time due to short term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on a client's behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the banking committee on a monthly basis.
b Investment management loan book Loans are provided as a service to investment management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name, and some loans may be partially secured by property.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted subject to credit criteria.
At 31 December 2017, the total lending exposure limit for the investment management loan book was 175,000,000 2016: 150,000,000, of which 120,433,000 had been advanced 2016: 106,276,000 and a further 30,025,000 had been committed 2016: 31,642,000. c Trust and financial planning debtors Trust and financial planning debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and financial planning debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the management committees of the groups trust and financial planning businesses.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
d Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers relate to management fees receivable.
Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually, or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case by case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any security and or collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and financial planning debtors, are set out in note 16.

For on-balance sheet assets, the exposures set out above are based on gross carrying amounts.
9.5% of the total maximum exposure is derived from loans and advances to banks and customers 2016: 10.1% and 31.4% represents investment securities 2016: 36.0%.
The credit risk relating to off-balance sheet exposures for financial guarantees reflects the group's gross potential exposure of guarantees held on balance sheet see note 1.21.

At 31 December 2017, all loans are subject to standard lending criteria 2016: all loans.
An exposure is reported as past due when the contractual due date for settlement has passed and the balance has not been repaid, except in the case of trust and financial planning debtors, where a normal settlement period of up to 30 days is expected.
b Past due but not impaired Loans and advances that are past due are assessed for impairment and provided against where objective evidence of impairment exists.
Trust and financial planning debtors may be outstanding for some time before collection, but this is not necessarily an indication that the debt will not ultimately be collected.
At 31 December 2017 and 2016, no overdrafts, loans and other debtors were past due but not impaired.

There were no other impaired credit exposures at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
Investment securities The table below presents an analysis of investment securities by rating agency designation, as at 31 December, based on Fitch or Moodys long term rating designation.
The banking committee actively monitors counterparties and may reduce risk by either suspending dealing or liquidating investments in light of adverse market information, for example in anticipation of or in response to any formal Fitch or Moodys rating downgrade.
This may happen in relation to specific banks or banks within a particular country or sector.
a Geographical sectors The following table analyses the groups credit exposures, at their carrying amounts, by geographical region as at the balance sheet date.

The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements.
In addition to setting the treasury policy, Rathbone Investment Management 'the Bank' performs an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA our Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment.
The Bank faces two principal risks, namely that a significant proportion of client funds are withdrawn over a short period of time retail funding risk and the risk that marketable assets may not be capable of being realised in the time and at the value required marketable assets risk.
Retail funding risks are monitored by daily cash mismatch analyses and Basel Committee ratios using expected cash and asset maturity profiles and regular forecasting work.
This is supported by stress tests which cover firm-specific idiosyncratic scenarios and or the effects of unforeseen market wide stresses.
Marketable assets risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The group operates strict criteria to ensure that investments are liquid and placed with high-quality counterparties.
A minimum liquid assets buffer to be held in eligible liquid assets is set by the board at least annually in conjunction with an amount prescribed by the PRA.

com 159 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk Interest rate risk Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the banking committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is rising and shortens it when the yield curve is falling.
The table below shows the consolidated repricing profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest-bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2017, the Bank had a net present value sensitivity of 4,310,000 2016: 3,696,000 for an upward 2% shift in rates.
The group held no forward rate agreements at 31 December 2017 2016: none.
Foreign exchange risk The group is exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as it undertakes transactions in foreign currencies and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts, from time-to-time, so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The group has no structural foreign currency exposure.
com 161 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk continued Foreign exchange risk continued The group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk.
The table below summarises the groups exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December 2017.
Included in the table are the groups financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.
A 10% weakening of the euro against sterling, occurring on 31 December 2017, would have reduced equity and profit after tax by 104,000 2016: reduced by 30,000.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar or euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
162 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 162 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 Consolidated financial statements Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 17.
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 2,565,000 2016: 1,864,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax decrease to net assets of 133,000 2016: 110,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2017 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 2,565 2,565 money market funds 106,747 106,747 2,565 106,747 109,312 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2016 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 1,864 1,864 money market funds 103,557 103,557 1,864 103,557 105,421 The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year 2016: none.
The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price.
Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value.
The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.
The fair values of the groups other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of the following: Held to maturity investment debt securities note 17 comprise bank and building society certificates of deposit, which have fixed coupons.
Fair value for held to maturity assets is based on market bid prices, and hence would be categorised as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
Subordinated loan notes note 26 comprise Tier 2 loan notes.
Fair value of the loan notes is based on discounted future cash flows using current market rates for debts with similar remaining maturity, and hence would be categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
com 163 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Capital management Rathbone Brothers Plc's capital is defined for accounting purposes as total equity.
Rathbone Investment Management has issued 10 year subordinated Tier 2 loan notes note 26.
From time-to-time, the group also runs small overnight overdraft balances as part of working capital.
The groups objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: maintain a strong capital base in a cost-efficient manner to be able to support the development of the business when required: optimise the distribution of capital across group companies, reflecting the requirements of each business: strive to make capital freely transferable across the group where possible: and comply with regulatory requirements at all times.
Rathbones is classified for capital purposes as a banking group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, which is presented to the PRA on an annual basis.
Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with published rules.
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets.
The ICAAP compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the PRAs Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 methodology.
The group has adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar 1 credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk component.
Capital management policy and practices are applied at both group and entity level.
At 31 December 2017 the groups regulatory capital resources, including retained earnings for 2017, were 216,838,000 2016: 174,192,000.
The increase in reserves during 2017 is due an increase in the group's retained earnings on account of profits generated in the year and the gain on remeasurement of the defined benefit liabilities.
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP process, and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are monitored and forecast on a monthly basis to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against adverse business conditions.
No breaches were reported to the PRA during the financial years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017.
33 Contingent liabilities and commitments a Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 31 December 2017 but not provided in the financial statements amounted to 48,000 2016: 4,430,000. b The contractual amounts of the groups commitments to extend credit to its clients are as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Guarantees 117 117 Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less 20,985 25,661 Undrawn commitments to lend of more than 1 year 9,040 5,981 30,142 31,759 The fair value of the guarantees is nil 2016: nil.
164 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 164 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017 Consolidated financial statements c The group leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
At 31 December 2017, the groups agreements to lease space at 8 Finsbury Circus had remaining lease terms of 15 years: total payments due over this period are 75,946,000.
The leases provide for rent reviews every 5 years.

These cash flows have been included in Other financial liabilities in note 31. d The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS to protect depositors and investors from loss in the event of failure of financial institutions has resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years.
The financial impact of unexpected FSCS levies is largely out of the groups control as they result from other industry failures.
There is uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures.
The group contributes to the deposit class, investment fund management class and investment intermediation levy classes and accrues levy costs for future levy years when the obligation arises.
34 Related party transactions Transactions with key management personnel The remuneration of the key management personnel of the group, who are defined as the companys directors and other members of senior management who are responsible for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group, is set out below.
Further information about the remuneration of individual directors is provided in the audited part of the directors' remuneration report on page 95.

As at 31 December 2017, the group had outstanding interest-free season ticket loans of 6,000 2016: 6,000 issued to key management personnel.
At 31 December 2017, key management personnel and their close family members had gross outstanding deposits of 4,059,000 2016: 5,464,000 and gross outstanding banking loans of 728,000 2016: 959,000, all of which 2016: all were made on normal business terms.
A number of the group's key management personnel and their close family members make use of the services provided by companies within the group.
Charges for such services are made at various staff rates.
com 165 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 34 Related party transactions continued Other related party transactions The groups transactions with the pension funds are described in note 27.
At 31 December 2017, no amounts were outstanding with either the Laurence Keen Scheme or the Rathbone 1987 Scheme 2016: nil.
One group subsidiary, Rathbone Unit Trust Management, has authority to manage the investments within a number of unit trusts.
Another group company, Rathbone Investment Management International, acted as investment manager for a protected cell company offering unitised private client portfolio services.
During 2017, the group managed 25 unit trusts, Socits d'Investissement Capital Variable SICAVs and open-ended investment companies OEICs together, 'collectives' 2016: 25 unit trusts and OEICs.
The group charges each fund an annual management fee for these services, but does not earn any performance fees on the unit trusts.
The management charges are calculated on the bases published in the individual fund prospectuses, which also state the terms and conditions of the management contract with the group.
The following transactions and balances relate to the groups interest in the unit trusts: 2017 2016 Year ended 31 December 000 000 Total management fees 35,525 27,783 2017 2016 As at 31 December 000 000 Management fees owed to the group 3,266 2,557 Holdings in unit trusts note 17 2,565 1,864 5,831 4,421 Total management fees are included within 'fee and commission income' in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Management fees owed to the group are included within 'accrued income' and holdings in unit trusts are classified as 'available for sale equity securities' in the consolidated balance sheet.
The maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount on the balance sheet as disclosed above.
All amounts outstanding with related parties are unsecured and will be settled in cash.
No guarantees have been given or received.
No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties.
35 Interest in unconsolidated structured entities As described in note 34, at 31 December 2017, the group owned units in collectives managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management with a value of 2,565,000 2016: 1,864,000, representing 0.05% 2016: 0.05% of the total value of the collectives managed by the group.
These assets are held to hedge the group's exposure to deferred remuneration schemes for employees of Unit Trusts.
The group's primary risk associated with its interest in the unit trusts is from changes in fair value of its holdings in the funds.
The group is not judged to control, and therefore does not consolidate, the collectives.
Although the fund trustees have limited rights to remove Rathbone Unit Trust Management as manager, the group is exposed to very low variability of returns from its management and share of ownership of the funds and is therefore judged to act as an agent rather than having control under IFRS 10.

com 167 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Country-by-country reporting Introduction HM Treasury has transposed the requirements set out under Capital Requirements Directive IV CRD IV and issued the Capital Requirements Country-by-Country Reporting Regulations 2013, effective 1 January 2014.
The legislation requires Rathbone Brothers Plc together with its subsidiaries, the group to publish certain additional information, on a consolidated basis, for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Basis of preparation: Country In most cases, we have determined the country by reference to the country of tax residence.
Where an entity is not subject to tax e. g. a partnership we have considered the location of management or the jurisdiction in which the revenues are generated.
In these cases it is possible that tax is paid in a different country to the one in which profits are reported.
Nature of activities The nature of activities within the United Kingdom are described within our services on page 2 to 5.
Discretionary investment management is the sole activity which occurs in Jersey.
Turnover Turnover is defined as operating income.
As the consolidated results are split by country, there is an element of double counting when inter-jurisdictional transactions for example, the payment of dividends occur.
The entries to eliminate this double counting are included at the bottom of the table to enable the disclosed figures to agree to the published consolidated accounts of the group.
Profit loss before taxation These are accounting profits.
As with turnover some double counting may arise and again this has been eliminated at the bottom of the table.
The majority of the total relates to the elimination of interjurisdictional dividends which are reflected as profits in the United Kingdom.
Tax paid This column reflects corporation tax actually paid in the year.
Note that it is rare that tax paid in any given year relates directly to the profits earned in the same period.
Public subsidies received The group received no public subsidies in the year.
Number of employees The number of employees reported is the average number of full time employees who were permanently employed by the group, or one of its subsidiaries, during the year.
