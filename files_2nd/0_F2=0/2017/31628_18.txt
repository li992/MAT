An intangibles impairment charge of 1.7m related to Euromoney Indices.

The Group recognised a provision for overseas sales tax of 7.9m following an adverse tax ruling in June 2016.
The Group recognised its share of the deficit in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme HPS, a defined benefit scheme, of 1.2m.

In arriving at this rate, the Group removes the tax effect of adjusting items that reconcile statutory to adjusted profit.
However, the current tax effect of goodwill and intangible items is not removed.
The current tax benefit of tax deductible goodwill and intangible items is recognised in the adjusted effective tax rate as the Group considers that this more accurately reflects its expected cash tax payable position as the deferred tax effect on the goodwill and intangible items is not expected to crystallise.
It would only crystallise in the event of a disposal, and that is not expected.
Adjustments in respect of prior years are excluded on the basis that the adjusted tax expense should reflect the tax rate of the Group for the current year after removing exceptional items.
Share of tax on profits of associates and joint ventures is calculated on the adjusted profits of associates and joint ventures and excludes tax on exceptional items consistent with the Groups historical approach and policy.

The other items deductible for tax purposes of 5.1m 2016: 5.3m arise as a result of financing arrangements that result in asymmetrical tax treatment in the territories involved, primarily from debt financing provided to US affiliates.
These items are expected to recur in the short to medium term.
Goodwill and intangibles for the year ended 30 September 2017 are 0.2m.
The 2016 goodwill and intangibles of 2.6m arose as a result of non-deductible goodwill impairment for HFI and Total Derivatives.
There is no impact on 2017 as the goodwill for NDR is deductible.
Adjustments in respect of prior years of 2.3m 2016: 1.0m reflect settlement of open items with tax authorities in 2017 and several small items across numerous jurisdictions that relate to changes in estimates.

11 Discontinued operations and disposal groups classied as held for sale Following the strategic review, a number of businesses met the IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations criteria to be classified as held for sale at 30 September 2017.
These businesses are CEIC and EMIS, Adhesion Group S. A. Adhesion, World Bulk Wine Exhibition, S. L. World Bulk Wine and II Journals.
The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been disclosed separately on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
No impairment of these net assets has been identified at 30 September 2017.
Following the announcement on 7 September 2017 that the Group was to explore strategic options for its Global Markets Intelligence Division CEIC and EMIS after unsolicited interest from potential buyers, the Group has engaged with advisors to assess its options.
CEIC and EMIS meet the IFRS 5 criteria to be treated as discontinued operations due to their size and the fact that the businesses constitute a major line of the Groups business.
CEIC and EMIS are therefore presented as discontinued operations throughout this report and the 2016 Income Statement disclosures have been re-presented separating continuing and discontinued operations.
The other businesses classified as held for sale Adhesion, World Bulk Wine and II Journals, do not meet the IFRS 5 criteria to be treated as discontinued operations.

These assets and liabilities are recorded at the lower of their carrying value and fair values less costs to sell.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, have a finite life and are amortised over their expected useful lives at the rates set out in the accounting policies in note 1 of this report.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGU that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
During the year the goodwill in respect of each of the businesses was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The methodology applied to most CGUs value in use calculations, reflecting past experience and external sources of information, included: budgets by business based on pre-tax cash flows with a CAGR of 3% to 17% for the next three years derived from approved 2017 budgets.
Management believes these budgets to be reasonably achievable: pre-tax discount rates between 12% and 17%, derived from the Companys benchmarked weighted average cost of capital WACC of 10% adjusted for risks specific to the nature of CGUs and risks included within the cash flows themselves: and long-term nominal growth rate of between 1% and 3%.
Following the impairment review, the impairment losses recognised in exceptional items note 5 in respect of goodwill and intangibles are as follows: Goodwill Intangibles Recoverable Discount 2017 impairment impairment amount rate CGU Reportable segment 000 000 000 % NDR Asset management 27,360 46,114 14.2% Goodwill Intangibles Recoverable Discount 2016 impairment impairment amount rate CGU Reportable segment 000 000 000 % Mining Indaba Commodity events 12,941 17,877 15.4% HedgeFund Intelligence Asset management 5,866 4,020 12.0% Total Derivatives Pricing, data & market intelligence 8,180 608 12.0% Euromoney Indices Asset management 1,652 313 12.0% Total 26,987 1,652 22,818 For the year ended 30 September 2017, no impairments were required to the CEIC, EMIS and World Bulk Wine CGUs on a value in use basis before being transferred to held for sale.
Upon classification as held for sale the CGUs were assessed by reference to expected sale proceeds and no impairments were required.
Further disclosures in accordance with IAS 36 are provided where the Group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a CGU that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15% or more of the Groups total carrying value of goodwill.
The only significant item of goodwill of 172.6m 2016: 177.7m relates to BCA.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 111 25610 11 December 2017 11:43 AM Proof 5 Euromoney AR2017 Financials-Proof 6. indd 111 12 11 2017 11:57:31 AM Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 12 Goodwill and other intangibles assets continued The remaining carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets consists of a number of CGUs, none of which are individually significant to the Group.
The aggregate value of goodwill for these CGUs is 227.4m 2016: 218.4m.
For BCA, using the above methodology, a pre-tax discount rate of 13.6% 2016: 13.7% and long-term nominal growth rate of 1.7% 2016: 2%, the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by 130.0m 2016: 175.8m.
The Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of this CGU.
For the recoverable amount to fall to the carrying value, the discount rate would need to be increased by seven percentage points 2016: 10 percentage points or the long-term growth rate reduced by 10 percentage points 2016: 16 percentage points.
For the other CGUs, IAS 36 provides that, if there is any reasonably possible change to a key assumption that would cause the CGUs carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount, further disclosures are required.
For NDR, when using the above methodology and a pre-tax discount rate of 14.2% 2016: 14.4% and long-term nominal growth rate of 1.7% 2016: 2%, the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by 2.0m 2016: 15.7m.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for NDR, the following changes in assumptions in isolation, would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value: the discount rate increased by one percentage point 2016: three percentage points : the long-term growth rate reduced by one percentage point 2016: five percentage points.
The headroom has reduced due to the pressure of market conditions resulting in the impairment of NDRs goodwill in 2017 and therefore any significant decrease in the pre-tax cash flows would result in further impairment.
NDR is a global provider of independent research solutions to the worlds leading financial institutions.

These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The average age of these receivables is 66 days 2016: 73 days.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Ageing of trade receivables impaired and partially provided for: 2017 2016 000 000 Past due less than a month 1,557 998 Past due more than a month but less than two months 1,929 917 Past due more than two months but less than three months 1,472 883 Past due more than three months 4,107 3,882 9,065 6,680 The amount of the provision for impaired trade receivables was 3.7m 2016: 5.3m.
It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered.
Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 At 1 October 5,270 5,441 Impairment losses recognised 5,074 4,089 Impairment losses reversed 3,941 3,493 Amounts written off as uncollectible 1,220 1,047 Disposals 99 Exchange differences 62 377 Classified as held for sale 1,433 2 At 30 September 3,688 5,270 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts does not include individually impaired trade receivables which have been placed under liquidation as these trade receivables are written off directly to the Income Statement.

Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Full details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial risk management are set out in this note and on page 95 of the accounting policies.
The Groups Tax and Treasury Committee is responsible for recommending policy to the Board.
The Groups treasury policies are directed to giving greater certainty of future costs and revenues and ensuring that the Group has adequate liquidity for working capital and debt capacity for funding acquisitions.
The treasury department does not act as a profit centre, nor does it undertake any speculative trading activity and it operates within policies and procedures approved by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings.
Further details are set out in the interest rate risk section page 123.
Forward contracts are used to manage the Groups exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements on foreign currency transactions.
Further details are set out in the foreign exchange rate risk section page 122.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2016.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 120 25610 11 December 2017 11:43 AM Proof 5 Euromoney AR2017 Financials-Proof 6. indd 120 12 11 2017 11:57:32 AM Financial statements 19 Financial instruments and risk management continued Net cash debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio The Groups Tax and Treasury Committee reviews the Groups capital structure at least twice a year.
Committed bank facilities available to the Group until December 2021 contain covenants based on a maximum 3.0 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and a minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times.
The amounts and foreign exchange rates used in the covenant calculations are subject to adjustments as defined under the terms of the arrangement.
Management regularly monitors the covenants and prepares detailed cash flow forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not close or potentially close to breach.
Additionally, the Group arranges its currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in that particular currency to total Group earnings.
The bank covenant ratio uses an average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt.
The resultant net debt cash to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.24 times 2016 0.74 times.
Using a closing rate basis for the valuation of net debt cash, the ratio was 1.23 times 2016 0.74 times.
Categories of financial instruments The Groups financial assets and liabilities at 30 September are as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Financial assets Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 3,110 419 Derivative instruments recognised at fair value through profit and loss 238 Available-for-sale investments note 14 3,546 5,835 Convertible loan note fair value through profit and loss 2,503 Deferred consideration note 25 loans and receivables 1,989 526 Loans and receivables including cash at bank and short-term deposits 59,299 147,478 Classified as held for sale loans and receivables including cash at bank and short-term deposits 18,987 680 89,672 154,938 Financial liabilities Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 1,231 10,449 Deferred consideration note 25 borrowings and payables 350 480 Acquisition commitments note 25 fair value through profit and loss 286 Acquisition commitments note 25 borrowings and payables 12,839 11,771 Borrowings and payables including bank overdrafts 264,782 97,659 Classified as held for sale borrowings and payables including bank overdrafts 10,002 1,000 289,490 121,359 Derivative instruments are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy and acquisition commitments held at fair value through the profit and loss are classified as level 3.
Available-for-sale investments are held at cost less any identified impairments as they do not have a quoted market price in an active market and the fair value cannot be reliably measured.
No other financial assets or liabilities are held at fair value.
The Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair value.
The Group has derivative assets of 3.3m 2016: 0.4m and derivative liabilities of 1.2m 2016: 10.4m with a number of banks that do not meet the offsetting criteria of IAS 32, but which the Group has the right to set-off same currency cash flows settled on the same date.
Consequently, the gross amount of the derivative assets and the gross amount of the derivative liabilities are presented separately in the Groups Statement of Financial Position.
The convertible loan note is a fair value through profit and loss financial asset held at cost as it contains an embedded derivative of non-quoted equity for which the Group is unable to accurately determine a fair value.
The acquisition commitments for Reinsurance Security Consultancy.
co. uk Limited is consideration contingent on the future profit and revenue of the business and are therefore re-measured at fair value through the profit and loss note 25.
The Group has entered into an omnibus guarantee and setoff agreement with Lloyds Banking Group plc with a right to setoff outstanding credit balances against cash balances.
Cash and cash equivalents included gross overdrafts of 0.2m 2016: nil which are offset under the cash pooling arrangements.
This agreement meets the offsetting criteria of IAS 32. i Market price risk Market price risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of the Groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The Groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by the Group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts are set out in this note and represent the value for which an asset could be sold or liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction calculated using the market rates of interest and exchange at 30 September 2017.
The Group has no other material market price risks.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks during the year.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 121 25610 11 December 2017 11:43 AM Proof 5 Euromoney AR2017 Financials-Proof 6. indd 121 12 11 2017 11:57:32 AM Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 19 Financial instruments and risk management continued ii Foreign exchange rate risk The Groups principal foreign exchange exposure is to the US dollar.
The Group generates approximately two-thirds of its revenues in US dollars, including approximately 40% of the revenues in its UK-based businesses, and approximately 80% of its operating profits are US dollar-denominated.
The Group is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk on the US dollar revenues in its UK businesses, the translation of results of foreign subsidiaries and external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower.
The Group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries.
Fluctuations in the value of sterling versus foreign currencies could materially affect the amount of these items in the consolidated financial statements, even if their values have not changed in their original currency.
The Group does endeavour to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The carrying amounts of the Groups US dollar-denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 000 000 US dollar 62,742 55,910 319,446 347,444 Subsidiaries normally do not hedge transactions in foreign currencies into the functional currency of their own operations.
However, at a group level, a series of US dollar and euro forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars and euros so as to hedge 80% of the Groups UK based US dollar and euro revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% of the Groups UK based US dollar and euro revenues for the subsequent six months.
The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on managements estimate of its future US dollar and euro revenues over an 18 month period and is regularly reviewed and revised with any changes in estimates resulting in either additional forward contracts being taken out or existing contracts maturity dates being moved forward or back.
If management materially underestimate the Groups future US dollar and euro denominated revenues, this would lead to too few forward contracts being in place and the Group being more exposed to swings in US dollar and euro to sterling exchange rates.
An overestimate of the Groups US dollar and euro denominated revenues would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess forward contracts.
The Group also has a significant operation in Canada whose revenues are mainly in US dollars.
At a group level a series of forward contracts are put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the operations Canadian dollar cost base.
In addition, each subsidiary is encouraged to invoice sales in its local functional currency where possible.
Forward exchange contracts are gross settled at maturity.
Impact of 10% strengthening of sterling against US dollar The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against US dollar.
A 10% sensitivity has been determined by the Board as the sensitivity rate appropriate when reporting an estimated foreign currency risk internally and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates at the reporting date.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower.
Where sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency a negative number below indicates a decrease in profit and equity.
For a 10% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other comprehensive income, and the balances below would be positive.
2017 2016 000 000 Change in profit for the year in Income Statement US$ net assets in UK companies 838 79 Change in other comprehensive income derivative financial instruments 6,545 6,811 Change in other comprehensive income loans to from foreign operations 17,751 29,139 The increase in the loss from the sensitivity analysis is due to an increase in the working capital assets.
The decrease in other comprehensive income from 6.8m to 6.5m from the sensitivity analysis is due to the decrease in the notional value of the derivative financial instruments.
The change in other comprehensive income from a 10% change in sterling against US dollars in relation to the translation of loans to from foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower would result in a change of 17.8m 2016: 29.1m.
However, the change in other comprehensive income is completely offset by the change in value of the foreign operations net assets from their translation into sterling.
The Group is also exposed to the translation of the results of its US dollar-denominated businesses, although the Group does not hedge the translation of these results.
Consequently, fluctuations in the value of sterling versus other currencies could materially affect the translation of these results in the consolidated financial statements.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 122 25610 11 December 2017 11:43 AM Proof 5 Euromoney AR2017 Financials-Proof 6. indd 122 12 11 2017 11:57:32 AM Financial statements 19 Financial instruments and risk management continued Forward foreign exchange contracts It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts.
A series of US dollar and euro forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars and euros so as to hedge 80% of the Groups UK-based US dollar and euro revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% for the subsequent six months.
In addition, at a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the subsidiarys Canadian cost base.
In the past, the Group had also entered into a number of short-dated South African Rand forward contracts to hedge future UK-based ZAR payments.
As at 30 September 2017, the aggregate amount of unrealised gains under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future revenue transactions is 1.8m 2016: 10.0m loss.
It is anticipated that the transactions will take place over the next 18 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released to the Income Statement.
As at 30 September 2017, there were no ineffective cash flow hedges in place 2016: nil.
iii Interest rate risk The Groups borrowings are in both sterling and US dollars with the related interest tied to LIBOR.
This results in the Groups interest charge being at risk to fluctuations in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy to hedge approximately 80% of its term loan interest exposure, converting its floating rate debt into fixed debt by means of interest rate swaps.
The predictability of interest costs is deemed to be more important than the possible opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower interest rates.
The Group has interest rate swap protection on principal amounts of US$80.0m and 32.0m to swap outstanding borrowings from floating to fixed rates at rates of 1.972% and 0.760% respectively until December 2021.
As at 30 September 2017, the aggregate amount of unrealised gains on interest rate swaps deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future interest cash flows is 0.1m 2016: nil.
It is anticipated that the future interest cash flows will take place over the next 4-5 years at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released to the Income Statement.
No ineffectiveness was recognised in the Income Statement 2016: nil.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section on page 124.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 123 25610 11 December 2017 11:43 AM Proof 5 Euromoney AR2017 Financials-Proof 6. indd 123 12 11 2017 11:57:32 AM Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 19 Financial instruments and risk management continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate instruments, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents the Directors assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates at the reporting date.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 30 September 2017 would decrease or increase by 0.8m 2016: 0.8m.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fair value equity reserves would decrease or increase by 3.4m mainly as a result of the changes in fair value of interest rate swaps.
iv Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign currency risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result have a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the amounts outstanding with, and the credit quality of, these counterparties.
For the Groups cash and cash equivalents these are principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings.
Treasury policies in place do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated below investment grade.
The Group also has credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the Groups large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk of non-payment taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the Statement of Financial Position.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
v Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due.
To manage this risk the Group has readily accessible funding arrangements in place and seeks to optimise Group liquidity through cash pooling arrangements.
The Groups principal source of borrowings are provided through committed bank facilities available to the Group until December 2021.
These syndicated facilities include a 130m multi-currency revolving credit facility which was drawn down by 55.2m at 30 September 2017.
In 2016, the Group had access to a committed multi-currency credit facility from DMGT.
This facility was terminated in December 2016 as part of the share buyback transaction along with a deposit agreement for placing excess operating funds on deposit with DMGT.
The Groups strategy is to use excess operating cash to pay down its drawings under the revolving credit facility.
The Group generally has an annual cash conversion rate the percentage by which cash generated from operations covers adjusted operating profit before acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items of 100% or more due to much of its subscription, sponsorship and delegate revenue being paid in advance.
The Groups operating cash conversion rate based on adjusted operating profit was 110%.
The Groups forecasts and projections, looking out to September 2022 and taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level and covenants of its current and available borrowing facilities.

Level 2 The fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curve derived from quoted interest rates.
Level 3 If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market date, the instrument is included in level 3.
As at 30 September 2017 and the prior year, all the resulting fair value estimates have been included in level 2 other than the Groups contingent considerations which are classified as level 3.
Other financial instruments not recorded at fair value The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values.
Such financial assets and financial liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and loans.

These syndicated facilities include two five-year term-loans of US$100m and 40m total 114.6m and a 130m multi-currency revolving credit facility which was drawn down by 55.2m at 30 September 2017.
There is a further accordion facility of 130m should the Group wish to request it.
The term-loans and drawings under the revolving credit facility bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a margin, the applicable margin being based on the Groups ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA.
These facilities contain covenants based on a maximum 3.0 times adjusted net debt to EBITDA and a minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times.
On this basis, at 30 September 2017, the Groups adjusted net debt to EBITDA was 1.24 times.
This facility was terminated in December 2016 as part of the share buyback transaction.

Other provisions The provision consists of social security costs arising on share option liabilities and dilapidations on leasehold properties.
A dilapidation provision of 2.1m 2016: 2.1m is held in respect of the Groups main London offices.
The leases, which expire in 2029, do not contain any break clauses.
As such, it is unlikely that the provisions will be utilised before the expiry date of the leases.

There is a deferred tax liability in relation to remitted earnings of 1.1m 2016: nil that is expected to reverse in the short-term.
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused US tax losses available for offset against future profits.
At 30 September the deferred tax asset recognised in relation to these losses is analysed as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 UK 1,899 3,248 US 2,248 2,056 Europe 1,489 5,636 5,304 The Directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading it is probable that the level of profits in future years is sufficient to enable the above assets to be recovered.
The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date they arose and have expiry dates between 2017 and 2037.
There is no expiry date on the other losses.
The movement in net deferred tax liabilities since last year-end is largely attributable to the acquisition of RISI note 15 partly offset by the impact of the NDR goodwill impairment note 5.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 300.0m 2016: 266.0m relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 30 September 2017 represent the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

The total charge recognised in the year from equity-settled options was 1.1m, representing 100% of the Groups longterm incentive charge partly offset by the credit for cash-settled options 2016: 0.7m, 62%.
There were no share options exercisable at 30 September 2017 2016: nil.
Cash-settled options The Group has liabilities in respect of two share option schemes that are classified by IFRS 2 Share-based Payments as cashsettled.
These consist of the cash element of the CAP 2010 and the CAP 2014 scheme.
Share Option Schemes The Company has four share option schemes for which an IFRS 2 Share-based Payments charge has been recognised.
Details of these schemes are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 73.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are shown below.

Participants save a fixed monthly amount of up to 500 for three years and are then able to buy shares in the Company at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
In line with market practice, no performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.
The SAYE options were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a period of three years.
The expected term of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The CAP 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 21 January 2010.
Each CAP 2010 award comprises two equal elements: an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each in the Company at an exercise price of 0.25 pence per ordinary share, and a right to receive a cash payment.
The award pool comprised 3,500,992 ordinary shares with an option value of 15.0m and cash of 15.0m, limiting the total accounting cost to 30.0m over its life.
The awards vest in two equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards became exercisable in February 2013 on satisfaction of the primary performance condition in 2012 and there are no options outstanding.
The second tranche became exercisable in February 2014 in which the primary performance condition was again satisfied.
The remaining balance of the second tranche is subject to an additional performance condition, applicable for the vesting of the second tranche of awards, which requires the profits of each business in the subsequent vesting period be at least 75% of that achieved in the year the first tranche of awards became exercisable.
The options lapse to the extent unexercised by 30 September 2020.
The remaining CAP 2010 share options are unlikely to vest and the charge has been released in 2017.
The CAP 2014 was approved by shareholders on 30 January 2014 as a replacement for CAP 2010.
Each CAP 2014 award comprises two equal instalments: an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each in the Company for nil consideration, and a right to receive a cash payment.
The value of the awards is linked directly to the growth in profits over the performance period.
The award pool comprises a maximum of 3.5m shares and cash of 7.6m, limiting the cost of the scheme to 41.0m over its life.
Awards will vest in three equal tranches, subject to the performance conditions, and lapse to the extent unexercised by 30 September 2023.
The minimum performance target under CAP 2014 was not achieved and the options have lapsed in 2017.
No costs were amortised in 2017 2016: nil.
Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP was approved by shareholders on 1 June 2015.
Under the PSP, each award of nil-cost options has a maximum life of 10 years.
The maximum award is shares with a market value of 200% of annualised basic salary.
These awards will not normally vest until the respective three or five years after the award and provided the performance conditions have been met.
For the year ended 30 September 2017, two grants which have either a three or five-year vesting periods were made under the PSP in the form of nil-cost options.
A share award was made to A Rashbass of 141,857 and CR Jones of 25,562.
The actual number of award shares which vest will depend on the extent to which performance conditions have been satisfied over a five-year period ending on 30 September 2021.
The other share award was made to Divisional Directors totalling 157,809 award shares whereby vesting will depend on the extent to which performance conditions have been satisfied over a three-year period ending on 30 September 2019.
For the year ended 30 September 2016, the only grant under this scheme was to A Rashbass for 159,269 share awards with a fair value of 1.5m.
The share price used to determine the number of shares awarded under the PSP grants is the average of the middle market quotations of an Ordinary Share as derived from the Daily Official List for the five dealing days preceding the date of grant.
Further details are shown in the Directors Remuneration Report.

The Directors derive their estimates from internal business plans and financial due diligence.
At 30 September 2017, the weighted average growth rates used in estimating the expected profits range was 5%.
A one percentage point increase or decrease in growth rate in estimating the expected profits results in the acquisition commitment at 30 September 2017 increasing or decreasing by 0.2m with the corresponding change to the value charged or credited to the Income Statement in future periods.

The total net pension costs from continuing operations of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2017 were 3.1m 2016: 3.1m.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates the following defined contribution schemes: DMGT PensionSaver, Euromoney PensionSaver and the Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan in the UK and 401 k savings and investment plan in the US.
In compliance with the Pension Act 2008, the Group operated a defined contribution plan, DMGT PensionSaver, up to 30 June 2017 and thereafter the Euromoney PensionSaver, into which relevant employees are automatically enrolled.
The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes for the year ended 30 September comprised: Restated 2017 2016 000 000 DMGT and Euromoney PensionSaver 2,048 2,059 Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan 14 15 Private schemes 966 889 Harmsworth Pension Scheme 11 3,028 2,974 DMGT and Euromoney PensionSaver Both schemes operate as group personal pension plan under the same terms.
The Euromoney PensionSaver is the principal pension arrangement offered to employees of the Group.
Employees are able to contribute a minimum of 2% of salary with an equal company contribution in the first three years of employment and thereafter at twice the employee contribution rate, up to a maximum employer contribution of 10% of salary.
Assets are invested in funds selected by members and held independently from the Companys finances.
The investment and administration is undertaken by Fidelity Pension Management.
Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan The Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The scheme is closed to new members.
The plans assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently from the Companys finances.
The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Skandia Life Group.
Private schemes Institutional Investor LLC contributes to a 401 k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 50% of salary maximum of US$52,000 a year with the Company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 6% of salary.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme MBPS and participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme HPS, which is a scheme operated by DMGT, both of which are now closed to new entrants.
In 2016, due to a change in DMGTs policy to allocate the assets and liabilities of DMGT groups defined benefit plan on a buy-out basis, the Groups share of HPSs liability was recognised at 30 September 2016, which was treated as an exceptional item as shown in note 5.
Harmsworth Pension Scheme HPS is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme operated by DMGT and closed to further accrual.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out triennially by the scheme actuary.
Prior to its closure to future accrual on 1 January 2016, DMGT made annual contributions of 12% or 18% of members basic pay depending on membership section to HPS.
Following the results of the latest triennial valuation as at 31 March 2016, DMGT agreed a Recovery Plan involving annual funding payments of 13.0m on 5 October 2016 to 2018, 16.2m on 5 October 2019 to 2025 and 76.2m on 5 October 2026.
DMGT considers that these contribution rates are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period.
This Recovery Plan will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation due to be completed with an effective date of 31 March 2019.
In February 2014 DMGT agreed with the Trustees, that should it continue its share buy-back programme, it would make additional contributions to its schemes amounting to 20% of the value of shares purchased.
No contributions relating to this agreement were made in the year to 30 September 2017.
DMGT enabled the Trustees of HPS scheme to acquire a beneficial interest in a Limited Partnership investment vehicle LP.
The LP has been designed to facilitate payment of 10.8m as part of the deficit funding payments described above over the period to 2026.
In addition, the LP is required to make a final payment to the scheme of 149.9m, or the funding deficit within the scheme on an ongoing actuarial valuation basis at the end of the period to 2026 if this is less.
For funding purposes, HPSs interest in the LP is treated as an asset of the scheme and reduces the actuarial deficit within the scheme.
However, under IAS 19 Employee Benefits the LP is not included as an asset of the scheme and therefore is not included in the disclosures below.
DMGT also has a defined benefit obligation relating to the DMGT AVC Plan the Plan which is closed to further member contributions.
Following the results of the most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan, carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017, the Trustees and DMGT have agreed that no further contributions are required from DMGT.

The Euromoney Group did not contribute to the scheme in 2017 and expects to contribute 0.1m in 2018.
Northcliffe Trustees Limited the Trustee has been appointed by DMGT as an independent trustee to administer and manage the HPS on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the HPS Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation principally the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act 2004.
Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme A full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme is carried out triennially by the Scheme Actuary.
The latest valuation of the MBPS was completed as at 1 June 2016.
As a result of the 2016 valuation, the Company agreed to make annual contributions of 38.9% per annum of pensionable salaries, plus 55,900 per month to the scheme over the period to 2022.
The Group considers that the contributions set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 0.7m to the MBPS during the year to 30 September 2018.
Pension Legacy Trustees Limited the Trustee has been appointed by Euromoney Global Limited as an independent trustee to administer and manage the MBPS on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the MBPS Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation principally the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act 2004.
The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a company can recognise a pension surplus on its Statement of Financial Position.
Having taken account of the rules of the schemes, the Group considers that recognition of surpluses in the schemes on its Statement of Financial Position would be in accordance with the interpretation of IFRIC 14.

All the assets listed, above excluding property and cash and cash equivalents, have a quoted market price in an active market.
The assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The actual return on plan assets was 4.0m 2016: 4.8m.
The key financial assumptions adopted are as follows: MBPS HPS 2017 2016 2017 2016 % % % % Discount rate 2.55 2.40 2.60 2.40 Price inflation 3.10 2.95 3.20 2.95 Salary increases 2.50 2.50 2.50 2.50 Pension increases 3.00 2.80 3.00 2.80 The discount rate for both scheme liabilities and the fair value of scheme assets reflects yields at the year-end date on high-quality corporate bonds and are based on a cash flow-based yield curve, calculating a single equivalent discount rate reflecting the average duration of the schemes liabilities, rounded to the nearest 0.05% p. a.
At 30 September 2016 this methodology incorporated bonds given an AA rating from at least one of the main four rating agencies Standard & Poors, Moodys, Fitch and DBRS.
At 30 September 2017 the methodology reverted back to incorporated bonds given an AA rating from at least two of the four main rating agencies, as used in years prior to 30 September 2016.
The impact of this change in accounting estimate is to increase the defined benefit obligation and net pension obligation reported on the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 September 2017 by 1.8m.
RPI inflation is derived in a similar way to the discount rate but with reference to the Bank of England spot curve at the duration of the schemes weighted average duration with an appropriate allowance for inflation risk premium MBPS: 0.30% p. a. HPS: 0.20% p. a..
The nominal and real spot curves provided by the Bank of England were extrapolated up to 50 years using a bootstrapping method which uses gilt price information provided by the UK Debt Management Office.
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI projections but with a long-term rate of improvement in future mortality rates of 1.25% p. a. Allowance is made for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 136 25610 11 December 2017 11:43 AM Proof 5 Euromoney AR2017 Financials-Proof 6. indd 136 12 11 2017 11:57:34 AM Financial statements 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year is approximately 16 years for MBPS 2016: 20 years and 20 years for HPS 2016: 20 years.
MBPS HPS 2017 2016 2017 2016 1 Assumed life expectancy in years, on retirement Retiring at the end of the reporting year: Males 26.9 24.6 26.4 24.6 Females 29.0 26.8 28.3 26.8 Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year: Males 28.8 26.4 26.8 26.4 Females 31.0 28.7 29.2 28.7 1 MBPS 62 years: HPS 60 years Pension costs and the size of any pension surplus or deficit are sensitive to the assumptions adopted.
The sensitivity of the defined obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Change in Change in Assumption assumption liabilities Discount rate Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 0.9% Inflation rate Increase by 0.1% Increase by 0.8% Salary increases Increase by 0.25% Increase by 0.7% Life expectancy Increase by one year Increase by 3.4% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions has been estimated by projecting the results of the last full actuarial valuation as at 1 June 2016 forward to 30 September 2019.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.
These are the significant risks in connection with running defined benefit schemes, and the key risks are detailed below: Discount rate risk The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high-quality corporate bond yields.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of corporate bonds held by the schemes.
Inflation rate risk A significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore increased inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation.
The Trustees have sought to acquire certain assets with exposure to inflationary uplifts in order to negate a proportion of this risk.
Life expectancy risk The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated with reference to the best estimate of the mortality of scheme members.
An increase in assumed life expectancy will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation.
Regular reviews of mortality experience are performed to ensure life expectancy assumptions remain appropriate.
Investment risk This is a measure of the uncertainty that the return on the schemes assets keeps pace with the discount rate.
The schemes hold a significant proportion of equities and similar growth assets, which are expected to outperform the discount rate in the long term.
28 Contingent liabilities Claims in Malaysia Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against the Company and three of its employees in respect of an article published in one of the Companys magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November 1995.
The writs were served on the Company on 22 October 1996.
Two of these writs have been discontinued.
The total outstanding amount claimed on the two remaining writs is Malaysian ringgit 83.1m 14.7m.
No provision has been made for these claims in these financial statements as the Directors do not believe the Company has any material liability in respect of these writs.
