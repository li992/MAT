The carrying amount of goodwill acquired through business combinations is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Dry cargo chartering 12.0 12.0 Container chartering 1.8 1.8 Tankers chartering 11.3 11.8 Specialised products chartering 12.2 12.2 Gas chartering 2.7 2.7 Sale and purchase broking 48.9 50.7 Offshore broking 79.8 81.8 Securities 110.6 115.0 Port and agency services 2.9 2.9 Research services 3.3 3.3 285.5 294.2 The movement in the aggregate carrying value is analysed in more detail in note 12.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs which are tested for impairment at least annually.
The goodwill arising in each CGU is similar in nature and thus the testing for impairment uses the same approach.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are assessed using a value-in-use model.
Value-in-use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows: the pre-tax discount rate for the chartering and broking CGUs is 8.7% 2016: 8.9%, port and agency services is 8.7% 2016: 8.9%, research services is 8.7% 2016: 8.9% and for securities is 8.5% 2016: 9.2%.
As all broking and chartering CGUs have operations that are global in nature and similar risk profiles, the same discount rate has been used: these discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC and adjusted for CGU-specific risk factors.
The Groups WACC is a function of the Groups cost of equity, derived using a Capital Asset Pricing Model.
The cost of equity includes a number of variables to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated: and the cash flow predictions are based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by the Board, extrapolated over a five year period.
These are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development and take into account the cyclicality of the business in which the CGU operates.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated in perpetuity using a conservative growth rate of 1.7% 2016: 1.7% across all CGUs.
The results of the Directors review of goodwill, including sensitivity analyses for reasonable changes in assumptions, still indicate remaining headroom.
Accordingly, no reasonably possible change is foreseen which gives rise to an impairment of goodwill.
In light of global macro-economic and geo-political uncertainty, the Board keeps the carrying value of goodwill under constant review.
In the event that any of the markets in which we operate has a sustained downturn, an impairment of the relevant CGUs goodwill may be required.

There was no expense in 2017 as a result of these awards.
The fair value of the above shares was determined based on the market price at the date of grant.
As part of previous acquisitions, certain elements of consideration are payable in the form of shares in Clarkson PLC.
Where these are contingent on the employees remaining in service, the cost of these shares are charged to the consolidated income statement over the service period.

22 Employee benefits The Groups three defined benefit pension schemes are in the UK and all financial information provided in this note relates to the sum of the three separate schemes.
The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes, being the Clarkson PLC scheme, the Plowrights scheme and the Stewarts scheme, which are funded by the payment of contributions to separate trusts administered by Trustees who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The schemes assets are invested in a range of pooled pension investment funds managed by professional fund managers.
Defined benefit pension arrangements give rise to open ended commitments and liabilities for the sponsoring company.
As a consequence, the Company closed its original defined benefit section of the Clarkson PLC scheme to new entrants on 31 March 2004.
This section was closed to further accrual for all existing members as from 31 March 2006.
The Plowrights scheme was closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
The Stewarts scheme was closed to further accrual on 1 January 2004.
Every three years, a pension scheme must obtain from an actuary a report containing a valuation and a recommendation on rates of contribution.
Triennial valuations for all the schemes have been prepared.
The valuation of the Clarkson PLC scheme showed a pension surplus of 3.6m as at 31 March 2016.
Clarkson PLC and the Trustees agreed to cease funding with effect from 1 October 2016.
The valuation of the Plowrights scheme showed a pension deficit of 1.2m as at 31 March 2016.
Clarkson PLC and the Trustees agreed to continue the funding plan, at the rate of 0.9m per annum, until 30 September 2017.
The valuation of the Stewarts scheme showed a pension deficit of 2.1m as at 1 September 2015.
Clarksons Platou Offshore Limited have agreed with the Trustees to pay contributions to remove the deficit over a period of seven years from 1 September 2015 at the rate of 0.4m per annum until 31 October 2016 and 0.3m per annum thereafter.
The Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
All schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
com 119 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Employee benefits continued Other pension arrangements Overseas defined contribution arrangements have been determined in accordance with local practice and regulations.
The Group also operates various other defined contribution pension arrangements.
Where required, the Group also makes contributions into these schemes.
The Group incurs no material expenses in the provision of post-retirement benefits other than pensions.
The following tables summarise amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the components of net benefit charge recognised in the consolidated income statement: Recognised in the balance sheet 2017 2016 m m Fair value of schemes assets 202.7 200.5 Present value of funded defined benefit obligations 185.1 194.1 17.6 6.4 Effect of asset ceiling minimum funding commitment in relation to the Plowrights scheme 5.3 4.1 Net benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 12.3 2.3 The net benefit asset disclosed above is the combined total of the three schemes.
The Clarkson PLC scheme has a surplus of 16.7m 2016: 7.5m, the Plowrights scheme has a deficit of nil 2016: 0.6m and the Stewarts scheme has a deficit of 4.4m 2016: 4.6m.
As there is no right of set-off between the schemes, the benefit asset of 16.7m 2016: 7.5m is disclosed separately on the balance sheet from the benefit liability of 4.4m 2016: 5.2m.
The surplus in the Clarkson PLC scheme is recognised, as there are future economic benefits available in the form of a reduction in future contributions to the defined contribution section of the scheme.
There are no such future economic benefits in respect of the Plowright Scheme and therefore the surplus of 5.3m 2016: 3.5m cannot be recognised.
In addition, a minimum funding commitment of nil 2016: 0.6 m was recognised as arising from agreed future contributions to the Plowright Scheme.
This is in accordance with the respective Trust Deed and Rules.
A deferred tax asset on the benefit liability amounting to 0.8m 2016: 0.8m and a deferred tax liability on the benefit asset of 2.8m 2016: 1.2m is shown in note 7.

com 121 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Employee benefits continued The principal valuation assumptions are as follows: 2017 2016 % % Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 7.0 3.2 7.0 Price inflation RPI 3.2 3.3 Price inflation CPI 2.2 2.3 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.5 2.7 The mortality assumptions used to assess the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 and 2016 is based on the SAPS Light SAPS for the Stewart scheme standard mortality tables published by the actuarial profession in 2014.
These tables have been adjusted to allow for anticipated future improvements in life expectancy using the standard projection model published in 2016 31 December 2016: model published in 2015.
Examples of the assumed future life expectancy are given in the table below: Additional years 2017 2016 Post-retirement life expectancy on retirement at age 65: Pensioners retiring in the year male 22.0 to 23.1 22.0 to 23.1 female 24.0 to 24.2 24.0 to 24.3 Pensioners retiring in 20 years time male 23.5 to 24.5 23.5 to 24.5 female 25.5 to 25.7 25.6 to 25.8 Experience adjustments 2017 2016 m m Experience gain on schemes assets 9.8 29.8 Gain on schemes liabilities due to changes in demographic assumptions 0.3 14.1 Gain loss on schemes liabilities due to changes in financial assumptions 0.1 40.6 Experience gains on schemes liabilities 3.9 Loss on asset ceiling minimum funding commitment 1.1 2.6 Total actuarial gain 9.1 4.6 Sensitivities The table below shows the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions.
The impact of changes to each assumption is shown in isolation although, in practice, changes to assumptions may occur at the same time and can either offset or compound the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation.
A change of 0.25% is deemed appropriate given the movement in assumptions in the year.
The sensitivities have been calculated using the same methodology as the main calculations.
The weighted average duration of the defined obligation is 17 years.
Change in Change in defined assumption benefit obligation Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.25% -4.0% -0.25% 4.3% Price inflation RPI 0.25% 3.4% -0.25% -3.2% An increase of one year in the assumed life expectancy for both males and females would increase the benefit obligation by 3.9% 2016: 3.9%.

com 123 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group has entered into commercial leases in relation to land and buildings and other assets on the basis that it is not in the Groups best interests to purchase these assets.
The leases expire within one and 11 years and have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Renewals are at the option of the specific entity that holds the lease.
There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Within one year 11.6 9.1 After one year but not more than five years 37.1 39.4 After five years 44.9 53.4 93.6 101.9 The Group has sublet space in certain properties.

Contingencies The Group has given no financial commitments to suppliers 2016: none.
The Group has given no guarantees 2016: none.
From time to time, the Group is engaged in litigation in the ordinary course of business.
The Group carries professional indemnity insurance.
There is currently no litigation that is expected to have a material adverse financial impact on the Groups consolidated results or net assets.
The Group also maintained throughout the financial year directors and officers liability insurance in respect of its Directors.
26 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and accruals.
The Groups principal financial assets are trade receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has not entered into derivative transactions other than the forward currency contracts explained later in this section.
It is, and has been throughout 2017 and 2016, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken for speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below.
Credit risk The Group seeks to trade only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and any potential bad debts identified at an early stage.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amounts as disclosed in note 14: based on experience and ongoing market information about the creditworthiness of counterparties, we reasonably expect to collect all amounts unimpaired.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
With respect to credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents and deposits held as current investments, the financial institutions used are closely monitored by the Group treasury function to ensure they are held with creditworthy institutions and to ensure there is no over-exposure to any one institution.
For all financial assets held, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

The Groups revenue is mainly denominated in US dollars and the majority of expenses are denominated in local currencies.
The Group also has balance sheet exposures, either at the local entity level where monetary assets and liabilities are held in currencies other than the functional currency, and at a Group level on the retranslation of non-sterling balances into the Groups functional currency.
Our aim is to manage this risk by reducing the impact of any fluctuations.
The Group hedges currency exposure through forward sales of US dollar revenues.
We also sell US dollars on the spot market to meet local currency expenditure requirements.
We also continually assess rates of exchange, non-sterling balances and asset exposures by currency.
The Group is most sensitive to changes in the US dollar and Norwegian krone exchange rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before taxation and equity.

com 125 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Derivative financial instruments It is the Groups policy to cover or hedge a proportion of its transactional US dollar exposures with foreign currency contracts.
Where these are designated and documented as hedging instruments in the context of IAS 39 and are demonstrated to be effective, mark-to-market gains and losses are recognised directly in equity see note 24 and transferred to the income statement upon receipt of cash and conversion to sterling of the underlying item being hedged.

Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
These financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis and the Group continues to pay dividends.
A number of the Groups trading entities are subject to regulation by the Norwegian FSA, the FCA in the UK, the MAS in Singapore and the NFA, SEC and FINRA in the US.
Regulatory capital at entity level depends on the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated.
In each case, the approach is to hold an appropriate surplus over the local minimum requirement.
Each regulated entity complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
27 Financial instruments Fair values IFRS 13 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
