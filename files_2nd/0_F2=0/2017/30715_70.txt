GSK and Novartis have contributed their respective Consumer Healthcare businesses into a Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture in a non-cash transaction.
GSK has an equity interest of 63.5% and majority control of the Joint Venture.
In addition, GSK has acquired Novartis global Vaccines business excluding influenza vaccines for an initial cash consideration of $5.25 billion 3.417 billion with contingent consideration representing subsequent potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion 1.2 billion arising on the achievement of specified development targets and ongoing royalties based on the future sales performance of certain products, and so the total amount payable is unlimited.
The first milestone of $450 million 300 million was paid on 26 March 2015.
Other business acquisitions In addition, GSK completed one smaller Vaccines business acquisition for cash consideration of 120 million, net of cash acquired, and the fair value of existing investments of 15 million.

Acquisitions and disposals continued The non-controlling interest in the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture, calculated applying the full goodwill method, represents Novartis share of the net assets it contributed to the Joint Venture together with attributable goodwill.
The goodwill in the businesses acquired represents the potential for further synergies arising from combining the acquired businesses with GSKs existing businesses together with the value of the workforce acquired.
The majority of the goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Total transaction costs recognised in 2014 and 2015 for the acquisitions from Novartis amounted to 102 million.
Between 2 March 2015 and 31 December 2015, turnover of 1,941 million arising from the Novartis Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines businesses was included in Group turnover.
If the businesses had been acquired at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that Group turnover in 2015 would have been approximately 320 million higher.
These businesses have been integrated into the Groups existing activities and it is not practical to identify the impact on the Group profit in the period.
Business disposals Oncology GSK has divested its marketed Oncology business, related R&D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and also granted commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis for consideration of $16 billion 10,395 million before purchase adjustments.
Other business disposals GSK also made a number of small business disposals in the period for net cash consideration of 309 million.
Profit on disposal of the businesses has been determined as follows: Oncology Other m m Cash consideration including currency forwards and purchase adjustments 10,060 309 Net assets sold: Goodwill 497 14 Intangible assets 516 107 Property, plant and equipment 25 Inventory 51 Cash 5 Other net assets 6 1,013 208 Loss on currency forwards booked in 2014 299 Disposal costs 118 21 Profit on disposal 9,228 80 Associates and joint ventures During the year, GSK made cash investments of 16 million into associates and joint ventures.
In addition, in March 2015, GSK sold half of its shareholding in Aspen, representing 6.2% of the issued share capital of the company, for 571 million in cash.
As a result of the sale, the Group was no longer considered to have the ability to exert significant influence over Aspen and the Groups remaining investment was transferred from Investments in associates to Other investments.
