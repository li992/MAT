The annual management fee during the period under review was 0.45% of the total assets less current liabilities.
With effect from 1 May 2017 the annual management fee is 0.45% on the first 750 million of total assets and 0.33% on the remaining total assets, where total assets is defined as the total value of all assets held less all liabilities other than any liability in the form of borrowings intended for investment purposes.
The management fee is levied on all assets, including any holdings in collective investment schemes OEICs managed by Baillie Gifford & Co: however, the class of shares in any such OEICs held by the Company does not attract a management fee.
There were no such holdings during the year.

Factors that may affect future tax charges At 30 April 2017 the Company had a potential deferred tax asset of 9,246,000 2016 8,340,000 in respect of taxable losses which are available to be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been provided on these losses as it is considered unlikely that the Company will make suitable taxable revenue profits in excess of deductible expenses in future periods.
The potential deferred tax asset has been calculated using a corporation tax rate of 17% 2016 19%.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

15 Shareholders Funds 2017 2016 000 000 Shareholders funds 1,414,074 1,010,949 Shareholders funds have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 102.
However, the net asset value per share figures in note 16 have been calculated on the basis of shareholders rights to reserves as specified in the Articles of Association of the Company.
A reconciliation of the two figures is as follows: 2017 2016 Shareholders funds per ordinary share 660.9p 472.5p Expense of debenture issue 0.1p 0.1p Net asset value per ordinary share 660.8p 472.4p 44 Annual Report 2017 Financial Report 16 Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share The net asset value per ordinary share and the net assets attributable to the ordinary shareholders at the year end calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association were as follows: 2017 2016 2017 2016 000 000 Ordinary shares 660.8p 472.4p 1,413,884 1,010,726 2017 2016 000 000 The movements during the year of the assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows: Total net assets at 1 May 1,010,726 1,023,336 Return on ordinary activities after taxation 405,265 4,190 Dividends paid in the year 2,140 8,452 Amortisation of debenture issue expenses 33 32 Total net assets at 30 April 1,413,884 1,010,726 Net asset value per ordinary share is based on net assets adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debentures at par and on 213,963,859 2016 213,963,859 ordinary shares of 5p, being the number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end.
Shareholders funds as reported in the Balance Sheet has been computed in accordance with the provisions of FRS 102.
A reconciliation of the two sets of figures under these two conventions is given in note 15.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing net asset value per ordinary share from 660.8p to 656.8p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2017 of 653.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 0.6% as against 1.2% on a traditional basis.
At 30 April 2016 the effect would have been to reduce net asset value per ordinary share from 472.4p to 470.1p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2016 of 425.3p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 9.5% as against 10.0% on a traditional basis.
17 Contingent Liabilities, Guarantees and Financial Commitments At 30 April 2017 and 30 April 2016 the Company had no contingent liabilities, guarantees or financial commitments.
18 Related Party Transactions The Directors fees for the year are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 27.
No Director has a contract of service with the Company.
During the year no Director was interested in any contract or other matter requiring disclosure under section 412 of the Companies Act 2006.
19 Financial Instruments As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to secure its investment objective of capital growth.
The Company borrows money when the Board and Managers have sufficient conviction that the assets funded by borrowed monies will generate a return in excess of the cost of borrowing.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that cause short term variation in the Companys net assets and could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent reduction in the Companys net assets rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Manager both assesses the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitors the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9.
The Monks Investment Trust PLC 45 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Manager assesses the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the currency in which a companys share price is quoted is not necessarily the one in which it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on overseas earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the share price of the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts are used periodically to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Where appropriate, they are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objectives.
Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Currency Risk Sensitivity At 30 April 2017, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the Financial Statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2016.
2017 2016 000 000 US dollar 39,387 26,636 Japanese yen 4,797 4,555 Euro 5,631 4,277 Other overseas currencies 16,214 10,607 66,029 46,075 46 Annual Report 2017 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk Interest rate movements may affect directly: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: the fair value of derivative instruments linked to interest rates: the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate borrowings: and the interest payable on any variable rate borrowings which the Company may take out.
Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments other than its fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the fair value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value assuming that the Companys share price is unaffected by movements in interest rates.
The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 April is shown below.
Financial Assets 2017 2016 2017 Weighted 2016 Weighted 2017 Weighted average 2016 Weighted average Fair value average period Fair value average period 000 interest rate until maturity 000 interest rate until maturity Fixed rate: UK swap rate linked note 6,185 7.2% 5 months 5,933 7.2% 17 months Floating rate: UK swap rate linked note n a 5 months n a 17 months Fixed interest collective investment schemes: US dollar denominated funds 1,299 3 months This instrument comprises a zero coupon note issued by Credit Suisse and an option on sterling interest rate swaps.
The zero coupon element has a redemption value of 6.25m fair value 6,185,000 and the redemption value of the interest rate swap element fair value nil is based on a formula linked to thirty year sterling interest swap rates with higher amounts payable as rates rise.
Prior to redemption, the value of the interest rate swap element will vary depending on several factors such as the level of swap rates and the implied volatility of interest rate swap options.
The Monks Investment Trust PLC 47 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Financial Liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Companys bank loans and debentures at amortised cost and the maturity profile of the undiscounted future cash flows in respect of the Companys contractual financial liabilities at 30 April are shown below.

A decrease of 100 basis points would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 90,000 2016 increased by 174,000 and would have decreased net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 1.1p 2016 1.1p.
Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objective and investment policy.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity A full list of the Companys investments is shown on pages 9 to 11.
In addition, various analyses of the portfolio by growth category, thematic risk category, geography and broad industrial or commercial sector are contained in the Strategic Report.
