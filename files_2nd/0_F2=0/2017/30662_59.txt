Earnings per ordinary share Accounting policy The Group measures earnings per share on an underlying basis.
This differs from earnings fide ned in IAS 33 Earnings per share.
Underlying earnings is pro t loss attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted for pro ts or losses of a capital nature: amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent: and other infrequent and or exceptional transactions that are signi cant or material in the context of the Groups normal business earnings for the period.
The table below provides the basis of underlying earnings.

Financial instruments Classi cation and measurement Accounting policy The Group classi es its financial assets into the following measurement categories: financial assets held at fair value through pro t or loss: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity: or available-for-sale.
Financial liabilities are classi ed as either held at fair value through pro t or loss or at amortised cost.
Management determines the classi cation of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition.
The following details the approach for the categories: a Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through pro t or loss: This category has two sub-categories: Financial assets and liabilities held for trading: A financial asset or liability is classi ed as held for trading if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments which are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term pro t-taking or is a derivative excluding qualifying hedging relationships Designated at fair value through pro t or loss: Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through pro t or loss when: The designation eliminates or signi cantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis for example, the Group may designate certain xed rate loans and receivables that are managed with derivative interest rate swaps A group of financial assets and or liabilities is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis for example, the Group may designate issued debt to fund a portfolio of trading assets and liabilities that are all managed on a fair value basis The assets or liabilities include embedded derivatives and such derivatives are required to be recognised separately b Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and it is expected that apart from credit deterioration substantially all of the initial investment will be recovered.
227 Notes to the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS financial statements 13.
Financial instruments continued c H eld-to-maturity assets are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments and xed maturities that the Groups management has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
d Available-for-sale assets are those non-derivative financial assets intended to be held for an inde nite period of time, which may be sold in response to liquidity requirements or changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices.
e F inancial liabilities held at amortised cost: Financial liabilities, which include borrowings not classi ed as held at fair value through pro t or loss, are classi ed as amortised cost instruments.
Preference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a speci c date or at the option of the shareholders, are classi ed as financial liabilities and are presented in other borrowed funds.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
A financial guarantee issued is a special case of financial liability.
Under a financial guarantee contract, the Group, in return for a fee, undertakes to meet a customers obligations under the terms of a debt instrument if the customer fails to do so.
A financial guarantee is recognised as a liability: initially at fair value and, if not designated as at fair value through pro t or loss, subsequently at the higher of its initial value less cumulative amortisation and any provision under the contract measured in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Amortisation is calculated so as to recognise fees receivable in pro t or loss over the period of the guarantee.
Initial recognition of fi financial instruments All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price plus, for those financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value through pro t or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
In certain circumstances the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of pro ts or losses at the time of initial recognition.
However, these pro ts or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based primarily on observable market data.
In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement.
The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated.
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through pro t or loss, and financial assets classi ed as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale, are initially recognised on the trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way loans are recognised on settlement date when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through pro t or loss are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to the net trading income line in the income statement except for changes in fair value on financial liabilities designated at fair value attributable to the Groups own credit presented directly within other comprehensive income.
Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken to the available-forsale reserve within equity until the asset is sold, or is impaired, when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost, with any difference between proceeds net of directly attributable transaction costs and the redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
In addition to these instruments, the carrying value of a financial instrument carried at amortised cost that is the hedged item in a qualifying fair value hedge relationship is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
Derecognition Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred and the Group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished.
A financial liability is extinguished when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the balance sheet and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is included in other income.

Financial instruments continued Reclassi cation of financial instruments: Reclassi cations of financial assets or financial liabilities between measurement categories are not permitted following initial recognition, other than: Held for trading non-derivative financial assets can only be transferred out of the held at fair value through pro t or loss category in the following circumstances: to the available-for-sale category, where, in rare circumstances, they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term: or to the loan and receivables category, where they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term and they would have met the fide nition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassi cation and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity Financial assets can only be transferred out of the available-for-sale category to the loan and receivables category where they would have met the fide nition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassi cation and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity Change in comparatives Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending have been reported separately from loans and advances to banks and customers.
Similarly, repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing have been reported separately from deposits by banks and customer accounts.
Prior year comparatives have been re-presented to re ect this change.

In practice, for credit mitigation, the Group is able to offset assets and liabilities which do not meet the IAS 32 netting criteria set out above.
Such arrangements include master netting arrangements for derivatives and global master repurchase agreements for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions.
These agreements generally allow that all outstanding transactions with a particular counterparty can be offset but only in the event of default or other predetermined events.
In addition the Group also receives and pledges readily realisable collateral for derivative transactions to cover net exposure in the event of a default.
Under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements the Group pledges legally sells and obtains legally purchases respectively, highly liquid assets which can be sold in the event of a default.
The following tables set out the impact of netting on the balance sheet.
This comprises derivative transactions settled through an enforceable netting agreement where we have the intent and ability to settle net and which are offset on the balance sheet.

233 Notes to the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS financial statements 13.
Financial instruments continued Valuation of financial instruments Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal market or, in the absence of this, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date.
The fair value of a liability re ects the Groups non-performance risk.
The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on the basis of the individual financial instrument.
However, when a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis.
The fair values of quoted financial assets and liabilities in active markets are based on current prices.
A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with suf cient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash ow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison with instruments that have characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
The Valuation Control function is responsible for independent price veri cation, oversight of fair value and prudent value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues.
Independent price veri cation is the process of determining that the valuations incorporated into the financial statements are validated independent of the business area responsible for the product.
The Valuation Control function has oversight of the fair value adjustments to ensure the financial instruments are priced to exit.
These are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements.
The market data used for price veri cation may include data sourced from recent trade data involving external counterparties or third parties such as Bloomberg, Reuters, brokers and consensus pricing providers.
Valuation Control performs a semi-annual review of the suitability of the market data used for price testing.
Price veri cation uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market the instruments trade in.
To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliability, availability of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration.
Formal committees for the business clusters, consisting of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Control and the business meet monthly to discuss and approve the valuations of the inventory.
For Principal Finance, the Investment Committee meeting is held on a quarterly basis to review investments and valuations.
The business cluster valuation committees fall under the Valuation Benchmarks Committee as part the of the valuation governance structure.
Signifi cant accounting estimates and judgements The Group evaluates the signi cance of financial instruments and material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements as they involve a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty in determining the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Fair value of financial instruments are determined using valuation techniques see below which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Changes in the observability of signi cant valuation inputs can materially affect the fair values of financial instruments When establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers valuation adjustments in determining the fair value page 236 In determining the valuation of financial instruments, the Group makes judgements on the amounts reserved to cater for model and valuation risks, which cover both Level 2 and Level 3 assets, and the signi cant valuation judgements in respect of Level 3 instruments page 237 Where the measurement of fair value is more judgemental in respect of Level 3 assets, these are valued based on models that use a signi cant degree of non-market-based unobservable inputs Valuation techniques Refer to the fair value hierarchy explanation Level 1, 2 and 3 page 237 Financial instruments held at fair value Loans and advances: These include loans in the global syndications business which were not syndicated as of the balance sheet date and other nancing transactions within Financial Markets.
These loans are generally bilateral in nature and, where available, their valuation is based on market observable credit spreads.
If observable credit spreads are not available, proxy spreads based on comparable loans with similar credit grade, sector, and region, are used.
Where observable credit spreads and market standard proxy methods are available, these loans are classi ed as Level 2.
Where there are no recent transactions or comparable loans, these loans are classi ed as Level 3 Debt securities asset backed securities: Asset backed securities are priced based on external prices obtained from consensus pricing providers, broker quotes, recent trades, arrangers quotes, etc.
Where an observable price is available for a given security, it is classi ed as Level 2.
In instances where third-party prices are not available or reliable, the security is classi ed as Level 3.
The fair value of Level 3 securities is estimated using market standard cash ow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings.
Therefore, once external pricing has been veri ed, an assessment is made whether each security is traded with signi cant liquidity based on its credit rating and sector.
If a security is of high credit rating and is traded in a liquid sector, it will be classi ed as Level 2, otherwise it will be classi ed as Level 3 Standard Chartered 234 Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Directors report Risk review and capital review FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Supplementary information 13.
Financial instruments continued Valuation techniques continued Other debt securities: These debt securities include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes.
Where quoted prices are available through pricing vendors, brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets, these are classi ed as Level 2 and valued using such quotes.
Where there are signi cant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market, due to illiquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classi ed as Level 3.
The valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads.
These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer if available or proxied from comparable issuers or assets Equity shares private equity: The majority of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples Price-toEarnings P E or enterprise value to earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortisation EV EBITDA ratios of comparable listed companies.
The two primary inputs for the valuation of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies.
To ensure comparability between these unquoted investments and the comparable listed companies, appropriate adjustments are also applied for example, liquidity and size in the valuation.
In circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced from reliable external sources, alternate valuation techniques for example, discounted cash ow models, which use predominantly unobservable inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied.
Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third-party sources for example, Bloomberg, and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments excluding those where observable inputs are available, for example, over-the-counter OTC prices are classi ed as Level 3 on the basis that the valuation methods involve judgments ranging from determining comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cash ow method is applied Derivatives: Derivative products are classi ed as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from independent and reliable market data sources.
Derivative products are classi ed as Level 3 if there are signi cant valuation input parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying variable.
Examples are foreign exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying indices and interest rate products with quanto payouts.
In most cases these unobservable correlation parameters cannot be implied from the market, and methods such as historical analysis and comparison with historical levels or other benchmark data must be employed Debt securities in issue: These debt securities relate to structured notes issued by the Group.
Where independent market data is available through pricing vendors and broker sources these positions are classi ed as Level 2.
Where such liquid external prices are not available, valuation of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads, and are classi ed as Level 3.
These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer if available or proxies from comparable issuers or assets Financial instruments held at amortised cost The following sets out the Groups basis of establishing fair values of amortised cost financial instruments and their classi cation between Levels 1, 2 and 3.
As certain categories of financial instruments are not actively traded, there is a signi cant level of management judgement involved in calculating the fair values: Cash and balances at central banks: The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts Loans and advances to banks and customers: For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of oating rate placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amounts.
The estimated fair value of xed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash ows using the prevailing money market rates for debts with a similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
The Groups loans and advances to the customers portfolio is well diversi ed by geography and industry.
Approximately a quarter of the portfolio re-prices within one month, and approximately half re-prices within 12 months.
Loans and advances are presented net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value.
The estimated fair value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one year represents the discounted amount of future cash ows expected to be received, including assumptions relating to prepayment rates and, credit risk credit spreads.
Expected cash ows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value.
The Group has a wide range of individual instruments within its loans and advances portfolio and as a result providing quanti cation of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impractical Investment securities: For investment securities that do not have directly observable market values, the Group utilises a number of valuation techniques to determine fair value.
Where available, securities are valued using inputs proxies from the same or closely related underlying for example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer or inputs proxies from a different underlying for example, a similar bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating.
Certain instruments cannot be proxies as set out above, and in such cases the positions are valued using non-market observable inputs.
This includes those instruments held at amortised cost and predominantly relates to asset backed securities.
The fair value for such instruments is usually proxies from internal assessments of the underlying cash ows Deposits and borrowings: The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand.
The estimated fair value of xed interest bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cash ows using the prevailing market rates for debts with a similar credit risk and remaining maturity Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds: The aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash ow model is used based on a current market-related yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity Other assets: Other assets comprise primarily of cash collateral and trades pending settlement.
The carrying amount of these financial instruments is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value as they are either short term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently 235 Notes to the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS financial statements 13.
Financial instruments continued Fair value adjustments When establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers adjustments to the modelled price which market participants would make when pricing that instrument.
The main valuation adjustments described further below in determining fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows: 2017 2016 $million $million Bid-offer valuation adjustment 82 106 CVA 229 466 DVA 66 23 Model valuation adjustment 6 6 FVA 79 248 Others including day one 148 132 Total 478 935 Bid-offer valuation adjustment: Where market parameters are marked on a mid-market basis in the revaluation systems, a bid offer valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralising the business positions through dealing away in the market, thereby bringing long positions to bid and short positions to offer.
The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves netting between long and short positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where long positions are marked to bid and short positions marked to offer in the systems Credit valuation adjustment CVA : The Group makes CVA adjustment against the fair value of derivative products.
CVA is an adjustment to the fair value of the transactions to re ect the possibility that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of the outstanding transactions.
It represents an estimate of the adjustment a market participant would include when deriving a purchase price to acquire our exposures.
CVA is calculated for each subsidiary, and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure and takes account of any collateral we may hold.
The Group calculates the CVA by applying the probability of default PD on the potential estimated future positive exposure of the counterparty using market-implied PD.
Where market-implied data is not readily available, we use market-based proxies to estimate the PD.
Wrong-way risk arises when the underlying value of the derivative prior to any CVA is positively correlated to the probability of default by the counterparty and the Group has implemented a model to capture this impact for certain key wrong way exposures.
The Group continues to include wrong-way risk in its Prudential Valuation Adjustments Debit valuation adjustment DVA : The Group calculates DVA adjustments on its derivative liabilities to re ect changes in its own credit standing.
The Groups DVA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and, conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves.
The Groups DVA adjustments will reverse over time as its derivatives mature.
For derivative liabilities, a DVA adjustment is determined by applying the Groups probability of default to the Groups negative expected exposure against the counterparty.
The Groups probability of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on internally assessed credit ratings and market standard recovery levels.
The expected exposure is modelled based on simulation methodology and is generated through simulation of underlying risk factors over the life of the deal booked against the particular counterparty.
This simulation methodology incorporates the collateral posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements.
In December 2017, the Group re ned its methodology used to calculate DVA to better align with current industry practice.
This change in calculation methodology is treated as a change in estimate and resulted in an increase in the DVA balance of $66 million Model valuation adjustment: Valuation models may have pricing fide ciencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment.
These pricing fide ciencies or limitations arise due to the choice, implementation and calibration of the pricing model Funding valuation adjustment FVA : The Group makes FVA adjustments against derivative products.
FVA re ects an estimate of the adjustment to its fair value that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs that could arise in relation to the exposure.
FVA is calculated by determining the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures that re ect the market cost of funding.
The FVA for collateralised derivatives is based on discounting the expected future cash ows at the relevant overnight indexed swap OIS rate after taking into consideration the terms of the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty.
The FVA for uncollateralised including partially collateralised derivatives incorporates the estimated present value of the market funding cost or bene t associated with funding these transactions Day one pro t and loss: In certain circumstances the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of pro ts or losses at the time of initial recognition.
The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated In addition, the Group calculates own credit adjustment OCA on its issued debt designated at fair value, including structured notes, in order to re ect changes in its own credit standing.
The Groups OCA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and, conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves.
The Groups OCA adjustments will reverse over time as its liabilities mature.
For issued debt and structured notes designated at fair value, an OCA adjustment is determined by discounting the contractual cash ows using a yield curve adjusted for market observed secondary senior debt issuance spreads above average interbank rates.
The OCA is $82 million 2016: $331 million.

Financial instruments continued Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments held at fair value Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classi ed into three levels according to the observability of the signi cant inputs used to determine the fair values.
Changes in the observability of signi cant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a signi cant change in either its principal market or the level of observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques as at the end of the reporting period.
Level 1: Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: Fair value measurements are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all signi cant inputs are observable Level 3: Fair value measurements are those where at least one input which could have a signi cant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data The following tables show the classi cation of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets $million $million $million $million Financial instruments held at fair value through pro t or loss Loans and advances to banks 2,501 71 2,572 Loans and advances to customers 2,792 126 2,918 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending 912 912 Debt securities and other eligible bills 5,860 13,800 51 19,711 Of which: Government bonds and treasury bills 4,988 5,531 10,519 Issued by corporates other than financial institutions 171 4,017 48 4,236 Issued by financial institutions 701 4,252 3 4,956 Equity shares 725 726 1,451 Derivative financial instruments 402 46,589 40 47,031 Of which: Foreign exchange 97 35,641 17 35,755 Interest rate 210,065 7 10,074 Commodity 303 609 2 914 Credit 249 249 Equity and stock index 25 14 39 Investment securities Debt securities and other eligible bills 61,246 47,511 404 109,161 Of which: Government bonds and treasury bills 51,257 21,364 318 72,939 Issued by corporates other than financial institutions 5,648 7,590 86 13,324 Issued by financial institutions 4,341 18,557 22,898 Equity shares 369 5 520 894 Total financial instruments at 31 December 2017 68,602 114,110 1,938 184,650 Liabilities Financial instruments held at fair value through pro t or loss Deposits by banks 668 69 737 Customer accounts 5,236 5,236 Debt securities in issue 6,581 442 7,023 Short positions 1,495 2,142 3,637 Derivative financial instruments 470 47,606 25 48,101 Of which: Foreign exchange 90 36,149 36,239 Interest rate 99,851 18 9,878 Commodity 371 590 961 Credit 871 2 873 Equity and stock index 145 5 150 Total financial instruments at 31 December 2017 1,965 62,233 536 64,734 There have been no signi cant changes to valuation or levelling approaches in 2017.

Financial instruments continued Level 3 summary and signi cant unobservable inputs continued The following section describes the signi cant unobservable inputs identi ed in the valuation technique table: Commodities correlation: This refers to the correlation between two commodity underlyings over a speci ed time Comparable price yield is a valuation methodology in which a price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where there are no direct observable prices.
Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cashows in a discounted cashow model.
Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield or spread over a liquid benchmark from the price of a comparable instrument, then adjusting that yield or spread to derive a value for the instrument.
The adjustment should account for relevant differences in the financial instruments such as maturity and or credit quality.
Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument for example, deriving a fair value for a junior unsecured bond from the price of a senior secured bond.
An increase in price, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the asset.
An increase in yield, in isolation, would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable in uences the movement in another variable.
An equity correlation is the correlation between two equity instruments while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates Credit spread represents the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument Discount rate refers to the rate of return used to convert expected cash ows into present value EV EBITDA ratio multiples: This is the ratio of Enterprise Value EV to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA.
EV is the aggregate market capitalisation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents.
An increase in EV EBITDA multiples in isolation, will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted rm Interest rate curves is the term structure of interest rates and measure of future interest rates at a particular point in time Liquidity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments: A liquidity discount is primarily applied to the valuation of unlisted rms investments to re ect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded.
An increase in liquidity discount will result in unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted rm Price-Book P B multiple: This is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity.
An increase in P B multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted rm Price-Earnings P E multiples: This is the ratio of the Market Capitalisation to the Net Income after tax.
The multiples are determined from multiples of listed comparables, which are observable.
An increase in P E multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted rm Price-Sales P S multiple: This is the ratio of the market value of equity to sales.
An increase in P S multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted rm Recovery rates are the expectation of the rate of return resulting from the liquidation of a particular loan.
As the probability of default increases for a given instrument, the valuation of that instrument will increasingly re ect its expected recovery level assuming default.
An increase in the recovery rate, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the loan Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time.
Generally, the higher the volatility, the more expensive the option will be 241 Notes to the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS financial statements 13.

The Group applies a 10 per cent increase or decrease on the values of these unobservable inputs, to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
The percentage shift is determined by statistical analyses performed on a set of reference prices based on the composition of our Level 3 assets.
Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters.
This Level 3 sensitivity analysis assumes a one-way market move and does not consider offsets for hedges.
