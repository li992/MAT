Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is 395KingStreet, Aberdeen, AB24 5RP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic report on pages4 to 42.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
2 Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted and endorsed for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and on agoing concern basis as described in the going concern statement within the directors report and additional disclosures on pages 80 to 83.
Theprincipal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 include the results and financial position of the First Rail business for the year ended 31 March 2017 and the results and financial position of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 25 March 2017.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 include the results and financial position of the First Rail businesses for the year ended 31 March 2016 and the results and financial position of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2016.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so astoobtain benefits from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of their fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis.
Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisitions method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, with the exception of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements, liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquirees share-based payment and non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Thiscondition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the dateof classification.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 91 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units CGUs which are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated to the goodwill of the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being testedfor impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included indetermining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Computer software is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include software licences, website development, costs attributable to the development, design and implementation ofthe computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the software.
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives asfollows: Customer contracts over the estimated life of the contract 9 to 10 years Greyhound brand and trade name over the estimated life of the brand 20 years Franchise agreements over the initial term of the franchise 2 to 10 years Software over the estimated life of the software 3 to 5 years Revenue recognition Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance services in the UK and North America.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as the proportion of total services to be provided.
Receipts for season tickets and travel cards are deferred within Season ticket deferred income and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
Revenue in First Rail includes franchise subsidy receipts from the Department for Transport DfT and amounts receivable under franchise arrangements including certain funded operational projects.
Franchise premium payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are included in operating costs.
Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the Train Operating Companies TOCs, predominantly based on models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts.
First Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes.
Concessionary amounts are recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises of amounts receivable from ticket sales.
Other Bus, including First Student and First Transit, and services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations is recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the lifeof the lease.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve aconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
92 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies see note 24 for details of the Groups policies in respect of foreign exchange risks.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at the closing exchange rates on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the average or actual exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take asubstantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Non-GAAP measures and performance In measuring the Group adjusted operating performance, additional financial measures derived from the reported results have been used in order to eliminate factors which distort year-on-year comparisons.
The Groups adjusted performance is used to explain year-on-year changes when the effect of certain items are significant, including restructuring and reorganisation costs relating to the business turnarounds, property disposals, aged legal and self-insurance claims, revisions to onerous contracts and pension settlement gains or losses.
In addition, management assess divisional performance before other intangible asset amortisation charges as these are typically a result of Group decisions and therefore the divisions have little or no control over these charges.
Management consider that this overall basis more appropriately reflects operating performance and provide a better understanding of the key performance indicators of the business.
See note 4 for the reconciliation to nonGAAP measures and performance.
Subsequent revisions to adjusting items are also recognised as an adjusting item in future periods.
In the current year non-GAAP adjusting items principally relate to other intangible asset amortisation charges, property disposals and restructuring and reorganisation costs relating to the business turnarounds.
In the prior year the non-GAAP adjusting items principally related to other intangible asset amortisation charges, pension past service gain, aged self-insurance and legal claims and business disposals.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both defined benefit schemes and defined contributionschemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial updates being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
All past service costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Where changes to the benefits in payment on defined benefit pension schemes require a change in scheme rules or ratification by the Trustees, the change is recognised as a past service charge or credit in the income statement.
Where changes in assumptions can be made without changing the Trustee agreement, these are recognised as a change in assumptions in other comprehensive income.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 93 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued The retirement benefit position recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as reduced by thefair value of scheme assets.
Any residual asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds.
Various TOCs in the First Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
The Group is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held.
The full liability is recognised on the balance sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reflects the Groups obligations to fund the scheme over the franchise term.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and includes an estimate of the tax which could be payable as a result of differing interpretation of tax laws.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in jointventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised and is based on the estimated tax consequences of items that are subject to differing interpretations of tax laws.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities andwhen they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on anetbasis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold buildings 50 years straight-line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight-line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 17 years straight-line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight-line Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Capital grants Capital grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Capital grants are not recognised until there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
94 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated inorder to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flows.
Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classified into one of three primary categories: Fair value through profit and loss This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the profit and loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and the carrying value in all cases approximates to the fair value.
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash.
The most significant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the Groups First Rail subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies up to the lower of the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios.
The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Bonds and loan notes These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments forspeculative purposes.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty confirmations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the amortisation of debt issuance fees in respect of the accounting period and reduced by repayments made in the period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required tosettle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Amounts due within 12 months of the balance sheet date are considered to be reliably measured and are therefore included within accruals.
Self-insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
In addition there are typically a smaller number ofmajor claims during a financial year for which cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies subject to an insurance deductible.
Provision is made under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets for the estimated cost of settling uninsured claims forincidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
The provision is discounted to appropriately reflect the timing of future cash claimssettlements.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value atthe date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes or other appropriate valuation models.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
96 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations for annual periods beginning on or after the effective dates as noted below: Effective for accounting periods IAS IFRS standards starting on or after 1 Amendments to IAS 12 January 2016 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 1 January 2017 1 Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2017 1 Amendments to IFRS 12 December 2016 Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2014-2016 1 January 2017 Cycle clarifying scope IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 1 Amendments to IFRS 2 June 2016 Classification and Measurement of Share-Based Payment 1 January 2018 transactions 1 Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2018 1 Amendments to IAS 28 December 2016 Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2014-2016 1 January 2018 Cycle clarifying certain fair value measurements 1 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 September 2014 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and Immediately itsAssociate or Joint Venture 1 The mandatory adoption under EU adopting regulations has not yet been confirmed.
The Directors do not anticipate the adoption of these other standards will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initial application other than the following: IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments.
This standard covers the classification, measurement, impairment and fide-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the new hedge accounting model.
IFRS 9 may impact the measurement and disclosure of the Groups financial instruments.
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 18 Revenue.
This standard requires the separation of performance obligations within contracts with customers, and the contractual value to be allocated to each of the performance obligations.
Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.
The standard provides for one of two methods of transition: retrospective application to each prior period or recognition of the cumulative effects of retrospective recognition of the new standard.
We have not yet decided which transition method we will use.
While we continue to assess the impacts of the standard, we do not expect adoption to have a significant impact on the Groups revenue recognition.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement, and will replace IAS 17 Leases.
This standard requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset is oflow value.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group holds a significant number of operating leases, which currently, under IAS 17, are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.
An initial assessment is being performed and it is anticipated that transition to IFRS 16 will have a material impact on both assets and liabilities of the Group and will reduce operating costs and increase financecosts.
The Group will continue to monitor the impact until the transition date, providing further quantitative and qualitative measures as progress is made on implementation planning.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Adoption of new and revised standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for a number of new and revised Standards and Interpretations which have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 97 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgments and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
i Critical accounting judgments Defined benefit pension arrangements The UK schemes retirement benefit obligations are discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds.
Significant judgment is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.
The most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate bonds, quality of the bonds and the identification of outliers which are excluded.
Management follows actuarial advice from a third party when determining these judgments.
The carrying amount of the Groups retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2017 was a liability of 358.5m 2016: 270.9m.
Further details and sensitivities are set our in note 34. ii Key sources of estimation uncertainty Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 1,956.1m 2016: 1,736.3m as set out in note 11 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was 150.6m 2016: 162.2m as set out in note 12.
Self-insurance Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance using managements best estimate of the likely settlement of these incidents.
The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice and the amount provided is adjusted as required.
The self-insurance reserve is most sensitive to favourable or adverse developments on individual significant claims.
The Groups total self-insurance provisions, including those classified within accruals, as at the balance sheet date were 391.0m 2016:363.8m as set out in note26.
Contract and franchise accounting Estimates are made on an ongoing basis with regards to the recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets and liabilities arising from franchises and long term service contracts.
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of franchises and contracts, which require assessments and estimates relating to the expected levels of profitability and, in cases where options exist, the life of the contract or franchise.
The useful economic lives of assets are determined by reference to the length of a franchise and matched to the franchise end date.
The residual value of assets is determined by their condition at the franchise end date and by the amount of maintenance that has been carried out during the period of operation.
In particular, First Rail has a number of contractual relationships including those with the DfT and Network Rail which given their complexity and duration can be sensitive to changes in future assumptions.
Due to the regulated nature of the rail industry, disputes and claims typically arise with such bodies as well as other TOCs where one or more TOCs have access to common infrastructure such as railway lines.
Management is required to estimate the amounts receivable and also payable taking account of the information available at the time.
Uncertain tax positions Uncertainties exist in relation to differing interpretations of complex tax law in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
It may take several years to determine the final tax consequences of certain transactions in some jurisdictions.
The tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group are based on judgments made by management on the application of tax laws and managements estimate of the future amounts that will be agreed with tax authorities.
Further details on the tax on profit on ordinary activities are set out in note 9.
There is a risk that the amounts eventually agreed with tax authorities may differ from the amounts recognised by the Group and would lead to future adjustments to tax assets and liabilities currently recognised, impacting future tax charges.

The increase primarily reflects a higher charge in the North America divisions due to the impact of foreign exchange and an incremental 6.6m software intangible amortisation this year, partly offset by a lower charge in FirstRail as the GWR franchise intangible was fully expensed at the end of its first Direct Award period.
Gain on disposal of property During the year the sale of a Greyhound terminal in San Jose, California was completed which resulted in a gain on sale of 21.6m 2016: nil.
Restructuring and reorganisation costs There was a charge of 16.8m 2016: nil in the year for restructuring and reorganisation costs across the Group relating to the business turnarounds.
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives There was a 1.0m non-cash credit 2016: 0.4m charge during the year due to ineffectiveness on financial derivatives.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 5 Business segments and geographical information For management purposes, the Group is organised into five operating divisions First Student, First Transit, Greyhound, First Bus and First Rail.
These divisions are managed separately in line with the differing services that they provide and the geographical markets which they operate in.
The principal activities of these divisions are described in the Strategic report.
2 EBITDA is adjusted operating profit less capital grant amortisation plus depreciation.
3 Although the segment results are used by management to measure performance, statutory operating profit by operating division is also disclosed forcompleteness.
4 Segment assets and liabilities are determined by identifying the assets and liabilities that relate to the business of each segment but excluding intercompany balances, net debt and taxation.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 20% 2016: 20% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
As the Groups parent company is domiciled and listed in the UK the Group uses the UK corporation tax rate to reconcile its effective tax rate.
Thetax charge for the year can be reconciled to the UK corporation tax rate as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 m % m % Profit before tax 152.6 100.0 113.5 100.0 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 20% 2016: 20% 30.5 20.0 22.7 20.0 Recurring items: Non deductible expenditure 1.4 0.9 2.2 1.9 Non taxable income 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 Tax rates outside of the UK 26.0 17.0 7.6 6.7 Unrecognised losses 3.1 2.0 3.8 3.4 Financing deductions 5.6 3.6 6.3 5.5 Non-recurring items: Unrecognised losses 4.6 3.0 Impact of reduction in UK tax rate 0.2 0.1 1.1 1.0 Reduction in tax provisions for uncertain tax positions relating to prior years 20.7 13.5 10.6 9.3 Other adjustments in relation to prior years 2.7 1.8 1.0 0.9 Tax charge and effective tax rate for the year 36.5 23.9 17.1 15.1 The Group recognises provisions in respect of tax for items which are considered to have a range of possible tax outcomes in its open tax returns and its ongoing tax audits in respect of multiple years.
These uncertainties exist due to a number of factors including differing interpretations of local tax laws.
The nature of the assumptions made by management when calculating the carrying amounts relate to the estimated tax which could be payable as a result of differing interpretations and decisions by tax authorities in respect of transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
The group maintains engagement with tax authorities and engagement with peer groups that may have similar issues.
Weengage advisers to obtain opinion on tax legislation and we monitor proposed changes in legislation.
The reduction in tax provisions for uncertain tax positions relating to prior years comprises adjustments to both current tax and deferred tax.
Thecurrent tax prior year adjustments primarily relates to the release of tax provisions resulting from the closure of tax audits during the year to31March 2017.
The deferred tax prior year adjustments arise from the closure of earlier tax years as a result of the passage of time leading toareduction in tax provisions and additional deferred tax assets.
Should certain tax returns be closed as a result of the passage of time in the nextfinancial year then the amount required to be provided in deferred tax could reduce by up to 5m.
Future years tax charges would be impacted if the final liability for currently open years is different from the amount currently provided for.
The future tax charge may also be affected by the levels and mix of profits in the countries in which we operate including differing foreign exchange rates that apply to those profits.
Changes to the prevailing tax rates and tax rules in any of the countries in which we operate may also impact future tax charges.
At the balance sheet date changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 have been substantively enacted.
In addition to the amount credited charged to the income statement, deferred tax relating to actuarial losses on defined benefit pension schemes 7.3 m 2016: 16.1 m and cash flow and net investment hedges 19.0m 2016: 0.6 m, amounting to a total charge credit of 11.7m 2016: 16.7 m has been recognised in other comprehensive income.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2017 2016 m m Carrying amount First Student 1,271.1 1,123.0 First Transit 309.5 273.2 Greyhound 291.9 257.6 First Bus 78.0 76.9 First Rail 5.6 5.6 1,956.1 1,736.3 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 11 Goodwill continued Impairment testing At the year end the carrying value of goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
For the purposes ofthis impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2017 18 and Three Year Plan projections up to 2019 20 2016: Three Year Plan projections up to 2018 19 which take account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
The projections for First Student assume the incremental benefits of the existing recovery plan, the programme to address contract portfolio pricing together with an economic recovery.
Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates of 2.5% 2016: 2.5% for the United Kingdom and 3.0% 2016: 3.0% for North America which do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the market.
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 7.3% 2016: 8.1% for the United Kingdom CGUs and 8.7% 2016: 8.9% for the North American CGUs to arrive at the value in use.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are derived from a market participants weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the Groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each CGU and to be realistic in the light of economic and industry forecasts.
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and confirms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount in respect of the First Transit, Greyhound, First Bus and First Rail divisions.
The value in use of the First Student division exceeds its carrying amount by 709.2m 2016: 232.3m.
The sensitivity analysis indicates that the First Student margin or growth rates would need to fall in excess of 218 or 184 basis points respectively compared to medium term double digit margin expectations for there to be an impairment to the carrying value of net assets in this business.
An increase in the discount rate in excess of161 basis points would lead to the value in use of the division being less than its carrying amount.
Following their review of goodwill the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment to any of the CGUs.

Credit risk exists in relation to the Groups financial assets, which comprise trade and other receivables of 790.9m 2016: 694.4m, cash and cash equivalents of 400.9m 2016: 360.1m and derivative financial instruments of 50.3m 2016: 58.2m.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk for all financial assets at the balance sheet date was 1,242.1m 2016: 1,112.7m.
The exposure isspread over a large number of unconnected counterparties and the maximum single concentration with any one counterparty was 62.0m 2016: 75.0m at the balance sheet date.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was 4.2m 2016: 4.3m.
Most trade receivables are with public or quasi public bodies, principally the DfT, Network Rail and city councils in the UK and school bus boards and city municipal authorities in North America.
The Group does not consider any of these counterparties to be a significant risk.
Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade receivables.
The counterparties for bank balances and derivative financial instruments are mainly represented by lending banks and large banks with aminimum of A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board.
Grouptreasury policy limits the maximum deposit with any one counterparty to 75m, and limits the maximum term to three months.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 115 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Derivative financial instruments continued The following gains and losses on derivatives designated for hedge accounting have been charged through the consolidated income statement in the year: 2017 2016 m m Losses on hedging instruments in fair value hedges 9.5 4.1 Gains on hedged item attributable to hedged risk fair value hedges 10.2 3.8 Change in the fair value of derivatives classified as held for trading 0.3 1.0 0.3 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk and certain market-based risks principally being the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices.
The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by the Board.
Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the Chief Financial Officer and to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee comprises the Chief Financial Officer and certain senior finance employees and is responsible for approving hedging transactions permitted under Board approved policies, monitoring compliance against policy and recommending changes to existing policies.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The objective of the Groups liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient committed liquidity resources exist.
The Group has a diversified debt structure largely represented by medium term unsecured syndicated committed bank facilities, medium to long term unsecured bond debt and finance leases.
Itisa policy requirement that debt obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 150m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates.
At year end, the total amount of these facilities stood at 800.0m 2016: 800.0m, and committed headroom was 800.0m 2016: 800.0m, in addition to free cash balances of 141.1m 2016: 140.2m.
The next material contractual expiry of revolver bank facilities is in July 2021.
Largely due to the seasonality of the First Student school bus business, headroom tends to reduce from March to October and increases again by the following March.
The average duration of net debt excluding ring-fenced cash at 31 March 2017 was 3.6 years 2016: 4.4 years.
The following tables detail the Groups expected maturity of payables receivables for its derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables.
The amounts in these tables are different to the balance sheet as the table is prepared on an undiscounted cash flow basis.
Total amounts receivable per the tables are 70.3m 2016: 92.4m.
No derivative financial instruments had collateral requirements or were due on demand in any of the years.
116 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 24 Derivative financial instruments continued Currency risk Currency risk is the risk of financial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash flows reported in pounds Sterling due to movements in exchange rates.
The Groups principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant.
Consequently, the principal currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to pounds Sterling.
Certain and highly probable foreign currency transaction exposures may be hedged at the time the exposure arises for up to two years at specified levels, or longer if there is a very high degree of certainty.
The Group does not hedge the translation of earnings into the Group reporting currency pounds Sterling, but accepts that reported Group earnings will fluctuate as exchange rates against pounds Sterling fluctuate for the currencies in which the company does business.
During the year, the net cash generated in each currency may be converted by Group Treasury into pounds Sterling by way of spot transactions in order to keep the currency composition of net debt broadly constant.
IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on profit after tax and hedging reserve on financial instruments from a movement in exchange rates.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar.
The analysis has been prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period.
Apositive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.
2017 2016 m m Impact on profit after tax 4.8 9.9 Impact on hedging reserve 2.2 6.8 Interest rate risk The Group has variable rate debt and cash and therefore net income is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates.
The Group treasury policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum of 50% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility is substantially reduced year on year to EPS.
The policy objective is primarily achieved through fixed rate debt.
The main floating rate benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and pounds Sterling LIBOR.
This fixed rate protection had an average duration of 3.7 years 2016: 4.6 years.
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing fixed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
Fair value changes in the 250.0m 2019 and the 350.0m 2021 Sterling bonds relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps.
These swaps offset the fair value movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bonds.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis points 1% increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant.
2017 2016 m m Impact on profit after tax 1.9 1.8 Interest rate hedges The following table details the notional amounts of interest rate swap contracts designated as a cash flow or fair value hedge which were outstanding at the reporting date, the average fixed rate payable or receivable under these swaps and their fair value.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly or semi-annual basis.
The differences between the fixed and floating rates are settled on a net basis.

The Groups policy objective is to maintain a significant degree of fixed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are protected from any sudden and significant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access for potentially lower costs over the medium term.
The Group primarily uses fixed rate swap instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty.
During the year to 31 March 2017, the Group was hedged 81% on fuel price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2017 to March 2020 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to 31March 2018.
The swaps give rise to monthly cash flow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of floating price costs, except where they have a deferred start date.
Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on qualifying hedges to achieve fixed rate fuel costs within operating results.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity on profit after tax and equity if the price of crude oil had been $10 per barrel higher at the year end: 2017 2016 m m Impact on profit after tax 3.2 2.5 Impact on hedging reserve 23.7 27.3 Volume at risk for the year to 31 March 2018 is 3.2m year to 31 March 2017: 3.2m barrels for which 75% is hedged to diesel price risk.

The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that the majority of such claims will be settled within the next six years although certain liabilities in respect of lifetime obligations of 21.7m 2016: 20.3m can extend for up to 30 years.
The utilisation of 194.3m 2016: 153.6m represents payments made largely against the current liability of the preceding year.
Amounts charged to the income statement for insurance claims contains 27.7m which is recoverable from insurance companies and is included within other receivables in note 17.
Legal and other provisions relate to estimated exposures for cases filed or thought highly likely to be filed for incidents that occurred prior to thebalance sheet date.
It is anticipated that most of these items will be settled within 10 years.
Also included are provisions in respect of costs anticipated on the exit of surplus properties which are expected to be settled over the remaining terms of the respective leases and dilapidation and other provisions in respect of contractual obligations under rail franchises.
The dilapidation provisions are expected to be settled at the end ofthe respective franchise.
The pensions provision relates to unfunded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain First Bus companies.
It is anticipated that this will be utilised over five to 10 years.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that, amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an entitlement vests.
The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it.
Fair values for the SAYE include a 10% per annum pre-vesting leaver assumption whereas the Executive, LTIP and deferred share plans exclude any allowance for pre-vesting forfeitures.

There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution plan if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
UK The Group operates defined contribution plans for all Group and First Bus employees who have joined a pension arrangement since April 2013.
They receive a Company match to their contributions, which varies by salary and or service.
North America Employees in the US have been able to join a defined contribution arrangement for many years.
They receive a Company match which varies by employment status.
All new employees in Canada join a defined contribution arrangement.
Union employees join the Eastern or Western plan, whilst managers and supervisors join the Supervisory plan.
They receive a Company contribution dependent on their personal contribution and the plan they are in.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement of 23.0m 2016: 18.2m represents contributions payable to these plans bythe Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit plans The Group sponsors 12 funded defined benefit plans across its non-rail operations, covering approximately 50,000 former and current employees.
UK The majority of defined benefit provision is through trust-based schemes.
These arrangements are closed to new entrants.
The assets of the trust-based schemes are invested separately from those of the Group, and the schemes are run independently of the Group bytrustee boards.
There is a requirement for the trustee boards to have some member representation, with the other trustee directors being company appointed.
The Trustee is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the fund, although the Company must be consulted on this, and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Triennial valuations assess the cost of future service and the funding position.
The Company and Trustee are required to agree on assumptions for the valuations and to agree the contributions that result from these.
Deficit recovery contributions may be required in addition to future service contributions.
In agreeing contribution rates, reference must be made to the affordability of contributions by the employer.
In most arrangements, any surplus after benefits have been paid secured, can be repaid to the employer.
The First UK Bus Pension Scheme This provides pension benefits to employees in First Bus.
Historically it provided salary related benefits on a shared cost basis, but from April 2013, all new members have been enrolled in the defined contribution section.
The funding level of the scheme on 5 April 2017 failed to reach a pre-agreed funding level, and as such, the scheme will close to defined benefit accrual on 5 April 2018.
A smaller Group scheme provides defined benefit pensions to Group employees.
This scheme is closed to new entrants and the Company intends to close to defined benefit accrual on 5 April 2018.
Local Government Pension Schemes The Group participates in five Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS, three in England and two in Scotland, which provide salary related benefits.
These differ from trust-based schemes in that their benefits and governance are prescribed by specific legislation, and they are administered by local authorities.
Typically, the Group has less control over the investment strategy adopted by the LGPS compared to the trust-based schemes.
Contribution rates are agreed for the three-year period until the next valuation.
The Group only recognises existing surpluses relating to theLGPSwhen determining the balance sheet position, to the extent that these surpluses could be recouped by the reduction of future companycontributions.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 34 Retirement benefit schemes continued North America US The Group operates two defined benefit arrangements in the US although benefit accrual ceased some years ago.
The plans are valued annually, when the funding position and minimum and maximum contributions are established.
Deficits are paid off as required by legislation.
Greyhound Canada There are three plans, relating to Eastern, Western and Supervisory employees.
All the plans are now closed to new members, although benefit accrual continues for existing members.
The plans are valued annually, when the cost of future service and the funding position are identified.
Future service costs are shared between themembers and the Company, with deficit contributions being met entirely by the Company.
Valuations At their last valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 74.4% and 105.4% 2016: 76.2% and 105.4%.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2017 for all non-rail operation defined benefit schemes totalled 3,123m 2016: 2,737m.
Rail The Railways Pension Scheme RPS The Group currently sponsors four sections of the RPS, relating to its franchising obligations for its TOCs, and for Hull Trains, its Open Accessoperator.
The RPS is governed by the Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited, and is subject to regulation from the Pensions Regulator and relevant UK legislation.
The RPS is a shared cost arrangement.
All costs, and any deficit or surplus, are shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the members.
For the TOC sections, under the franchising obligations, the employers responsibility is to pay the contributions requested by the Trustee, whilst itoperates the franchise.
There is no residual liability or asset for any deficit, or surplus, which remains at the end of the franchise period.
Since the contributions being paid to each TOC section are lower than the share of the service cost that would normally be calculated under IAS19, the Group does not make any contribution towards the sections deficits.
Therefore, the Group does not need to reflect any deficit on its balance sheet.
A franchise adjustment asset exists that exactly offsets any section deficit that would otherwise remain after reflecting the cost sharing with the members.
Valuation assumptions The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.

The net present value reflects the current value of deficit recovery payments that would be required to meet the actuarial deficit in full, discounted at 7.3% per annum.
Management consider that, were a pension asset to arise in respect of this scheme, this would be fully recoverable through actions within the Groups control, in line with the rules of the scheme.
The estimated amounts of employer contributions expected to be paid to the defined benefit schemes during the financial year to 31 March 2017 is 86.0m year to 31 March 2016: 94.8m.
Risks associated with defined benefit plans: Generally the number of employees in defined benefit plans is reducing rapidly, as these plans are largely closed to new entrants, and in many cases to future accrual.
Consequently, the number of defined contribution members is increasing.
The First UK Bus Pension Scheme will close to future accrual on 5 April 2018.
This change will serve to limit the risks associated with defined benefit pension provision by the Group.
Despite remaining open to new entrants and future accrual, the risks posed by the RPS are limited, as under the franchise arrangements, the First Rail TOCs are not responsible for any residual deficit at the end of a franchise.
As such, there is only short term cash flow risk within this business.
The key risks relating to the defined benefit pension arrangements and the steps taken by the Group to mitigate them are as follows: Risk Description Mitigation Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with Asset liability modelling has been undertaken to ensure that any reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform risks taken are expected to be rewarded.
thisyield, this will create a deficit.
Most of the defined benefit arrangements hold a significant proportion of return-seeking assets equities, diversified growth funds and global absolute return funds which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the UK benefit obligations are linked The business has certain inflation linking in its revenue streams to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
that helps to offset this risk.
In addition, the investment strategy reviews have led to increased inflation hedging, mainly through swaps or holding Index Linked Gilts in the UK schemes.
Uncertainty over Contributions to defined benefit schemes can be unpredictable The Group engages with the Trustees and Administering level of future and volatile as a result of changes in the funding level revealed Authorities to consider how contribution requirements can be contributions at each valuation.
The level of volatility and the Groups ability to control contribution levels varies between arrangements.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide Linking retirement age to State Pension Age as in The First benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life UKBus Pension Scheme and LGPS has mitigated this risk expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
