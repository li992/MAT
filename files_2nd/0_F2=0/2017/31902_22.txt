Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 111 Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 4.
Segmental information IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result, the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United Kingdom & Ireland.
There is no material difference between the segmentation of the Groups turnover by geographic origin and destination.
The Groups continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualified, professional and skilled recruitment.
Net fees and operating profit from continuing operations The Groups Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of revenue in internal reports, rather than use turnover.
This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers, and payments to other recruitment agencies where the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments.
The Groups Management Board considers net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources.
The Group does not report items below operating profit by segment in its internal management reporting.
The full detail of these items can be seen in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 104.
The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 5.

Goodwill In s million 2017 2016 Cost At 1 July 220.4 198.4 Exchange adjustments 2.9 22.0 At 30 June 223.3 220.4 Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows: Assumption How determined Operating profit The operating profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by the Groups Management Board which are compiled using expectations of fee growth, consultant productivity and operating costs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates.
Discount rates The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows range between 9.1% and 13.3% 2016: 9.3% and 16.7% reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the country risks specific to the relevant CGUs.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Groups operations is based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC, taking into account adjustments to the risk-free rate for 20-year bonds issued by the government in the respective market.
Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high-quality local corporate bond rates may be used.
These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities and, where appropriate, the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the increased return required over and above a risk-free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
Growth rates The medium-term growth rates are based on management forecasts.
These are consistent with a minimum average estimated growth rate of 5.0% 2016: 5.0%, with the exception of the United Kingdom where an average of 1.0% has been applied for years two to five and the United States where an average of 20.0% has been applied for years two to five following the completion of the initial investment phase in the business.
The growth estimates reflect acombination of both past experience and the macroeconomic environment, including GDP expectations driving fee growth.
The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate of between 2.0% to 3.5% 2016: 2.0%, reflecting a combination of GDP expectations and long-term wage inflation driving fee growth.
GDP growth is a key driver of our business, and is therefore a key consideration in developing long-term forecasts.
Wage inflation is also an important driver of net fees as net fees are derived directly from the salary level of candidates placed into employment.
Based on past experience a combination of these two factors is considered tobe an appropriate basis for assessing long-term growth rates.
Management has determined that there has been no impairment to any of the CGUs and in respect of these a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management.
This included a change in the pre-tax discount rate of up to 1% and changes in the long-term growth rate of between 0% and 2% in absolute terms.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise in isolation under each scenario for any of the CGUs with the exception of the Veredus business.
The Veredus business, which is part of the Continental Europe & Rest of World segment, was acquired in December 2014 and continues to perform in line with management expectations.
As a result the Group has continued to make significant investments in the business to accelerate its growth in line with the Groups strategy to build a strong presence in the USA, and maximise the long-term growth opportunities available in the market.
As a consequence of this investment, the headroom on goodwill based on the assumptions used in the goodwill calculation is 2.4 million arising on goodwill of 41.3 million.
The key assumptions in determining the value-in-use calculation are the pre-tax discount rate used which is 11.7%, the short-term growth rate which is 20% and the long-term growth rate which is 3.5%.
In isolation, an increase in the pre-tax discount rate by 1%, a reduction in the short-term growth rate by 3% or a reduction in the long-term growth rate by 1%, all in absolute terms and considered to be reasonably possible by management, would result in a small immaterial impairment of between 1.4 million to 2.7 million.
118 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Goodwill acquired in a business combination is considered its own CGU or allocated to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Individual CGUs are either country or brand specific.
For the purpose of disclosure individual CGUs have been aggregated and disclosed in accordance with segmental reporting.

Other deferred tax assets of 7.7 million 2016: 5.7 million arise in the other jurisdictions primarily Australia in which the Group operate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which they reverse.
The date enacted or substantively enacted for the relevant periods of reversal are: 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 in the UK 2016: 19% and 30% in Australia.

The average credit period taken is 39 days 2016: 37 days.
Accrued income primarily arises where temporary workers have provided their services but the amount incurred and margin earned thereon has yet to be invoiced onto the client due to timing.
The ageing analysis of the trade receivables not impaired is as follows: In s million 2017 2016 Not yet due 537.0 435.5 Up to one month past due 42.5 41.7 One to three months past due 6.6 9.7 586.1 486.9 The Groups exposure to foreign currency translation is primarily in respect of the Euro and the Australian Dollar.
The sensitivity of a 1 cent change in the year end closing exchange rates in respect of the Euro and Australian Dollar would result in a 2.5 million and 0.5 million movement in trade receivables respectively.
The movement on the provision for impairment of trade receivables is as follows: In s million 2017 2016 At 1 July 16.3 15.5 Exchange movement 0.5 1.3 Charge for the year 3.2 3.0 Uncollectable amounts written off 1.8 3.5 At 30 June 18.2 16.3 The ageing of impaired trade receivables relates primarily to trade receivables over three months past due.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group reduces risk through its credit control process and by contractual arrangements with other recruitment agencies in situations where the Group invoices on their behalf.
The Groups exposure is spread over a large number of customers.
The risk disclosures contained on pages 36 to 40 within the Strategic Report form part of these financial statements.

The average maturity of short-term deposits was one day 2016: one day.
Capital management The Boards priorities for free cash flow are to fund the Groups investment and development, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver a sustainable dividend at a level that is affordable and appropriate.
The Board targets a dividend cover range of 2.0x to 3.0x, full year earnings and remains committed to paying a sustainable and progressive dividend.
Further details including the Groups policy on uses of excess free cash flow and payment of special dividends can be found in the Financial Review on pages 34 to 35.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net cash debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts note 20 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Risk management A description of the Groups treasury policy and controls is included in the Financial Review on page 35.
Cash management and foreign exchange risk The Groups cash management policy is to minimise interest payments by closely managing Group cash balances and external borrowings.
Euro-denominated cash positions are managed centrally using a cash concentration arrangement which provides visibility over participating country bank balances on a daily basis.
Any Group surplus balance is used to repay any maturing loans under the Groups revolving credit facility or invested in overnight money market funds.
As the Group holds a sterling-denominated debt facility and generates significant foreign currency cash flows, the Board considers it appropriate in certain cases to use derivative financial instruments as part of its day-to-day cash management to reduce the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group had no cash pooling arrangements as at 30 June 2017.
As at 30 June 2016, 88 million of overdraft balances were offset against 88 million of cash balances under the European cash pool facility that existed at that date and which the Group had legal set-off.
The Groups operating profit exposure to foreign currency translation is primarily in respect of the Euro and the Australian Dollar.
The sensitivity of a 1 cent change in the average exchange rates for the year in respect of the Euro and Australian Dollar would result in a 1.1 million and 0.4 million change in operating profit respectively.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and income statement translation exposure.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
It is the Groups policy to limit its exposure to fluctuating interest rates by selectively hedging interest rate risk using derivative financial instruments, however there were no interest rate swaps held by the Group during the current or prior year.
Cash and cash equivalents carry interest at floating rates based on local money market rates.
Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk arises primarily from the investment of surplus funds.
Risks are closely monitored using credit ratings assigned to financial institutions by international credit rating agencies.
The Group restricts transactions to banks and money market funds that have an acceptable credit profile and limits its exposure to each institution accordingly.
Derivative financial instruments As at 30 June 2017, the Group had entered into four forward exchange contracts arrangements with counterparty banks: In s million 2017 2016 Net derivative asset 6.6 As set out in note 18 and in the Treasury management section of the Financial Review on page 35, in certain cases the Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its foreign exchange exposures as part of its day-to-day cash management.
As at 30 June 2017, the Group had entered into four forward exchange contract arrangements with counterparty banks 2016: eight forward contracts.
The fair market value of the contracts as at 30 June 2017 gave rise to an immaterial unrealised gain resulting in the presentation of anet derivative asset of nil 2016: 6.6 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Some of the derivative assets and liabilities meet the offsetting criteria of IAS 32 paragraph 42.
Consequently, the qualifying gross derivative liabilities are set off against the qualifying gross derivative assets.
The derivative liabilities not qualifying for offset is less than the rounding factor presented in the financial statements and thus presented as nil 2016: nil.

Committed facilities The Group has a 210 million unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in April 2020.
The financial covenants require the Groups interest cover ratio to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA to be no greater than 2.5:1.
The interest rate of the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 0.90% to 1.55%.
At 30 June 2017, 210 million of the committed facility was undrawn.
Maturities of bank loans and overdrafts The maturity of borrowings are as follows: In s million 2017 2016 Within one year 0.4 1.1 More than one year 25.0 0.4 26.1 Fair values of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts The fair value of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts is not materially different to their book value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments, which are based on floating rates.
The interest rate profile of bank loans and overdrafts is as follows: In s million 2017 2016 Floating rate sterling 0.4 26.1 The floating rate liabilities comprise bank loans and unsecured overdrafts bearing interest at rates based on local market rates.

The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 32 days 2016: 29 days.
Accruals primarily relate to the remuneration costs for temporary workers and other agencies that have provided their services but remuneration has yet to be made due to timing.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes in the UK and in other countries.
The Groups principal schemes are within the UKwhere the Group operates one defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in relation to these overseas arrangements was 8.1 million 2016: 7.7 million.
UK Defined Contribution Scheme The Groups principal defined contribution retirement benefit scheme is the Hays Group Personal Pension Plan which is operated for all qualifying employees and is funded via an employee salary sacrifice arrangement, and for qualifying employees additional employer contributions.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 12% of pensionable salary depending on the level of employee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 6.5 million 2016: 6.2 million represents employers contributions payable to the money purchase arrangements.
There were no contributions outstanding at the end of the current year or prior year.
The assets of the money purchase arrangements are held separately from those of the Group.
UK Defined Benefit Schemes The Groups principal defined benefit schemes are the Hays Pension Scheme and the Hays Supplementary Scheme both in the UK.
The Hays Pension Scheme is a funded final salary defined benefit scheme providing pensions and death benefits to members.
The Hays Supplementary Scheme is an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The Schemes were closed to future accrual from 30 June 2012 with pensions calculated up until the point of closure.
The Schemes are governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Group and is subject to full actuarial valuation on a triennial basis.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2015 and quantified the deficit at c. 95 million.
Arevised deficit funding schedule was agreed with effect from 1 July 2015 which maintained the annual contribution at its previous level, subject to a 3% per annum fixed uplift over a period of just under 10 years.
During the year ended 30 June 2017, the Group made a contribution of 14.4 million to the Hays Pension Scheme 2016: 14.0 million in accordance with the agreed deficit funding schedule.
The cash contributions during the year mainly related to deficit funding payments.
In respect of IFRIC 14, The Hays Pension Scheme Definitive Deed and Rules is considered to provide Hays with an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets and therefore the recognition of a net defined benefit scheme asset is not restricted and agreements to make funding contributions do not give rise to any additional liabilities in respect of the scheme.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity-specific or scheme-specific risks.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The net amount included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of its defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: In s million 2017 2016 Present value of defined benefit obligations 784.9 726.3 Less fair value of defined benefit scheme assets: Equities 119.3 132.3 Bonds and gilts 320.9 293.3 Absolute return funds 46.7 36.6 LDI funds 237.0 224.7 Real estate 48.6 22.7 Cash 12.2 2.4 Total fair value of defined benefit scheme assets 784.7 712.0 Net liability arising from defined benefit obligation 0.2 14.3 In s million Quoted Unquoted Total Asset category Equities 110.9 8.4 119.3 Bonds and gilts 138.0 182.9 320.9 Absolute return funds 46.7 46.7 LDI funds 932.3 695.3 237.0 Real estate 3.0 45.6 48.6 Cash 12.2 12.2 Total scheme assets 1,243.1 458.4 784.7 The trustee board is responsible for determining the Hays pension schemes investment strategy, after taking advice from the Schemes investment advisor Mercer Limited.
The investment objective for the trustee of the Scheme is to maintain a portfolio of suitable assets of appropriate liquidity which will generate investment returns to meet, together with future contributions, the benefits of the defined benefit scheme as they fall due.
The current strategy is to hold investments that share characteristics with the long-term liabilities of the Scheme.
Themajority of assets are invested in equities, corporate bonds and a Liability Driven Investment LDI portfolio.
The Scheme assets do not include any directly held shares issued by the Company or property occupied by the Company.
The fair value of financial instruments has been determined using the fair value hierarchy.
Where such quoted prices are unavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset, adjusted if necessary, is used.
Where quoted prices are not available and recent transactions of anidentical asset on their own are either unavailable or not a good estimate of fair value, valuation techniques are employed using observable market data and non-observable data.
In relation to the LDI funds the valuations have been determined as follows: Repurchase agreements where the Scheme has sold assets with the agreement to repurchase at a fixed date and price are included in the financial statements at the fair value of the repurchase price as a liability.
The assets sold are reported at their fair value reflecting that the Scheme retains the risks and rewards of ownership of those assets.
The fair value of the forward currency contracts is based on market forward exchange rates at the year end and determined as the gain or loss that would arise if the outstanding contract was matched at the year end with an equal and opposite contract.
Swaps represent current value of future cash flows arising from the swap, determined using discounted cash flow models and market data atthe reporting date.
126 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information The analysis of the LDI funds included within the pension scheme assets is as follows: In s million Quoted Unquoted Total LDI funds summary valuation Corporate bonds 7.2 7.2 Government bonds 478.6 478.6 Government index linked 435.4 435.4 Interest rate swaps 62.8 62.8 Fixed incomes futures 24.6 24.6 Liquidity 11.1 11.1 Gross funds 932.3 87.4 1,019.7 Repurchase agreements 634.3 634.3 Asset swaps 103.3 103.3 RPI swaps 20.5 20.5 Futures 24.6 24.6 Gross liabilities 782.7 782.7 Total LDI funds 932.3 695.3 237.0 The LDI portfolio is managed by Insight a Bank of New York Mellon company under an active mandate and uses government bonds and derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, inflation swaps and gilt repurchase transactions to hedge the impact of interest rate and inflation movements in relation to the long-term liabilities.
Under the Schemes LDI strategy, if interest rates fall, the value of LDI investments will rise to help match the increase in actuarial liabilities arising from the fall in discount rate.
Similarly if interest rates rise, the LDI investments will fall in value, as will the liabilities because of the increase in the discount rate.
The extent to which the liability interest rate and inflation risk is not fully matched by the LDI funds represents the residual interest rate and inflation risk the Scheme remains exposed to.
In addition to the above risk, the LDI portfolio forms part of a diversified investment portfolio for the Scheme, with this diversification seeking to reduce investment risk.
The Scheme is subject to direct credit risk because the Scheme invests in segregated mandates with the Insight LDI portfolio.
Credit risk arising on bonds held directly within the LDI portfolio is mitigated by investing mostly in government bonds where the credit risk is minimal.
Credit risk arising on the derivatives held in the LDI mandate depends on whether the derivative is exchange traded or over the counter OTC.
OTC derivative contracts are not guaranteed by any regulated exchange and therefore the Scheme is subject to risk of failure of the counterparty.
The credit risk for OTC swaps held in the LDI portfolio is reduced by collateral arrangements.

The amount of deficit funding contributions expected to be paid into the funded Hays Pension scheme in the year to 30 June 2018 is 14.8 million.
Following the closure of the Schemes in 2012 future service contributions are no longer payable.
The net expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement comprised: In s million 2017 2016 Net interest expense 0.2 2.0 Administration costs 2.2 1.9 Effect of settlement 1.6 Net expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 2.4 5.5 The net interest expense and administration costs in the current year and prior year were recognised within finance costs.

The key assumptions used at 30 June 2017 are listed below.
2017 2016 Discount rate 2.7% 2.8% RPI inflation 3.3% 2.8% CPI inflation 2.3% 1.8% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.2% 2.8% Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.3% 1.8% The discount rate has been constructed to reference the Hymans Robertson AA corporate bond curve which fits a curve to iBoxx AA corporate data.
The corporate bond yield curve has been used to discount the Scheme cash flows using the rates available at each future duration and this had been converted into a single flat rate assumption to give equivalent liabilities to the Schemes cash flows.
The duration of the Schemes liabilities using this approach is circa 22 years.
The RPI inflation assumption has been set as gilt market implied RPI appropriate to the duration of the liabilities circa 22 years less a 0.2% per annum inflation risk premium.
The CPI inflation assumption has been determined as 1% per annum below the RPI assumption.
This approach for both RPI and CPI assumptions is consistent with last year.
128 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information The life expectancy assumptions have been calculated using Club Vita base tables and future improvements in line with the CMI 2013 model with a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% per annum and non peaked short-term future improvements.
On this basis a 65-year-old current pensioner has a life expectancy of 24.5 years for males 2016: 24.3 years and 25.0 years for females 2016: 24.8 years.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the Schemes liabilities at the year end is: Change in Impact on assumption Schemes Discount rate 0.5% 97m RPI inflation 0.5% 57m Pension increase sensitivity 0.5% 40m Assumed life expectancy at age 60 rate of mortality 1 Year 31m The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation to one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Performance Share Plan PSP and Deferred Annual Bonus DAB The PSP is designed to link reward to the key long-term value drivers of the business and to align the interests of the executive directors and approximately 320 of the global senior management population with the long-term interests of shareholders.
PSP awards are discretionary and vesting is dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over either a three-year period or a one-year period with a two-year holding period.
Only the executive directors and other members of the Management Board participate in the DAB which promotes a stronger link between short-term and long-term performance through the deferral of annual bonuses into shares for a three-year period.
Further details of the schemes for the executive directors can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 66.

The business was acquired for a total cash consideration of 36.1 million and to reflect the substance of the transaction using the principles of IFRS 10, the acquisition was accounted for as if 100% of the equity had been acquired.
The deferred consideration is subject to a put call arrangement which provides Hays with an option to acquire the remaining 20% of the equity from the shareholders.
The option is first available for exercise in March 2018.
On 17 January 2017 there was an amendment to the arrangement that fixed the purchase price for the remaining 20% of the equity from shareholders at $18.5 million.
This has resulted in an additional charge of 1.1 million being recognised in the income statement during the year.
The unwind of the discount in the year of 1.1 million is recognised as a finance cost in the income statement.
A liability of 11.2 million was recognised in the prior year representing managements best estimate of the amount payable, discounted to its present value.
Subsequent events The final dividend for 2017 of 2.26 pence per share 32.8 million together with a special dividend of 4.25 pence per share 61.6 million will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 15 November 2017 and has not been included as a liability as at 30 June 2017.
If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 17 November 2017 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 6 October 2017.
