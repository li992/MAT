Operating segments In December 2016 Syncona Limited formerly BACIT Limited acquired Syncona Partners LLP.
The resulting Group is made up of two main components, the life science portfolio and funds portfolio.
The Board has considered the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, and is of the view that the Groups activities form two segments under the standard, the life science portfolio and the funds portfolio.
The funds portfolio and life science portfolio are managed on a global basis and accordingly, no geographical disclosures areprovided.
The Board, as a whole, has been determined as constituting the chief decision maker of the Group.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Groups performance and to allocate resources is the total return based on the NAV per share, as calculated under IFRS.
Life science portfolio The substantial majority of the assets in the life science portfolio was acquired during the December 2016 transaction.
The underlying investments in this segment are those whose activities focus on actively developing products to deliver transformational treatments for patients.
Details of the underlying assets are shown in the Portfolio Statement on page 74.
Funds portfolio The underlying assets in this segment are investments in a diversified portfolio of hedge, equity and long-term alternative investment funds across multiple asset classes.
Details of the underlying assets are shown in the Portfolio Statement on pages 74 and 75.

In the prior year the Groups activities formed a single segment, namely the funds portfolio.
Following the December 2016 transaction, the reporting segments have changed so the 2016 segments have been restated.
The difference in the restatement relates to the CRT Pioneer Fund which was previously treated as a Fund Investment and deemed immaterial for disclosure.
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the CRT Pioneer Fund is included in the life science portfolio as the underlying assets are developing products to deliver transformational treatments for patients.
