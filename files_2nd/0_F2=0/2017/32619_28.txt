Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 17 Notes to the Group financial statements 52 weeks ended 29 January 2017 1 Performance in the period 1.1 Accounting policies Revenue recognition Sale of goods in-store and online, and fuel Revenue from the sale of goods in-store and online comprises cash from customers and excludes VAT.
It is net of returns, colleague discounts, coupons, vouchers, More points earned in-store and online, and the free element of multi-save transactions.
Sale of fuel is recognised net of VAT and More points earned on fuel.
Revenue is recognised when transactions are completed in-store, or, in the case of food online, when goods are accepted by the customer on delivery.
Other sales Other sales includes income from concessions and commissions based on the terms of the contract, and sales made direct to third party customers recognised on despatch of goods.
Revenue collected on behalf of others is not recognised as revenue, other than the related commission.
Sales are recorded net of VAT and intra-group transactions.
More points The fair value of More points is determined to be the value to the customer of the points issued, adjusted for factors such as the expected redemption rate.
The Group continues to assess the appropriateness of the expected redemption rates against actual redemptions.
The fair value is treated as a deduction from revenue at the time the points are issued, and is deferred until the rewards are redeemed by the customer in a future sale.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of all costs of the goods being sold to the point of sale, net of promotional funding and commercial income, and includes property, manufacturing, warehouse and transportation costs.
Store depreciation, store overheads and store-based employee costs are also allocated to cost of sales.
Promotional funding Promotional funding refers to investment in the customer offer by suppliers by way of promotion.
The calculation of funding is mechanical and system generated based on a funding level agreed in advance with the supplier.
Funding is recognised as units are sold and invoiced in accordance with the specific supplier agreement.
Funding is recorded effectively as a direct adjustment to the cost price of the product in the period.
Funding is invoiced and collected through the year, shortly after the promotions have ended.
Commercial income Commercial income is recognised as a deduction from cost of sales, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract.
The Group only recognises commercial income where there is documented evidence of an agreement with an individual supplier and when associated performance conditions are met.
The types of commercial income recognised by the Group, and the recognition policies are: Type of commercial income Description Recognition Marketing and Examples include income in respect Income is recognised over the period as set out in the specific supplier agreement.
advertising funding of in-store marketing and point of Income is invoiced once the performance conditions in the supplier agreement sale, as well as funding for advertising.
Volume-based rebates Income earned by achieving volume Income is recognised through the year based on forecasts for expected sales or or spend targets set by the supplier for purchase volumes, informed by current performance, trends, and the terms of the specific products over specific periods.
Income is invoiced throughout the year in accordance with the specific supplier terms.
In order to minimise any risk arising from estimation, supplier confirmations are also obtained to agree the final value to be recognised at year end, prior to it being invoiced.
Uncollected commercial income at the balance sheet date is classified within the financial statements as follows: Creditors: A large proportion of the Groups trading terms state that income due from suppliers is netted against amounts owing to that supplier.
Any outstanding invoiced commercial income relating to these suppliers at the balance sheet date are included within trade payables.
Any amounts received in advance of income being recognised are included in accruals and deferred income.
Debtors: Where the trading terms described above do not exist, the Group classifies outstanding commercial income within trade debtors.
Where commercial income is earned and not invoiced to the supplier at the balance sheet date, this is classified within accrued commercial income.
Stock: The carrying value of stock is adjusted to reflect unearned elements of commercial income as the stock has not yet been sold.
This income is subsequently recognised in cost of sales when the product has been sold.

The Group is not reliant on any major customer for 1% or more of revenues.
The Group is required to determine and present its operating segments based on the way in which financial information is organised and reported to the chief operating decision-maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the Executive Committee as this makes the key operating decisions of the Group and is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance.
Key internal reports received by the CODM, primarily the management accounts, focus on the performance of the Group as a whole.
The operations of all elements of the business are driven by the retail sales environment and hence have fundamentally the same economic characteristics.
All operational decisions made are focused on the performance and growth of the retail outlets and the ability of the business to meet the supply demands of the stores.
The Group has considered the overriding core principles of IFRS 8 Operating segments as well as its internal reporting framework, management and operating structure.
In particular, the Group considered its retail outlets, the fuel sale operation, the manufacturing entities and online operations.
The Directors conclusion is that the Group has one operating segment, that of retailing.
Reconciliations of reportable segment revenues, profit or loss, assets and liabilities and other material items Performance is measured by the CODM based on underlying profit before tax as reported in the management accounts.
Management believes that this underlying profit measure is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the Group.
This information and the reconciliation to the statutory position can be found in note 1.4.
In addition, the management accounts present a Group balance sheet containing assets and liabilities.
