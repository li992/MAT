Alternative performance measures Introduction We assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the groups results on an adjusted basis.
The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained below.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before specific items.
Certain comparatives have been revised, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
We also explain financial performance using measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures.
Thenon-GAAP measures we use are: the trend in underlying revenue excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE, and in underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE, as well as in EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE: normalised free cash flow: and net debt.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specific items The groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specific items.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups financial performance, as specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
This presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Operating Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and or prior years include acquisitions disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory settlements, historical insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years.
In the event that other items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are also treated as specific items.
Specific items are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Trends in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE Underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE are measures which seek to reflect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to long-term sustainable profitable growth.
Assuch they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specific items.
We exclude transit from the trends as transit traffic is low-margin and isaffected by reductions in mobile termination rates.
Given the significance of the EE acquisition to the group, in 2016 17 we are calculating underlying revenue excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE and underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE, as though EE had been part of the group from 1 April 2015.
This is different from how we usually adjust for acquisitions.
A reconciliation from the increase in reported revenue and in reported operating costs, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the movement in underlying revenue and increase in underlying operating costs excluding transit adjusted for the acquisition of EE, are set out below.

252 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 253 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION EBITDA In addition to measuring financial performance of the group and lines of business based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE.
EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before specific items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
We consider EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
Trends in underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE is a measure which seeks to reflect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to long-term sustainable profitable growth.
As such they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specific items.
Given the significance of the EE acquisition to the group in 2016 17 we are calculating underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE, as though EE had been part of the group from 1 April 2015.
A reconciliation from group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to group EBITDA and adjusted group EBITDA and a reconciliation of the trends in EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE is provided below.
Areconciliation between operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for our lines of business is set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Earnings per share We also measure financial performance based on adjusted earnings per share, which excludes specific items.
Basic and adjusted earnings per share, and the per share impact of specific items, are as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Pence Pence Pence Year ended 31 March per share m per share m per share m a Basic earnings per share profit 19.2 1,908 28.5 2,466 25.5 2,057 b Specific items 9.7 961 3.3 278 5.1 406 Adjusted basic earnings per share profit 28.9 2,869 31.8 2,744 30.6 2,463 a The stated profit is the component of total profit which is attributable to equity shareholders excluding non-controlling interests.

252 BT Group plc Annual Report 2017 Annual Report 2017 BT Group plc 253 Alternative performance measures continued Free cash flow Normalised free cash flow is one of the groups key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured.
Normalised free cash flow is defined as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents less: cash flows from financing activities except net interest paid, the acquisition or disposal of group undertakings and the net sale of short-term investments and excluding: the cash impact of specific items, purchases oftelecommunications licences, and the cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments.
For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis.
Normalised free cash flow is primarily a liquidity measure.
However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reflects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and financing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outflows associated with investing in our infrastructure and financing our operations.
In addition, normalised free cash flow excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals, and repayment and raising of debt.
Normalised free cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.
A reconciliation from net cash inflow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to free cash flow and normalised free cash flow, is set out below.
2017 2016 2015 Year ended 31 March m m m Net cash inflow from operating activities 6,174 5,151 4,788 Add back pension deficit payments 274 880 876 Included in cash flows from investing activities Net capital expenditure 3,119 2,431 2,310 Interest received 7 10 10 Net purchases sales of non-current asset investments and dividends received from associates and joint ventures 20 17 8 Included in cash flows from financing activities Interest paid 629 558 590 Free cash flow 2,687 3,069 2,782 Net cash outflow from specific items 205 232 154 Cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments 110 203 106 Normalised free cash flow 2,782 3,098 2,830 Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured as the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Our net debt calculation starts from the expected future undiscounted cash flows that should arise when our financial instruments mature.
We adjust these cash flows to reflect hedged risks that are re-measured under fair value hedges, as well as for the impact of the effective interest method.
Currency-denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swap rates where hedged.
Net debt is a measure of the groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the groups cash position and its indebtedness.
The use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not defined in IFRS.
A reconciliation from loans and other borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset investments, the most directly comparable IFRS measures to net debt, is set out below.
