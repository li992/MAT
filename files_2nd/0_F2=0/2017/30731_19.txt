Revenue The Groups primary source of revenue is fee income from investment management activities performed within both the Asset Management and Wealth Management segments.
Fee income includes management fees, performance fees and other income.
Revenue also includes interest income earned within the Wealth Management segment.
Management fees are generated through investment management agreements and are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of AUM.
Management fees are recognised as the service is provided and it is probable that the fee will be received.
Performance fees are earned from some arrangements when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance measurement periods.
They are only recognised at the end of these performance periods, when a reliable estimate of the fee can be made and it is almost certain that the fee will be received.
Other income principally comprises revenues for other services which are typically driven by levels of AUM, along with revenues which vary according to the volume of transactions.
Other income is recorded as the relevant services are provided and the receipt of income is almost certain.
Within Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity.
Interest income earned as a result of placing loans and deposits with other financial institutions, advancing loans and overdrafts to clients and holding debt and other fixed income securities is recognised within revenue.
Interest income is recognised as it is earned using the effective interest method, which allocates interest at a constant rate of return over the expected life of the financial instrument based on the estimated future cash flows.
Revenue comprises: 2017 2016 m m Management fees 2,155.6 1,848.3 Performance fees 78.4 41.2 Other income 245.4 223.8 Wealth Management interest income earned 32.3 31.6 2,511.7 2,144.9 3.
Cost of sales Fee expenses incurred by the Group that vary in proportion to the relevant AUM are presented as cost of sales.
These expenses include commissions, external fund manager fees and distribution fees payable to financial institutions, investment platform providers and financial advisers that distribute the Groups products.
Fee expense is generally based on an agreed percentage of the value of the investments placed with the Group and is recognised in the income statement as the service is received.
Wealth Management pays interest to clients on deposits taken.
For Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity.
Interest payable in respect of these activities is therefore recorded separately from interest payable elsewhere in the business and is reported as part of cost of sales.
Interest payable is recognised using the effective interest method see note 2.
Cost of sales comprises: 2017 2016 m m Fee expense 490.6 421.1 Wealth Management interest expense incurred 10.9 11.0 501.5 432.1 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 103 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 4.
Net gains on financial instruments and other income The Group holds financial instruments to support its Group capital strategies which comprise operating capital, seed and co-investment capital and other investible equity.
Operating capital is retained in the Groups operating entities to meet minimum local regulatory capital requirements and other capital required for day-to-day operational purposes.
Operating capital principally comprises cash and cash equivalents and other low-risk financial instruments as well as financial instruments held to hedge fair value movements on certain deferred fund awards.
Seed and co-investment capital represents strategic investments in the Groups products to develop new investment strategies, co-invest selectively alongside clients and finance growth initiatives.
Seed and co-investment capital is financed from investment capital and, where practical, the market risk on seed capital investments is hedged.
Investible equity held in excess of operating requirements is transferred to investment capital which is managed centrally in accordance with limits approved by the Board.
A portion of the Groups financial instruments held at fair value are carried at fair value through profit or loss FVP.
FVP financial instruments are those that are initially designated as such and those that are held for regular trading.
Netgains and losses on FVP financial instruments principally comprise market returns on investments in debt securities, equities, pooled investment vehicles and any gains and losses on derivatives which mainly arise from hedging activities.
Net gains and losses on certain FVP financial instruments held to hedge deferred employee cash awards are presented separately and are included within operating expenses see note 5.
This presentation better reflects the substance of these transactions and provides more relevant information about the Groups net income and operating expenses.
The remainder of the Groups investments held at fair value are classified as available-for-sale AFS.
This classification is typically selected when the investment is expected to be held for the long term but not necessarily to maturity and where short-term volatility does not reflect long-term expected returns.
Generally, unrealised gains and losses on AFS investments are recorded in other comprehensive income, but the cumulative gains and losses are transferred to the income statement if the investment is impaired, sold or otherwise realised.
The fair value reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the difference between the cost or, if the asset has been reclassified or impaired, the fair value at the date of reclassification or impairment and the fair value of financial assets that are classified as AFS.
Any impairments of loans and receivables are also included in the income statement.
The Group reviews its AFS investments and loans and receivables for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
Net finance income is derived from interest on non-banking activities, principally generated from cash and deposits with banks, but also as a result of holding investments in debt securities.
Debt securities and cash held outside of Wealth Management entities are managed mainly by Group Treasury to earn competitive rates of return and provide liquidity throughout the Group.
Significant amounts of the Groups cash and interest-earning securities are held within Wealth Management and are managed by the Wealth Management treasury team.
Interest earned on the assets held within Wealth Management is included in revenue: interest incurred on the liabilities assumed is included in cost of sales.
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method see note 2.
Other income includes amounts arising from assets under administration within Benchmark Capital, gains and losses on foreign exchange and rent receivable from subletting properties.

Operating expenses Operating expenses represent the Groups administrative expenses and are recognised as the services are provided.
Certain costs, including leases and capitalised costs, are charged evenly over the life of the relevant contract or useful life of the asset.
The biggest component of the Groups operating expenses is employee benefits, as shown below.
Other costs include accommodation, information technology, marketing and outsourcing costs.
The control of total costs, including compensation costs, is a key performance objective of the Group.
Compensation costs are managed toatarget total compensation ratio of between 45% to 49%.
Targeting a total compensation ratio range provides some flexibility to manage the overall cost base in response to market conditions.
Total costs are managed to a target long-term KPI ratio of total costs to net income of65%.
Employee benefits expense includes salaries and wages, together with the cost of other benefits provided to employees such as pension andbonuses.
Employee benefits expense is presented net of gains and losses on financial instruments held to hedge deferred employee cash awards see note 4.
The Group makes some performance awards to employees which are deferred over a specified vesting period.
Such awards are charged to the income statement over the performance period and the vesting period.
The Group holds investments that are linked to these performance awards in order to hedge the related expense.
Gains and losses on these investments are netted against the relevant costs in the income statement but are presented separately below.
Further detail on other types of employee benefit can be found elsewhere within these financial statements: see note 25 for pension costs, and note 26 for more detail on compensation that is awarded in Schroders plc shares.

Tax expense continued Estimates and judgements The calculation of the Groups tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
Liabilities relating to open and judgemental matters, including those in relation to deferred taxes, are based on the Groups assessment of the most likely outcome based on the information available.
The Group engages constructively and transparently with tax authorities with a view to early resolution of any uncertain tax matters.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts provided, such differences will impact the tax charge in a future period and the tax charge includes an estimate reflecting the potential additional liability, if any.
Such estimates are based on assumptions made on the probability of potential challenge within certain jurisdictions and the possible outcome based on interpretation and local tax laws.
Amounts recorded within the 2017 tax charge related to these judgements were not material 2016: same.
Earnings per share This key performance indicator shows the portion of the Groups profit after tax that is attributable to each share excluding own shares held by the Group.
The calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The diluted figure recalculates that number as if all share options that would be expected to be exercised, as they have value to the option holder, had been exercised in the period.
Shares that may be issued are not taken into account if the impact does not reduce earnings per share.
Reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share: 2017 2016 Number Number Millions Millions Weighted average number of shares used in calculation of basic earnings per share 275.4 274.7 Effect of dilutive potential shares share options 5.6 5.6 Effect of dilutive potential shares contingently issuable shares 0.1 0.2 Weighted average number of shares used in calculation of diluted earnings per share 281.1 280.5 The pre-exceptional earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax excluding non-controlling interest of 3.7 million 2016:0.5million.
After exceptional items, the profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interest was 1.4 million 2016: 0.5 million.
Dividends Dividends are distributions of profit to holders of the Groups share capital, usually announced with the Groups half-year and annual results.
Dividends are recognised only when they are paid or approved by shareholders.
The reduction in equity in the year therefore comprises the prior year final dividend and the current year interim dividend.

The Board has recommended a 2017 final dividend of 79.0 pence per share 2016 final dividend: 64.0 pence, amounting to 216.0 million 2016 final dividend: 174.7 million.
The dividend will be paid on 3 May 2018 to shareholders on the register at 23 March 2018 and will be accounted for in 2018.
In addition, the Group paid 3.5 million of dividends to holders of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries of the Group during 2017 2016: nil, resulting in total dividends paid of 271.1 million 2016: 236.6 million.

Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables includes prepayments and deposits with banks in the form of bullion as well as amounts the Group is due to receive from third parties in the normal course of business.
Trade and other receivables, other than deposits with banks in the form of bullion which are recorded at fair value, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost see note 10, after the deduction of provisions for any impairment.
Prepayments arise where the Group pays cash in advance for services.
As the service is provided, the prepayment is reduced and the operating expense recognised in the income statement.
Amounts due from third parties include fees yet to be received as well as settlement accounts for transactions undertaken on behalf of funds and investors.
Includes receivables arising from the acquisition of Adveq Holding AG see note 29.
The fair value of trade and other receivables held at amortised cost approximates to their carrying value.
Deposits with banks in the form of bullion are categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy see note 10.
Financial assets The Group holds financial assets including equities, debt securities, pooled investment vehicles and derivatives to support its Group capital strategies and its Wealth Management book along with client loans.
The Group also enters into derivatives on behalf of Wealth Management clients, referred to as client facilitation see note 20.
The Group initially records all financial assets at fair value, which is normally the cost of acquiring the asset or, in the case of loans, the amount loaned to clients.
The Group holds each financial asset either at fair value fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale or at amortised cost held to maturity and loans and receivables.
Fair value is explained on page 109.
Amortised cost is the basis of moving the initial value at which the financial instrument is recognised to the maturity value on a systematic basis using a fixed interest rate effective interest rate, taking account of repayment dates and initial premiums or discounts.
The carrying value of amortised cost financial instruments is adjusted for impairments.
Impairment is normally determined based on an assessment of the estimated future cash flows on a discounted basis using the original effective interest rate compared with contractual amounts.
Hedge accounting Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, the Group designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
In these scenarios, and where relevant conditions are met, hedge accounting is applied and the Group formally documents the relationship between the derivative and any hedged item, its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the various hedging transactions.
It also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items.
For fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement whereas, for an available-for-sale asset, it would otherwise have been recorded in other comprehensive income.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the instrument is derecognised.
In respect of hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised directly in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.

Estimates and judgements fair value measurements The Group holds financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The fair value of financial instruments may require some estimation or may be derived from readily available sources.
The degree of estimation involved is reflected below, although this does not necessarily indicate that the fair value is more or less likely to be realised.
For investments that are actively traded in financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to official quoted market prices.
For investments that are not actively traded, fair value is determined by using quoted prices from third parties such as brokers, market makers and pricing agencies.
Financial assets that have no quoted price principally consist of investments in private equity funds, derivatives and client loans in Wealth Management.
The determination of fair value for these instruments requires significant estimation, particularly in determining whether changes in fair value have occurred since the last formal valuation.
The Groups financial instruments have been categorised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the extent of judgements used in the valuation.
These judgements may include determining which valuation approach to apply as well as determining appropriate assumptions.
For level 2 and 3 investments, the judgement applied by the Group gives rise to an estimate of fair value.
The fair value estimate of level 2 and 3 investments are set out below, with no individual input giving rise to a material component of the carrying value for the Group.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and principally comprise investments in quoted equities and government debt, daily-priced funds and exchange-traded derivatives: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from prices that are not traded in an active market but are determined using valuation techniques, which make maximum use of observable market data.
The Groups level 2 financial instruments principally comprise foreign exchange contracts, certain debt securities, asset and mortgage backed securities, and loans held at fair value.
Valuation techniques may include using a broker quote in an inactive market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of primarily observable market information utilising information readily available via external sources.
For funds not priced on a daily basis, the net asset value which is issued monthly or quarterly is used: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data and principally comprise investments in private equity funds.
These are measured by applying appropriate valuation techniques in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
The valuation review is a continual process throughout the year.
Estimates and judgements impairment of financial assets The Groups financial assets categorised as available-for-sale are assessed for impairment by considering the extent to which the fair value of an investment is below cost and to the length of time that the fair value of an instrument has been below cost.
In determining whether financial assets are impaired, the Group applies judgement to determine whether there are any indicators that counterparties are experiencing financial difficulty or that the fair value is otherwise unlikely to recover in the long term.
The Group monitors its Wealth Management loans on a daily basis and exercises judgement periodically in determining whether a loan should be impaired.
This includes, amongst other steps, assessing the financial condition of the borrower and the value of the loan compared to the collateral pledged by the borrower.
There were no material judgements with respect to impairment of financial assets made in 2017 2016: same.

Associates and joint ventures Associates are entities in which the Group has an investment and over which it has significant influence, but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions.
Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has an investment where it, along with one or more other shareholders, has contractually agreed to share control of the business and where the major decisions require the unanimous consent of the joint partners.
In both cases, the Groups income statement reflects its share of the entitys profit or loss after tax and amortisation of intangible assets, the statement of other comprehensive income records the Groups share of gains and losses arising from the entitys available-for-sale financial assets, the statement of financial position records the Groups share of the net assets of the entity plus any goodwill and intangible assets that arose on purchase less subsequent amortisation and the statement of changes in equity records the Groups share of other equity movements of the entity.
Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed regularly for impairment.
The associates and joint ventures reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the Groups share of profits in its investments yet to be received for example, in the form of dividends or distributions, less any amortisation of intangible assets.
Certain associates are held at fair value where permitted by IAS 28.

Property, plant and equipment The Groups property, plant and equipment provide the infrastructure to enable the Group to operate and principally comprise leasehold improvements, freehold land and buildings and computer equipment.
Assets are initially stated at cost, which includes expenditure associated with acquisition.
The cost of the asset is recognised in the income statement as a depreciation charge on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life, with the exception of land as it is assumed to have an indefinite useful life.
Goodwill and intangible assets Intangible assets other than software arise when the Group acquires a business and the fair value paid exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired.
This premium reflects additional value that the Group determines to be attached to the business.
Identifiable acquired intangible assets relating to business combinations include technology, contractual agreements to manage client funds and gain additional access to new or existing clients, geographies and brand names.
Where such assets can be identified, they are classified as acquired intangible assets and charged to the income statement over time.
Consideration paid to acquire the business in excess of the acquisition date fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is known as goodwill.
Goodwill is not charged to the income statement unless its value has diminished.
Assessment of whether goodwill has become impaired is based on the expected future returns of the relevant cash-generating unit CGU as a whole.
Software purchased and developed for use in the business is also classified as an intangible asset.
The cost of purchasing and developing software is taken to the income statement over time as an amortisation charge within operating expenses.
The treatment is similar to property, plant and equipment and the asset is normally amortised on a straight line basis over three to five years, but can have estimated useful lives of up to 10 years.
The Group acquired 64.3 million 2016: 44.0 million of intangible assets as a result of business combinations completed in 2017, 33.9 million of which related to the acquisition of Adveq Holding AG in the Asset Management segment and 26.5 million of which related to the acquisition of the wealth management business of C. Hoare & Co. A further 3.9 million was added to the Wealth Management segment from other completed acquisitions see note 29.
Estimates and judgements The Group estimates the fair value of acquired intangible assets based on estimated profits, taking account of synergies, derived from contractual relationships that existed at the acquisition date.
This assessment involved assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount rates and the expected duration of client relationships.
The Group also made estimates to determine the fair value of certain other identifiable assets and liabilities, which included judgement principally with respect to the determination of carried interest receivable and related liabilities and specifically the assumed growth rates, realisation dates and appropriate discount rates.
The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, was accounted for as goodwill see note 29.
At each reporting date, the Group applies judgement to determine whether there is any indication that goodwill or an acquired intangible asset may be impaired.
If any indication exists and a full assessment determines that the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow model, details of which are provided on page 115.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and cannot be reversed.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
For all relevant acquisitions, it is the Groups judgement that the lowest level of CGU used to determine impairment is segment level for Asset Management.
The Benchmark Capital business within Wealth Management is assessed separately from the rest of Wealth Management.
The recoverable amount of acquired intangible assets is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and the updated discounted valuation of the remaining net residual income stream.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement but may be reversed if relevant conditions improve.
114 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 13.
Goodwill and intangible assets continued The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations applying a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions on which the Groups cash flow projections are based include long-term market growth rates of 2% per annum 2016: 2%, a pre-tax discount rate of 11% 2016: 10%, expected fund flows and expected changes to margins.
The results of the calculation indicate that goodwill is not impaired.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of goodwill to the methods and assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amounts of the CGUs is small.
This is due to the amount of goodwill allocated to the relevant CGU relative to the size of the relevant future profitability estimate.
Movements in the growth rate and or the discount rate of 1% would not lead to any impairment.
A comparison of actual results to the projected results used to assess goodwill impairment in prior years reveals that the Group would have recognised no changes 2016: nil to its goodwill asset in the year as a result of inaccurate projections.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent amounts of tax that will become recoverable and payable in future accounting periods.
They arise as a result of temporary differences, where the time at which profits and losses are recognised for tax purposes differs from the time at which the relevant transaction is recorded.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction that is expected to arise in a future period based on past transactions.
A deferred tax liability represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result of a current or prior year transaction.
Deferred tax liabilities also arise on certain acquisitions where the amortisation of the acquired intangible asset does not result in a tax deduction.
The deferred tax liability is established on acquisition and is released to the income statement to match the intangible asset amortisation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date.

Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities The Group operates a unit-linked life assurance business through the wholly-owned subsidiary, Schroder Pension Management Limited referred to as the Life Company.
The Life Company provides investment products through a life assurance wrapper.
The investment products do not provide cover for any insurance risk and are therefore recognised and accounted for as financial instruments and presented as financial liabilities due to Life Company investors policyholders within unit-linked liabilities.
The investment product is almost identical to a unit trust.
The Group earns fee income from managing the investment, which is included in revenue.
As it is a life assurance product, the contractual rights and obligations of the investments remain with the Group and the AUM is therefore included on the Groups statement of financial position, together with the liability to investors.
Financial assets and liabilities held by the Life Company are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Other balances include cash and receivables, which are measured at amortised cost see note 10.
The Life Companys assets are regarded as current assets as they represent the amount available to Life Company investors or third party investors in other funds who are able to withdraw their funds on call, subject to certain restrictions in the case of illiquidity.
Gains and losses from assets and liabilities held to cover investor obligations are attributable to investors in the Life Company or third party investors in the funds.
As a result, any gain or loss is offset by a change in the obligation to investors.
Unit-linked liabilities comprise: 2017 2016 m m Financial liabilities due to Life Company investors 10,591.4 10,273.3 1 Financial liabilities due to third party investors 3,395.0 2,654.3 13,986.4 12,927.6 1.
In accordance with accounting standards, the Group is deemed to hold a controlling interest in certain funds as a result of the investments held by the Life Company.
This results in all of the assets and liabilities of those funds being consolidated within the Groups statement of financial position and the third party interest in the fund being recorded as a financial liability due to third party investors.
The Group has no primary exposure to market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk in relation to the investments due to Life Company investors.
The risks and rewards associated with its investments are normally borne by the investors in the Life Companys investment products or third party investors in the funds and not by the Life Company itself.
Fair value measurements of Life Company financial assets and liabilities Each of the Life Companys financial assets and liabilities has been categorised using a fair value hierarchy.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined in note 10.
The Life Companys financial instruments at the year end date are analysed as follows: 2017 Financial instruments not at fair Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 value Total m m m m m Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 9,576.3 3,704.5 54.6 651.0 13,986.4 Unit-linked liabilities 13,906.1 42.8 37.5 13,986.4 2016 Financial instruments not at fair Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 value Total m m m m m Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 9,063.0 3,289.2 44.5 530.9 12,927.6 Unit-linked liabilities 12,840.9 49.2 37.5 12,927.6 116 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 15.
Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities continued The types of instruments found in each of the levels 1 and 3 for the Life Company are the same as those listed for the non-Life Company instruments in note 10.
Level 2 investments principally comprise commercial papers, certificates of deposit, forward foreign exchange contracts and certain debt securities.
No financial assets were transferred from level 1 to level 2 during the year.
During 2016, 1,927.7 million of debt securities were transferred from level 1 to level 2 during the year as a result of a change to the methodology applied by the Groups third party pricing provider.
This change did not represent a degradation in the quality of assets held.
The fair value of financial instruments not held at fair value approximates to their carrying value in 2016 and 2017.
Movements in financial assets categorised as level 3 during the year were: 2017 2016 m m At 1 January 44.5 43.4 Exchange translation adjustments 1.5 6.5 Gains recognised in the income statement 4.8 4.8 Additions 14.1 0.9 Disposals 10.3 11.1 At 31 December 54.6 44.5 16.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables at amortised cost represent amounts the Group is due to pay in the normal course of business and deferred income, being fees received in advance of services provided.
Amounts the Group is due to pay in the normal course of business are made up of creditors and accruals.
Accruals represent costs, including remuneration, that are not yet billed or due for payment, but for which the goods or services have been received.
Trade and other payables at fair value comprise deferred cash awards deferred employee remuneration payable in cash and bullion deposits by customers.
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value see note 10, as shown below.
The fair value of bullion deposits by customers is derived from level 1 inputs.
The fair value of deferred cash awards is derived from level 1 inputs, being equal to the fair value of the units in funds to which the employee award is linked.
Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 117 Financial statements Notes to the accounts The Groups trade and other payables contractually mature in the following time periods: 2017 2016 m m 1 Less than 1 year 824.8 772.8 1 2 years 58.9 60.9 2 5 years 51.3 49.0 More than 5 years 2.7 0.6 112.9 110.5 937.7 883.3 1.
Settlement accounts are generally settled within four working days and trade creditors have an average settlement period of 20 working days 2016:19workingdays.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities principally comprise deposits by Wealth Management clients and banking counterparties.
They also include derivatives held for client facilitation or interest rate matching in Wealth Management see note 20, and the hedging of risk exposures within investment capital.
Other financial liabilities mainly comprise liabilities that arise from third party interests in structured entities as a result of co-investment arrangements at amortised cost and third party interests in consolidated funds at fair value.
Consolidation occurs when the Group is deemed to control a fund, usually in respect of Life Company or seed capital investments.
When a fund is consolidated, the Group accounts for the fund in its statement of financial position as if it were wholly-owned by the Group, but records an additional liability representing the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third party investors.
Where the investment is held by the Life Company, the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third party investors is shown as part of unit-linked liabilities see note 15.
Following the acquisition of Adveq Holding AG see note 29, the Group has financial liabilities which were initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost or at fair value see note 10, as shown below.
Includes liabilities arising from the acquisition of Adveq Holding AG see note 29.
For the maturity profiles of client accounts, deposits by banks and derivative contracts see notes 19 and 20.
The fair value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost approximates to their carrying value.
Estimates and judgements The carrying value of financial liabilities may involve estimation or be derived from readily available sources.
Financial liabilities have been categorised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the extent of estimates and judgements used in the valuation.
The Groups financial liabilities categorised as level 3 principally consist of contingent consideration and other financial liabilities arising from prior acquisitions completed by the Group.
The carrying values of level 3 financial liabilities are typically derived from an estimate of the expected future cash flows required to settle the liability.
These estimates are typically derived from the projected performance of the acquired businesses for a number of years into the future.
For the Life Company, the fair values of level 3 financial liabilities are derived from the value of the related assets backing the liability see note 15.

Financial liabilities continued Fair value measurements The Group holds financial liabilities that are measured at fair value.
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy as defined in note 10.
The Groups financial liabilities held at fair value excluding those held in the Life Company see note 15 at the year end date are analysed as follows: 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 1 m m m m Derivative contracts 4.9 19.3 24.2 Other financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss 87.3 72.4 159.7 92.2 19.3 72.4 183.9 1.
The movement in Level 3 financial liabilities during 2017 comprises 32.2 million with regards to the acquisition of Adveq Holding AG see note 29 partly offset by other movements of 4.0 million.
2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Derivative contracts 1.4 20.9 22.3 Other financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss 69.5 1.4 44.2 115.1 70.9 22.3 44.2 137.4 18.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are liabilities where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount of settlement and therefore usually require the use of estimates.
They are recognised when three conditions are fulfilled: when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, when it is probable that the Group will incur a loss in order to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
They are recorded at the Groups best estimate of the cost of settling the obligation.
Any differences between those estimates and the amounts for which the Group actually becomes liable are taken to the income statement as additional charges where the Group has underestimated and credits where the Group has overestimated.
Where the estimated timing and settlement is longer-term, the amount is discounted using a rate reflecting specific risks associated with the provision.
Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities where there is even greater uncertainty, which could include a dependency on events not within the Groups control, but where there is a possible obligation.
Contingent liabilities are only disclosed and are not included within the statement of financial position.

Legal and regulatory obligations associated with the Groups business arise from past events that are estimated to crystallise mainly within two years 2016: two years.
Estimates and judgements The timing and amount of settlement of each legal claim or potential claim, regulatory matter and constructive obligation is uncertain.
TheGroup has performed an assessment of the timing and amount, and reviews this assessment periodically.
For some provisions, including the provision for onerous leases, there is greater certainty as the cash flows have largely been determined.
However, the onerous lease provision also includes an assessment of potential cash inflows where these are not contractually binding from subletting arrangements.
Potential legal claims, regulatory related costs and other obligations to third parties arise as a consequence of normal business activity.
They can arise from actual or alleged breaches of obligations and may be covered by the Groups insurance arrangements, but subject to insurance excess.
In certain circumstances, legal and regulatory claims can arise despite there being no error or breach.
Ourrisk management and compliance procedures are designed to mitigate, but are not able to eliminate, the risk of losses occurring.
Wheresuch claims and costs arise there is often uncertainty over whether a payment will be required and the quantum and timing of that payment.
As a result there is also uncertainty over the timing and amount of any insurance recovery, although this does not change the likelihood of insurance cover being available, where applicable.
The Group makes periodic assessments of all cash flows, including taking external advice where appropriate, to determine an appropriate provision.
Some matters may be settled through commercial negotiation aswell as being covered in whole or in part by the Groups insurance arrangements.
The Group has made provisions based on the reasonable expectation of likely outflows.
However the results of negotiations and insurance cover may result in different outcomes.
At 31 December 2017, there are no key judgements that would result in any material provisions being recognised or disclosed in the financial statements.
The estimates of provisions included in the financial statements at 31 December 2017 are based on estimates of reasonable ranges of likely outcomes applying assumptions regarding the probability of payments being due and the settlement value.
The aggregate reasonable ranges have been assessed as not materially different to the carrying values.

Assets pledged as collateral security reflect the value of instruments that the Group is required to hold with clearing agents in order to support the execution of the Groups security transactions.
The pledged assets provide collateral in the event of the Group not settling trades within agreed time frames.

Financial instrument risk management The Group allocates its total assets less liabilities, its net assets or capital, between operating capital, investment capital, seed and coinvestment capital and other capital.
TheGroup Capital Committee GCC is responsible for the management of capital and sets objectives for how it is deployed.
This note explains how the Group manages its capital, setting out the nature of the risks the Group faces as a result ofits operations, and how these risks are quantified and managed.
The Groups primary exposure to financial instrument risk is derived from the financial instruments that it holds as principal.
In addition, duetothe nature of the business, the Groups exposure extends to the impact on investment management and other fees that are determined on the basis of a percentage of AUM and are therefore impacted by financial instrument risk exposure of our clients the secondary exposure.
This note deals only with the direct or primary exposure of financial risks from the Groups holding of financial instruments see the Key Risks and Mitigations report on page 34.
The Group is exposed to multiple forms of risk including: i the risk that money owed to the Group will not be received credit risk : ii the risk that the Group may not have sufficient cash available to pay its creditors as they fall due liquidity risk : and iii the risk that the value ofassets will fluctuate as a result of movements in factors such as market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates market risk.
Themanagement of such risks is embedded in managerial responsibilities fundamental to the wellbeing of the Group.
The financial risks of these products are largely borne by thethird party investors, consistent with other investment products managed by the Group.
However, since the Life Company provides the investment products, both the investments and the third party obligations are recorded in the statement of financial position.
Financial instrument risk management disclosures in respect of the Life Companys financial instruments are set out in note 15. a Capital The Groups capital comprises: working capital employed in the Groups general operating activities, investment capital held in excess of operating requirements and other items that are not investible or available for the Groups operating and regulatory requirements.
The Group holds sufficient capital to support its business strategy and to meet its regulatory and working capital requirements.
Schroders plc is regulated by the PRA as a consolidated banking group.
It is required to maintain minimum Pillar 1 regulatory capital of 583million 2016: 526 million.
The Groups total capital requirement is 799 million 2016: 727 million.
In addition the Group is required tohold capital in its insurance entities, and to maintain buffers in accordance with EU regulation.
Including these amounts, the Groups overall regulatory capital requirement was 899 million at 31 December 2017 2016: 773 million.
This amount is included within working capital set outin the table below.
Reflecting the current regulatory transitional period, the Groups overall regulatory capital requirement increased to 944million on 1 January 2018 1 January 2017: 814 million.
The Groups regulatory surplus capital, comprising the Groups total equity less regulatory deductions and the regulatory capital requirement, was 1.4 billion 2016: 1.5 billion.
The Group and all regulated entities within the Group complied with minimum regulatory capital requirements during the year.
Total capital comprises: 2017 2016 m m Working capital regulatory and other 1,090 879 Working capital seed and co-investment 392 325 Investment capital liquid 696 915 1 Investment capital illiquid 147 144 2 Other items 1,146 890 Total equity 3,471 3,153 1.
Includes RWC Partners Limited and Schroder Ventures Investment Limited associates.
Comprises goodwill, intangible assets, pension scheme surplus, other associates and joint ventures and deferred tax.
i Working capital The Groups policy is for subsidiaries to hold sufficient capital to meet their regulatory and working capital requirements and to maintain anappropriate standing with counterparties.
Globally, local regulators oversee the activities of, and impose minimum capital and liquidity requirements on the Groups operating entities.
Working capital is also deployed through certain subsidiaries to support new investment strategies and growth opportunities and to co-invest alongside the Groups clients.
ii Investment capital Capital held in excess of working capital requirements is transferred to investment capital where investible.
Investment capital is managed with the aim of achieving a low-volatility return.
It is mainly held in government and  bonds, investment grade corporate bonds, cash equivalents and funds managed by the Group.
These liquid investments are available to support the organic development of existing and new business strategies and to respond to other investment and growth opportunities as they arise, such as acquisitions.
Investment capital also includes certain illiquid legacy investments.
iii Other items Other items comprises assets that are not investible or available to meet the Groups general operating or regulatory requirements.
It includes assets that are actually or potentially inadmissible for regulatory capital purposes such as goodwill and intangible assets.

Financial instrument risk management continued The categorisation of the Groups assets and liabilities the difference between which represents the Groups capital analysed by accounting treatment is summarised below: 2017 At fair value through profit or loss Loans and Designated as at Non-financial receivables liabilities Held to Held for fair value through Availableinstruments at amortised cost maturity trading profit or loss for-sale and other Total m m m m m m m Assets Cash and cash equivalents 2,947.0 2,947.0 Trade and other receivables 671.3 67.7 739.0 Financial assets non-debt securities 1,340.5 800.4 32.0 73.8 2,246.7 Financial assets debt securities 141.5 10.2 161.3 921.1 1,234.1 Associates and joint ventures 143.9 143.9 Property, plant and equipment 162.8 162.8 Goodwill and intangible assets 825.8 825.8 Deferred tax 39.3 39.3 Retirement benefit scheme surplus 162.9 162.9 Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 651.0 13,335.4 13,986.4 Total assets 5,751.3 10.2 961.7 13,367.4 994.9 1,402.4 22,487.9 Liabilities Trade and other payables 688.0 137.6 112.1 937.7 Financial liabilities 3,771.4 24.2 159.7 3,955.3 Current tax 78.1 78.1 Provisions 44.0 44.0 Deferred tax 0.1 0.1 Retirement benefit scheme deficits 15.3 15.3 Unit-linked liabilities 37.5 13,948.9 13,986.4 Total liabilities 4,540.9 24.2 14,246.2 205.6 19,016.9 Capital 3,471.0 2016 At fair value through profit or loss Loans and Designated as at Non-financial receivables liabilities Held to Held for fair value through Availableinstruments at amortised cost maturity trading profit or loss for-sale and other Total m m m m m m m Assets Cash and cash equivalents 3,318.9 3,318.9 Trade and other receivables 580.8 67.4 648.2 Financial assets non-debt securities 1,134.7 501.5 0.7 199.0 1,835.9 Financial assets debt securities 218.9 149.5 318.3 582.4 1,269.1 Associates and joint ventures 125.0 125.0 Property, plant and equipment 66.4 66.4 Goodwill and intangible assets 607.1 607.1 Deferred tax 66.0 66.0 Retirement benefit scheme surplus 118.2 118.2 Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 530.9 12,396.7 12,927.6 Total assets 5,784.2 149.5 819.8 12,397.4 781.4 1,050.1 20,982.4 Liabilities Trade and other payables 656.7 122.3 104.3 883.3 Financial liabilities 3,764.6 22.3 115.1 3,902.0 Current tax 71.8 71.8 Provisions 33.1 33.1 Deferred tax 0.2 0.2 Retirement benefit scheme deficits 11.6 11.6 Unit-linked liabilities 37.5 12,890.1 12,927.6 Total liabilities 4,491.9 22.3 13,127.5 187.9 17,829.6 Capital 3,152.8 122 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 19.
Financial instrument risk management continued b Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk Financial instruments give rise to credit, liquidity and market risk exposures.
Settlement of financial instruments on both a principal and agency basis gives rise to operational risk.
The execution and effectiveness of the Groups risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Board, with responsibility for oversight delegated to the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Group applies the three lines of defence model to risk management, which includes financial instrument risk.
More details on this are set out in the Key Risks and Mitigations report and the Audit and Risk Committee report on pages 34 and 56. i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument, loan or commitment will cause the Group financial loss by failing to discharge an obligation.
For this purpose, the impact on fair value of a credit loss arising from credit spread price changes in a portfolio of investments is excluded.
This risk is addressed within Pricing risk.
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where it is exposed to the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay, in full, amounts when due.
The Group carefully manages its exposure to credit risk by: approving lending policies that specify the type of acceptable collateral and minimum lending margins: setting limits for exposures to individual counterparties and sectors: and by taking security.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
In addition the Group holds collateral on its loans and advances to clients and certain derivative positions.
The Group also holds collateral on some short-term advances to counterparties, as part of its liquidity management.
The collateral accepted includes investment-grade securities that can be sold or repledged without default of the provider.
At 31 December 2017 the fair value of collateral which could be sold or repledged but had not been, relating solely to these arrangements, was 591.4 million 2016: 495.5 million.
Loans, overdrafts and advances to clients are secured on a range of assets including real estate both residential and commercial, cash, client portfolios and life insurance policies.
The Group does not usually provide loans, overdrafts and advances to clients onan unsecured basis.
Where disposal of non-cash collateral is required, in the event of default, the terms and conditions relevant to the specific contract and country will apply.
Portfolios held as collateral are marked to market daily and positions compared to clients exposures.
Credit limits are set following an assessment of the market value and lending value of each type of collateral, depending on the perceived risk associated with the collateral.
Clients are contacted if these limits are breached, or if collateral is not sufficient to cover the outstanding exposure.
The amount of change in the year in the fair value of loans and receivables held at fair value through profit or loss that is attributable to changes in credit risk is nil 2016: nil and nil 2016: nil cumulatively.
Wealth Management takes a conservative approach to its treasury investments placing them with, or purchasing debt securities issued by, UKand overseas banks and corporates, central banks, supranational banks and sovereigns.
Debt securities held within the Wealth Management treasury book are classified as loans and receivables, held to maturity or available-for-sale financial assets and are unsecured.
Policies covering various counterparty and market risk limits are set and monitored by the relevant Wealth Management asset and liability management committees.
All instruments held within Wealth Management have an investment grade credit rating.
Other activities Fee debtors and other receivables arise as a result of the Groups asset management activities and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant and unless a client has withdrawn its funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
Fee debtors past due but not yet impaired as at 31 December 2017 were 21.9 million 2016: 29.8 million, the majority of which is less than 90 days past due 2016: less than 90 days past due.
Factors considered in determining whether impairment has taken place include how many days past the due date a receivable is, deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, and knowledge of specific events that could influence a debtors ability to pay.
Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 123 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 19.
Financial instrument risk management continued The Group seeks to manage its exposure to credit risk arising from debt securities and derivatives within the investment portfolio by adopting aconservative approach and through ongoing credit analysis.
Cash is held with well-rated banks, government and  bonds are rated Aor better, corporate bond portfolios have an investment grade mandate, and exposure to sub-investment grade debt is low.
Derivative positions are taken in exchange-traded securities where there is minimal credit risk.
Forward foreign exchange positions generally have a maturity of one month.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents in the non-Wealth Management entities are invested primarily in current accounts, on deposit with well-rated banks, and invested in money market funds.
ii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Group has a clearly defined liquidity risk management framework in place in the form of a Consolidated Group Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP.
TheGroup policy is that its subsidiaries should trade solvently, comply with regulatory liquidity requirements, and have adequate liquidity for allactivities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, all companies should maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Wealth Management activities The principal liquidity risk the Group faces concerns its Wealth Management liabilities where the settlement of deposits can be impacted by client action.
The objective of the Groups liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity within the relevant entities to meet regulatory and prudential requirements, to cover cash flow imbalances and fluctuations in funding, and to ensure the timely repayment of funds to depositors.
Includes loans and advances to clients held at fair value through profit or loss of 0.6 million 2016: 0.6 million.
124 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 19.
Financial instrument risk management continued Other activities Liquidity risk in the rest of the Group is low.
Excluding the Life Company and consolidated funds, the Asset Management and Group segment together hold cash and cash equivalents of 640.6 million 2016: 664.0 million.
Financial liabilities relating to other operating entities are 200.8million 2016: 123.0 million, the majority ofwhich arecurrent.
The Group has a committed loan facility of 510.0 million 2016: 200.0 million that expires on 4 October 2022 and 1.0 million 2016:1.8million of loan notes as part of the acquisition of Cazenove Capital that are repayable on 12 July 2018 and subject to early redemption rights incertain circumstances.
iii Market risk Market risk is the risk that the value of assets will fluctuate as a result of movements in factors such as market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Pricing risk Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk.
In respect of financial instrument risk, the Groups exposure to pricing risk is principally through investments held in investment capital, seed and co-investment capital, deferred employee compensation in the form of fund awards and some investments held for regulatory capital purposes.
However, the more significant risk is the impact on the Groups fee income as this is principally determined on percentages of the fair value of AUM.
This risk cannot be easily mitigated but is addressed to some extent by ongoing net new business.
The Group does not hedge exposure to pricing risk except for seed capital, where practical to do so, and also in respect of deferred employee compensation awards in the form of interests in funds managed by the Group.
Where financial instruments are held to hedge deferred compensation awards this is normally offset by changes in the amounts payable to employees see note 5.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Wealth Management activities In Wealth Management, interest rate risk is monitored against policies and limits set by the relevant risk committee on a daily basis.
Interest rate risk is managed within the set limits by matching asset and liability positions and through the use of interest rate swaps.
Sensitivity-based and stress-based models are used for monitoring interest rate risk.
These involve assessing the impact of a prescribed basis point rise in interest rates, together with extreme scenarios for the stress tests.
The impact is calculated regularly for each currency and in aggregate.
Other activities Cash held by the other operating companies is not normally expected to be placed on deposit for longer than three months and is not exposed to significant interest rate risk.
The Groups capital includes investments in government bonds and corporate investment-grade bonds managed by the Groups fixed income fund managers.
The market risk including interest rate risk exposure of these investments is actively monitored against limits set by the Group Capital Committee.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Wealth Management activities In Wealth Management, some loans and advances to clients, client deposits and a proportion of the treasury activities are undertaken in foreign currencies.
This is managed by the treasury departments within agreed limits that are set and monitored by the relevant risk committees.
Other activities The Groups policy in relation to revenue, expenditure and capital currency exposure in Asset Management activities is generally not to hedge.
The Groups revenue is earned and expenditure incurred in many currencies and the resulting exposure is considered to be a normal part of the Groups business activities.
The Group also has exposure to foreign currency through investments in currencies other than sterling.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts with third parties to mitigate this exposure.
The gain or loss on the hedging instruments is included in the statement of other comprehensive income or the income statement, as appropriate.

Derivative contracts a The Groups use of derivatives The Group holds derivatives for risk management, client facilitation, and within its investment portfolios to provide exposure to market returns.
The Group most commonly uses forward foreign exchange contracts where it agrees to buy or sell specified amounts of a named currency at a future date, allowing the Group effectively to fix exchange rates so that it can avoid unpredictable gains and losses on receivables and payables in foreign currencies.
The Group uses equity contracts to hedge market-related gains and losses on its seed capital investments where the purpose of investing is to help establish a new product rather than gain additional market exposure.
Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposures to fixed or floating rates of interest.
Risk management: the Group actively seeks to limit and manage its exposures to risk where that exposure is not desired by the Group.
Thismaytake the form of unwanted exposures to a particular currency, type of interest rate or other price risk.
By entering into derivative contracts, the Group is able to mitigate or eliminate such exposures.
The principal risk that the Group faces through such use of derivative contracts is credit risk.
Client facilitation: the Groups Wealth Management entities are involved in providing portfolio management, banking and investment advisory services, primarily to private clients.
In carrying out this business, they transact as agent or as principal in financial assets and liabilities including derivatives in order to facilitate client portfolio requirements.
Wealth Managements policy is to hedge, as appropriate, exchange rate and interest rate risk on its client facilitation positions.
This does not eliminate the possibility of credit risk.
For details of how the Group manages its exposure to credit risk, see b below and note 19.
126 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 20.
Derivative contracts continued b Derivatives used by the Group Currency forwards are contractual obligations to receive or pay amounts based on changes in currency rates or to buy or sell foreign currency or a financial instrument on a future date at a specified price.
For currency forward contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates for example, fixed rate for floating rate or a combination of all these i. e. cross-currency interest rate swaps.
No exchange of principal takes place, except in the case of certain currency swaps.
The Groups credit risk represents the potential cost of replacing the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligations.
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts, and the liquidity of the market.
To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties in accordance with its internal policies and procedures.
Foreign exchange, equity and interest rate options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, either to buy a call option or sell a put option at or by a set date or during a set period, a specific amount of a foreign currency or a financial instrument at a predetermined price.
The seller receives a premium from the purchaser and assumes foreign exchange, equity or interest rate risk.
Options may be either exchange-traded or negotiated between the Group and a customer or market counterparty.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on purchased options only, and only to the extent of their carrying amount, which is their fair value.
Futures contracts are standardised contracts to buy or sell specified assets for an agreed price at a specified future date.
Contracts are negotiated at a futures exchange which acts as an intermediary between the two parties.
For futures contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
The fair value of derivative instruments becomes favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, foreign exchange rates and other relevant variables relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable, and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities, can fluctuate significantly from time to time.

Share capital and share premium Share capital represents the number of issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares in Schroders plc multiplied by their nominal value of 1 each.
Share premium substantially represents the aggregate of all amounts that have ever been paid above nominal value to Schroders plc when it has issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares.
There are certain circumstances in which the share premium can be reduced but these have not arisen in 2016 or 2017.
The Company has no authority to issue, buy back, or cancel ordinary shares in issue including those held in trust and has authority limited by shareholder resolution to issue or purchase non-voting ordinary shares, which may either be cancelled or held in treasury.

Own shares Own shares are recorded by the Group when non-voting ordinary shares are acquired by the Company, or ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares are acquired through employee benefit trusts.
There are two main reasons why this may happen: first, the Group may wish to hold some of its shares in treasury to settle option exercises or for other permitted purposes.
Second, it enables the Group to meet share-based remuneration awards to employees in the form of shares see note 26 in a way that does not dilute the percentage holdings of existing shareholders.
Own shares are held at cost and their purchase reduces the Groups net assets by the amount spent.
When shares vest unconditionally or are cancelled, they are transferred from own shares to the profit and loss reserve at their weighted average cost.

Commitments Commitments represent amounts the Group has contractually committed to pay to third parties but which do not yet represent a liability.
Commitments at the year end do not impact on the Groups financial results for the year.
The Group leases office space and equipment.
Lease agreements can commit the Group to significant future expenditure and the table below discloses the Groups commitments to make such payments.
Such commitments are not recorded on the Groups statement of financial position in advance of the period to which they relate.
The Group sublets a small number of its owned and leased properties where such properties, or parts of such properties, are not required for use by the Group.
The table below discloses the commitments sub-lessees have made in respect of such arrangements.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group has two types of pension benefit for employees: defined benefit DB where the Group has an obligation to provide participating employees with pension payments that represent a specified percentage of their final salary for each year of service, and defined contribution DC, where the Groups contribution to an employees pension is measured as, and limited to, a specified percentage of salary.
Accounting for DB schemes requires an assessment of the likely quantum of future pension payments to be made.
If ring-fenced assets are held specifically to meet this cost, the scheme is funded, and if not, it is unfunded.
The Group periodically reviews its funded DB schemes using actuarial specialists to assess whether it is on course to meet the expected pension payments that current and former employees are or will be entitled to.
In the case of a projected shortfall, a plan must be formulated to reverse the deficit.
The income statement charge or credit represents the sum of pension entitlements earned by employees in the period, plus a notional net interest charge if the scheme is in deficit or income if it is in surplus based on the market yields on high quality corporate bonds.
Experience differences, principally the difference between actual investment returns and the notional interest amount, as well as actuarial changes in estimating the present value of future liabilities, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Assets or liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position represent the differences between the fair value of plan assets if any and the  estimates of the present value of future liabilities.
The Group closed its largest DB scheme to future accrual on 30 April 2011, although it still operates some small unfunded schemes overseas.
This means that no future service will contribute to the closed scheme member benefits but those members continue to have the benefits determined by the Scheme rules as at 30 April 2011.
The Groups exposure to funding DC pension schemes is limited to the contributions it has agreed to make.
These contributions generally stop when employment ceases.
The income statement charge represents the contributions the Group has agreed to make into employees pension schemes in that period.
The disclosures within this note are provided mainly in respect of the principal DB scheme which is the DB section of the funded Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme the Scheme.
The income statement charge for retirement benefit costs is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Pension costs defined contribution plans 42.8 40.4 Pension credit defined benefit plans 1.5 2.7 Other post-employment benefits 0.2 0.2 41.5 37.9 i Profile of the Scheme The Scheme is administered by a Trustee company, Schroder Pension Trustee Limited.
The board of the Trustee company comprises an independent chairman, three directors appointed by the employer and two directors elected by the Scheme members.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for setting the investment strategy and for the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
The Trustees investment committee comprises four of the Trustee directors and two representatives of the Group.
This committee, which reports to the Trustee board, is responsible for making investment strategy recommendations to the board of the Trustee and for monitoring the performance of the investment manager.
Under the Scheme, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on a specified percentage of their final pensionable salary or, in the case of active members at 30 April 2011 the date the DB section of the Scheme closed for future accrual, actual pensionable salaries at that date, for each year of service.
These benefits are adjusted for the effects of inflation, subject to a cap of 2.5% for pensions accrued after 12 August 2007 and 5.0% for pensions accrued before that date.
As at 31 December 2017, there were no active members in the DB section 2016: nil and 1,828 active members in the DC section 2016: 1,753.
The weighted average duration of the Schemes DB obligation is 21 years 2016: 21 years.
Membership details of the DB section of the Scheme as at 31 December are as follows: 2017 2016 Number of deferred members 1,418 1,535 Total deferred pensions at date of leaving Scheme 10.9m per annum 13.2m per annum Average age deferred 52 51 Number of pensioners 829 796 Average age pensioners 69 69 Total pensions in payment 18.9m per annum 18.1m per annum ii Funding requirements The last completed triennial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2014.
The funding level at that date was 109% on the technical provisions basis and no contribution to the Scheme was required 2016: nil.
The next triennial valuation is due as at 31 December 2017 and will be performed in 2018.

Retirement benefit obligations continued iii Risks of the Scheme The Company and the Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes, as detailed below, an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Scheme by investing in assets such as swaps which perform in line with the liabilities of the Scheme so as to protect against inflation and or interest rates being higher than expected.
The most significant risks that the Scheme exposes the Group to are: Asset Volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this may create a deficit.
The Group manages this risk by holding 50.7% 2016: 51.4% of Scheme assets in an LDI portfolio and the remainder in growth assets such as the Schroder Life Diversified Growth Fund and a Strategic Beta portfolio.
This asset mix is designed to provide returns that match or exceed the unwinding of the discount rate in the long term, but which can create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long-term objectives.
Credit risk The assets of the Scheme include LDI and other fixed income instruments that expose the Group to credit risk.
A significant amount of this exposure is to the UK Government as a result of holding gilts and bonds guaranteed by the UK Government.
Other instruments held include derivatives, which are collateralised daily to cover unrealised gains or losses.
The minimum rating for any derivatives counterparty is BBB.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this should be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes LDI portfolio which comprises gilts and other LDI instruments.
The LDI portfolio has been designed to mitigate interest rate exposures measured on a funding rather than an accounting basis.
One of the principal differences between these bases is that the liability under the funding basis is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to gilt yields: the latter uses corporate bond yields.
As a result, the LDI portfolio hedges against interest rate risk by purchasing instruments that seek to replicate movements in gilt yields rather than corporate bond yields.
Movements in the different types of instrument are not exactly correlated, and it is therefore likely that a tracking error can arise when assessing whether the LDI portfolio has provided an effective hedge against interest rate risk on an accounting basis.
At 31 December 2017, the LDI portfolio was designed to mitigate 73% 2016: 74% of the Schemes exposure to changes in gilt yields.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
However, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against inflation.
The majority of the growth assets are either unaffected by or not closely correlated with inflation, which means that an increase in inflation will also decrease any Scheme surplus.
The LDI portfolio includes instruments such as index-linked gilts to provide protection against inflation risk.
At 31 December 2017, the LDI portfolio was designed to mitigate 73% 2016: 74% of the Schemes exposure to inflation risk.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liability.
iv Reporting at 31 December The principal financial assumptions used for the Scheme were as listed below: 2017 2016 % % Discount rate 2.6 2.7 RPI inflation rate 3.3 3.4 CPI inflation rate 2.2 2.3 Future pension increases for benefits earned before 13 August 2007 3.1 3.2 Future pension increases for benefits earned after 13 August 2007 2.2 2.2 Average number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond age 60: Men 28 29 Women 30 30 Average number of years future pensioners currently aged 45 are expected to live beyond age 60: Men 29 30 Women 31 32 The net interest for pension costs is determined by applying the corporate bond rate to the opening net surplus in the Scheme.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value ofestimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, theGroup considers the interest rates of high quality, long dated corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will bepaid.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Estimates and judgements The Group estimates the carrying value of the Scheme through applying the assumptions set out on page 133.
The sensitivity to those assumptions is set out below.
The most significant judgemental assumption relates to mortality rates which are inherently uncertain.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables with Continuous Mortality Investigation core projection factors and a long-term rate of mortality improvement of1.0% 2016: 1.5% perannum.
Mortality tables for male pensioners are scaled back by 5% and female pensioners are scaled back by 10% to reflect the history of longer life expectancy of the Groups employees.
The Group reviews its assumptions annually in conjunction with its independent actuaries and considers this adjustment appropriate given the geographic and demographic profile of Scheme members.
Other assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
The financial impact of the Scheme on the Group has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Aon Hewitt Limited, and is based on an assessment of the Scheme as at 31 December 2017.
The amounts recognised in the income statement are: 2017 2016 m m Interest income on Scheme assets 28.0 34.6 Interest cost on Scheme liabilities 24.8 30.2 Net interest income recognised in the income statement in respect of the Scheme 3.2 4.4 Income statement charge in respect of other defined benefit schemes 1.7 1.7 Total defined benefit schemes income statement credit 1.5 2.7 The amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are: 2017 2016 m m Return on Scheme assets in excess of that recognised in interest income 20.6 174.3 Actuarial gains due to change in demographic assumptions 27.2 16.5 Actuarial losses due to change in financial assumptions 1.7 202.7 Actuarial losses gains due to experience 4.6 10.3 Total other comprehensive income loss in respect of the Scheme 41.5 1.6 Other comprehensive income losses in respect of other defined benefit schemes 0.8 0.4 Total other comprehensive income losses in respect of defined benefit schemes 42.3 2.0 The sensitivity of the Scheme pension liabilities to changes in assumptions is as follows: 2017 2016 Estimated Estimated Estimated Estimated increase increase increase increase reduction in reduction in reduction in reduction in pension pension pension pension liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities Assumption Assumption change m % m % Discount rate Increase by 0.5% per annum 93.6 10.8 98.2 10.1 Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% per annum 102.1 11.8 107.1 11.0 Expected rate of pension increases Increase by 0.5% per annum 79.7 9.2 83.9 8.6 Expected rate of pension increases Decrease by 0.5% per annum 74.9 8.6 78.4 8.0 Life expectancy Reduce by one year 33.4 3.9 35.3 3.6 134 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 25.

Share-based payments Share-based payments are remuneration payments to selected employees that take the form of an award of shares in Schroders plc.
Employees are generally not able to exercise such awards in full until three years after the award has been made, although conditions vary between different types of award.
The accounting for share-based awards settled by transferring shares to the employees equity-settled differs from the accounting for similar awards settled in cash cash-settled.
The charge for equity-settled share-based payments is determined based on the fair value of the award on the grant date or, in the case of grandfathered awards arising on business combinations, the fair value of the share awards at the acquisition date.
Such awards can include share options or share awards which may or may not have performance criteria.
The initial fair value of the award takes into account the current value of shares expected to be issued i. e. estimates of the likely levels of forfeiture and achievement of performance criteria, the contribution, if required, by the employee and the time value of money.
This initial fair value is charged to the income statement reflecting benefits received from employment, where relevant, in the performance period and over the vesting period.
The income statement charge is offset by a credit to the statement of changes in equity, where the award is expected to be settled through the issue of shares.
Such awards constituted 7.7% 2016: 7.2% of salaries and other remuneration.
The Group may make share-based payments to employees through awards over or linked to the value of ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares and by the grant of market value share options over ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares.
These arrangements involve a maximum term of 10 years.
It is the Groups practice to hedge all awards to eliminate the impact of changes in the market value of shares between the grant date and the exercise date.
Awards that lapse or are forfeited during the vesting period result in a credit to the income statement reversing the previous charge in the year in which they lapse or are forfeited.

Share-based payments continued The Group recognised total expenses of 62.0 million 2016: 52.4 million arising from share-based payment transactions during the year, ofwhich 60.5 million 2016: 51.5 million were equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
There were no exceptional costs included within equity-settled share-based payments during 2017 2016: 0.9 million.
The Group has the following share-based payment arrangements further details of the current schemes may be found in the Remunerationreport : a 2000 Equity Compensation Plan and 2011 Equity Compensation Plan Awards over ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares made under the Groups Equity Compensation Plans are charged at fair value as Operating expenses in the income statement.
There are no performance conditions attached to the awards.
For the 2000 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares at the date of grant, discounted for the dividends forgone over the average holding period of the award.
For the 2011 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
The fair value charges, adjusted to reflect actual levels of vesting, are spread over the performance period and the vesting period of the awards.
The award is structured as a nil-cost option.

Interests in structured entities Structured entities are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who has control, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Groups interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities are described below.
The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of contractual arrangements arising from its principal activity, the management of assets on behalf of its clients.
AUM, excluding deposits by Wealth Management clients and some segregated client portfolios held within the Institutional channel of the Groups Asset Management business, are managed within structured entities.
These structured entities typically consist of investment vehicles such as Open Ended Investment Companies, Authorised Unit Trusts, Limited Partnerships and Socits dInvestissement Capital Variable, which entitle investors to a percentage of the vehicles net asset value.
The vehicles are financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors.
The Group also has interests in structured entities through proprietary investments.
These are mainly into vehicles which help facilitate the Groups stated aim of generating a return on investment capital and when it deploys seed and co-investment capital in developing new investment strategies.
The Group does not have any contractual relationships with, or interests in, structured entities related to AUA.
Additionally, the Group holds interests in structured entities for liquidity management purposes, for example via investments in money market funds.
The Group does not guarantee returns on the investments it manages or commit to financially support its structured entities.
A small proportion of the Groups AUM, principally real estate funds, are permitted to raise finance through loans from banks and other financial institutions.
Where external finance is raised, the Group does not provide a guarantee for the repayment of any borrowings.
The business activity of all structured entities in which the Group has an interest, is the management of assets in order to generate investment returns for investors from capital appreciation and or investment income.
The Group earns a management fee from its structured entities, normally based on a percentage of the entitys net asset value, committed capital value or gross asset value and, where contractually agreed, a performance fee, based on outperformance against predetermined benchmarks.
In addition, where the Group owns a proportion of the structured entity it is entitled to receive investment returns.
a Interests arising from managing assets The Groups interests in structured entities arising as a result of contractual relationships from its principal activity, the management of assets on behalf of its clients, are reflected in the Groups AUM.

Interests in structured entities continued Certain AUM is managed in pooled vehicles that are not considered to be structured entities.
Within Asset Management, this occurs either because it is formed of segregated investment portfolios for Institutional clients comprising directly-held investments in individual financial instruments, or because the voting structures of the vehicles themselves allow the investment manager to be removed without cause.
Within Wealth Management AUM is not considered to be within structured entities due to contractual relationships existing with clients rather than structured entities, for example discretionary and advisory asset management and banking services.
In addition, Wealth Management AUM in the form of loans and advances to customers is conducted outside of structured entities.
Certain structured entities are deemed to be controlled by the Group and are accounted for as subsidiaries and consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10.
AUM within consolidated structured entities represents the net assets of the beneficial interest in the consolidated structured entity owned by third parties.
AUM within unconsolidated structured entities constitutes the remaining balance, represented principally by the net asset value of pooled vehicles managed for Intermediary clients, as well as some assets invested in pooled vehicles on behalf of Institutional and Wealth Management clients.
The Groups beneficial interest in structured entities is not included within AUM and is described separately below.
The Group has no direct exposure to losses in relation to the AUM reported above, as the investment risk is borne by clients.
The main risk the Group faces from its interest in AUM managed on behalf of clients is the loss of fee income as a result of the withdrawal of funds by clients.
Outflows from funds are dependant on market sentiment, asset performance and investor considerations.
Fee income includes 1,367.6 million 2016: 1,182.3 million of fees from structured entities managed by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying value of the Groups interests in structured entities as a result of its management of assets, where income is accrued over the period for which assets are managed before being invoiced.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise investments in money market funds, of which 26.5 million 2016: 30.2 million is managed by the Group.
Financial assets comprise investments in pooled vehicles and legacy private equity investments and include seed and co-investment capital and hedges of deferred cash awards see note 16.
Of the financial assets, 583.6 million 2016: 470.2 million is invested in funds managed by the Group.
The Group has no interest apart from its role as investor in those funds for which it does not act as manager.
The main risk the Group faces from its interests in unconsolidated structured entities arising from proprietary investments is that the investments will decrease in value.
Note 19 includes further information on the Groups exposure to market risk arising from proprietary investments.
Following the Groups acquisition of Adveq Holding AG see note 29, the Group has a contractual obligation to provide 1% of committed capital to certain structured entities of the acquiree.
See note 24 for the Groups investment call commitments at 31 December 2017.
The Groups statement of financial position also includes the Life Company assets of 13,986.4 million 2016: 12,927.6 million, which are included in the AUM information presented on page 139.
The exposure to the risks and rewards associated with these assets is borne by unit-linked policyholders, or, where Life Company funds are consolidated, third party investors in those funds.
Financial support for consolidated structured entities where there is no contractual obligation to do so The Group supports some of its funds through the injection of seed capital in order to enable the funds to establish a track record before they are more widely marketed.
During the year, the Group purchased units at a cost of 189.4 million 2016: 129.6 million to provide seed capital toinvestment funds managed by the Group, of which 162.2 million 2016: 114.0 million resulted in the consolidation of those funds, and 27.2million 2016: 15.6 million did not.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and any equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest NCI in the acquiree on an  basis, either at fair value or at the NCI proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The Group completed five business combinations during the year.
The most significant of these transactions completed on 31 July 2017 when the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Adveq Holding AG Adveq, a Swiss-registered holding company of a private equity management group for a total consideration of 141.3 million.
The acquisition contributed 6.0 billion of Asset Management AUM and strengthens the Groups private assets capabilities.
On 17 February 2017, the Group acquired the discretionary wealth management business of C. Hoare & Co. for a consideration of 72.0 million.
The acquisition contributed 2.5 billion of discretionary Wealth Management AUM and increases the Groups scale and capability for its UK private clients.
On 1 September 2017 and 4 December 2017, Benchmark Capital, a 65% subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Brian Potter Consultants Limited and Alderbrook Financial Planning Limited respectively.
The combined consideration for these transactions was 2.1 million.
On 1 November 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Chilcomb Wealth Ltd, a UK-based wealth manager, for a consideration of 1.7 million.
Net assets acquired The fair values of the net assets acquired in the transactions together with the goodwill and intangible assets arising are as follows: 2 Adveq C. Hoare & Co.

Contingent consideration of 23.4 million is payable under the terms of the share purchase agreement for Adveq.
This amount is contingent upon the receipt of future revenues over a number of years.
The estimated range of amounts that will ultimately be payable is between 16 million and 114 million.

Business combinations continued Adveq Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Adveq represents the value of the acquired business arising from: A broader platform for business growth: Talented management and employees: and Opportunities for synergies from combining certain activities.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Adveq will not be deductible for tax purposes.
In the period between the acquisition date on 31 July 2017 and 31 December 2017, Adveq contributed 19.8 million to the Groups net income.
Thecontribution to profit before tax and exceptional items was 4.6 million and exceptional costs of 2.7 million were incurred, including charges in respect of amortisation of the acquired intangible assets, other interest charges and restructuring costs.
Additionally, acquisition costs of 1.1 million were recorded within Operating expenses and classified as exceptional in the Consolidated income statement.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2017, the Groups pre-exceptional net income for the year would have been 2,091.4 million, and the profit before tax and exceptional items for the year on the same basis would have been 801.6 million.

The goodwill arising on the acquisition represents the value of the acquired business arising from: A broader platform for business growth: Talented management and employees: and Opportunities for synergies from combining certain Wealth Management operations.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes.
In the period between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2017, the discretionary wealth management business of C. Hoare & Co. contributed 18.3 million to the Groups pre-exceptional net income within the Wealth Management segment.
The contribution to profit before tax and exceptional items was 13.3 million and exceptional operating expenses of 3.3 million were incurred in respect of amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
If the acquisition had completed on 1 January 2017, the Groups pre-exceptional net income for the year would have been 2,071.5 million.
Profit before tax and exceptional items for the year on the same basis would have been 802.4 million.
Estimates and judgements The fair value of certain items of consideration, assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires some estimation.
For contingent consideration payable on the acquisition of Adveq this estimation required assumptions regarding the level of management fees that will be earned over the relevant period and carried interest revenue that will be generated.
The most judgemental estimation was in respect of carried interest revenue, which required assumptions on growth rates and crystallisation dates for each fund on which carried interest is earned and an appropriate discount rate.
Certain assets acquired, including intangible assets arising on acquisition, as well as liabilities assumed also required some estimation.
Thekey assumptions included those in respect of carried interest revenue for Adveq as set out above, and management fees relating to all acquisitions.
The assumptions affect the impact of carried interest upon the contingent consideration, revenue receivable, employee rights to carried interest and third party interests through co-investment arrangements.
The net impact of changes to these assumptions would be to change the carrying value of individual assets and liabilities with a corresponding change to goodwill.
The reasonable range of potential outcomes of contingent consideration undiscounted is between 16million and 114 million, compared with the Groups estimate of the amount payable of 23.4 million.

Financial instrument risk management The Companys policy is to have adequate capital for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, it should have adequate capital to maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Generally, surplus capital is loaned back to the Groups investment capital management entities.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
Details of the Groups risk management processes are outlined in the Key risks and mitigations section within the Strategic report and the Risk and internal controls section within the Audit and Risk Committee report as well as in note 19.
The Companys specific risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys counterparties are predominantly its subsidiaries and therefore there is minimal external credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Groups liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash flow funding, meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency.
The Company holds sufficient liquid funds to cover its needs in the normal course of business.
The Company can recall intercompany loans to subsidiaries or utilise the Group loan facility to maintain sufficient liquidity.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
At 31 December 2017, if interest rates had been 50 bps higher 2016: 50 bps higher or 50 bps lower 2016: 25 bps lower with all other variables held constant, the Company estimates that post-tax profit for the year would have increased by 5 million 2016: increased by 4 million or decreased by 5 million 2016: decreased by 2 million respectively.
These changes are mainly as a result of net interest income on the Companys interest-bearing intercompany receivables and payables and cash.
Other components of equity are not directly affected by interest rate movements.
The model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits does not take into account the indirect effect of interest rates on the fair value of other assets and liabilities.
Foreign exchange and pricing risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Company is not directly exposed to foreign exchange or pricing risk.
The Companys investments in its directly-held subsidiaries are in sterling and are held at historic cost.
It has indirect exposure to foreign exchange and pricing risk in the Group which could result in the impairment of these subsidiaries.
There are currently sufficient resources in subsidiaries to absorb any normal market events.
