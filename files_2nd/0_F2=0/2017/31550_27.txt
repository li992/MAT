In addition, we participate in two multiemployer defined benefit pension plans in the UK, the British Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund registration number 10005645 MNOPF, which is divided into two sections, the New Section and the Old Section and the British Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund registration number 10005646 MNRPF.
Collectively, we refer to these as the multiemployer plans.
The multiemployer plans are maintained for the benefit of the employees of the participating employers who make contributions to the plans.
However, contributions made by employers, including us, may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, and if any of the participating employers withdraw from the multiemployer plans or fail to make their required contributions, any unfunded obligations would be the responsibility of the remaining participating employers.
We are contractually obligated to make all required contributions as determined by the plans trustees.
All of our multiemployer plans are closed to new membership and future benefit accrual.
The MNOPF Old Section is fully funded.
We expense our portion of the MNOPF New Section deficit as amounts are invoiced by, and become due and payable to, the trustees.
We accrue and expense our portion of the MNRPF deficit based on our estimated probable obligation from the most recent actuarial review.
Total expense for all defined benefit pension plans, including the multiemployer plans, was $53 million in 2017, $27 million in 2016 and $47 million in 2015.
Based on the most recent valuation at March 31, 2015 of the MNOPF New Section, it was determined that this plan was 90% funded.
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our contributions to the MNOPF New Section did not exceed 5% of total contributions to the fund.
Based on the most recent valuation at March 31, 2014 of the MNRPF, it was determined that this plan was 67% funded.
In 2017 and 2016, our contributions to the MNRPF did not exceed 5% of total contributions to the fund.
In 2015, our contributions to the MNRPF exceeded 5% of total contributions to the fund.
It is possible that we will be required to fund and expense additional amounts for the multiemployer plans in the future: however, such amounts are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
The trustee has carried out a triennial valuation at March 31, 2017 and consulted with employers on it but the valuation has not yet been finalized.
 We have several defined contribution plans available to most of our employees.
We contribute to these plans based on employee contributions, salary levels and length of service.
Total expense for these plans was $37 million in 2017 and $30 million in 2016 and 2015.
In addition, cash paid for income taxes, net of recoveries, was $43 million in 2017, $48 million in 2016 and $40 million in 2015.
