During October 2016, following the sale of the Gas Distribution business, the company sold 78 surplus land sites to a number of fellow National Grid Group undertakings, recognising a gain on disposal of 109 million.
A legal agreement was entered into with these National Grid Gas Group companies to demolish the non-operational gas holders on these sites, creating a constructive obligation for the Company.
As a result a provision of 107 million has been recognised at 31 March 2017.
Environmental provision The environmental provision represents the estimated restoration and remediation costs relating to old gas manufacturing sites owned by the Company discounted using a real rate of 1.0%.
Cash flows are expected to be incurred between 2017 and 2077.
A number of uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact the calculation of the provision.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2017 was 27m 2016:87m, being the undiscounted best estimate of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.
Restructuring provision The restructuring provision principally related to business reorganisation costs and is expected to be incurred until 2019.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation comprises: 2017 2016 m m Accelerated capital allowances 382 1,641 Other timing differences 3 18 379 1,623 Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2017 include 134m 2016: nil in respect of business set up costs and business restructuring costs.
We expect the majority of this provision to be utilised within one year.
