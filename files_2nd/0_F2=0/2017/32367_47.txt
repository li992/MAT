Not all of the Groups accounting policies require the directors to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
Any estimates and judgements made are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Although these estimates are based on the directors best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The following is intended to provide an understanding of the policies that management consider critical because of the level ofcomplexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the financial statements.
significant judgements: recognition of sales and purchases of property The Group recognises sales and purchases of property when the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the new owner.
Whilst in most instances this assessment is straightforward, arrangements such as forward sales, significant levels of deferred consideration or transactions with other complex arrangements require the directors to exercise judgement in recognising the transaction.
Key source of estimation uncertainty: property portfolio valuation The valuation to assess the fair value of the Groups investment properties is prepared by its external valuer.
The valuation is based upon a number of assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, future development costs and an appropriate discount rate.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
For the current year and prior year the directors adopted the valuation without adjustment, further information is provided in the accounting policy for investment property and note 10.
