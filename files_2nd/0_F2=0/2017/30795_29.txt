Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2017 1.
General information Savills plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group is a global real estate services Group.
The Group operates through a network of offices in the UK, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Africa and the Middle East.
Savills is listed on the London Stock Exchange and employs 34,429 staff worldwide.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is 33 Margaret Street, London W1G 0JD.
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 14 March 2018.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated, and are also applicable to the parent Company.
2.1 Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and for management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 5.
2.2 Use of non-GAAP measures The Group believes that the consistent presentation of underlying profit before tax, underlying effective tax rate, underlying basic earnings per share and underlying diluted earnings per share provides additional useful information to shareholders on the underlying trends and comparable performance of the Group over time.
The underlying measures are also used by Savills for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
All the adjustments made to the GAAP measures are considered exceptional and or non-operational in nature.
These terms are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly-titled profit measures reported by other companies.
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures.
The term underlying refers to the relevant measure of profit, earnings or taxation being reported excluding the impact pre and post-tax where applicable of the following items: amortisation of acquired intangible assets excluding software : the difference between IFRS 2 charges related to outstanding bonus-related deferred share awards and the estimated value of the current year bonus pool expected to be allocated to deferred share awards refer to Note 8 for further explanation : items that are considered exceptional by size or nature including restructuring costs, impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and investments and profits or losses arising on disposals of subsidiaries and other investments: and significant acquisition costs related to business combinations.
The underlying effective tax rate represents the underlying income tax expense expressed as a percentage of underlying profit before tax.
The underlying income tax expense is the income tax expense excluding the tax effect of the adjustments made to arrive at underlying profit before tax and other tax effects related to these adjustments.
Underlying basic earnings per share and underlying diluted earnings per share both utilise the underlying profit after tax measure instead of GAAP earnings.
The weighted average number of shares remain the same as the GAAP measure.
A reconciliation between GAAP and underlying measures are set out in Note 8 underlying profit before tax and Note 14.2 underlying basic earnings per share and underlying diluted earnings per share.
The Group also refers to revenue and underlying profit on a constant currency basis which are both non-GAAP measures.
Constant currency results are calculated by translating the current year revenue and underlying profit using the prior year exchange rates.
Thismeasure allows the Group to assess the results of the current year compared to the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign currencymovements.

Accounting policies continued 2.3 Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, together with the Groups share of results of its associates and joint ventures.
a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
b Acquisition of subsidiaries The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an  basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration only applies to situations where contingent payments are not dependent on future employment of vendors.
Payments dependent on future employment are expensed to the income statement over the relevant period of employment as required by IFRS 3 revised.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in profit or loss.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
c Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners.
The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
d Disposal of subsidiaries When the Group ceases to control any retained interest in a subsidiary, the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
e Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investors share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition.
The Groups investment in associates includes goodwill net of any accumulated impairment loss identified on acquisition see Note 17.1.
The Groups share of its associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment.
Dividends received or receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The carrying amount of associates is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in Note 2.9.
Savills plc 92 Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements f Joint arrangements The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements.
Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investors share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition.
The Groups share of its joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment.
Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the joint ventures, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint ventures.
Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The carrying amount of joint ventures is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in Note 2.9.
2.4 Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Group Executive Board.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
As the Group is strongly affected by both differences in the types of services it provides and the geographical areas in which it operates, the matrix approach of disclosing both the business and geographical segments format is used.
Revenues and expenses are allocated to segments on the basis that they are directly attributable or the relevant portion can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
2.5 Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is also the Companys functional and presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are recognised in the income statement, except for available-for-sale equity investments, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
c Group entities The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the foreign exchange reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the foreign exchange reserve is transferred to the income statement.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Savills plc 93 Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.6 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to acquisition.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Provision for depreciation is made at rates calculated on a straight-line basis to write-off the assets over their estimated useful lives asfollows: Freehold property 50 years Short leasehold property less than 50 years Over unexpired term of lease Equipment and motor vehicles 310 years Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
2.7 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate over the Groups share of the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.
In respect of associates, goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each business segment in the geographical region in which it operates Note 15.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
2.8 Intangible assets other than goodwill Intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations and incremental contract costs are valued at fair value on acquisition and amortised over the useful life.
Fair value on acquisition is determined by third party valuation where the acquisition is significant.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met: it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use: management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it: there is an ability to use or sell the software product: it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits: adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available: and the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Measurement subsequent to initial recognition is at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Savills plc 94 Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Amortisation charges are spread on a straight-line basis over the period of the assets estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 315 years Order backlogs 2 years Contracts investment, property management and other existing business contracts 220 years Brands 2 years Computer software 35 years Acquired investment management contracts relating to open-ended funds have been attributed indefinite useful lives, reflecting the openended nature of the funds, the Groups intention to continue with the management of the funds for the foreseeable future and the expectation that these contracts are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group for this foreseeable period.
2.9 Impairment of other non-financial assets Assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested annually for impairment or whenever an indicator of impairment exists.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever an indicator of impairment exists.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the assets fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use.
Prior impairments of non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
Value-in-use is determined using the discounted cash flow method, with an appropriate discount rate to reflect market rates and specific risks associated with the asset.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
2.10 Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups statement of financial position at fair value when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Subsequent measurement depends on the classification and is discussed in paragraphs 2.112.16.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the assets carrying amount and the sum of consideration received is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.
2.11 Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income.
When such investments are disposed or become impaired, the accumulated gains and losses, previously recognised in other comprehensive income, are recognised in the income statement.
2.12 Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Receivables are discounted where the time value of money is material.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within other operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is uncollected, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other operating expenses in the income statement.
Savills plc 95 Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.13 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call with banks, together with other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and working capital overdrafts, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are included under borrowings in the statement of financial position.
2.14 Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
2.15 Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
2.16 Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
In these cases, changes in the fair value of all derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
2.17 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
When share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a charge to equity.
Repurchased shares which are not cancelled, or shares purchased for the Employee Benefit Trust, are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
2.18 Taxation The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill: deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Savills plc 96 Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2.19 Pension obligations The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors, such as age, years of service and compensation.
The asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows.
The defined benefit scheme charge consists of net interest costs, past service costs and the impact of any settlements or curtailments and is charged as an expense as they fall due.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan for new entrants and a number of defined contribution individual pension plans.
Contributions in respect of defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement when they are payable.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The net defined benefit cost is allocated amongst participating Group subsidiaries on the basis of pensionable salaries.
2.20 Share-based payments The Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
All equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is predominantly measured by use of the Actuarial Binomial option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Any cash proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
2.21 Employee Benefit Trust and Savills Rabbi Trust The Company has established the Savills plc 1992 Employee Benefit Trust the EBT and the Savills Rabbi Trust the Rabbi Trust, the purposes of which are to grant awards to employees, to acquire shares in the Company pursuant to the Savills Deferred Share Bonus Plan and the Savills Deferred Share Plan and to hold shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to employees on the vesting of the awards granted under the schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the EBT and Rabbi Trust are included in the Group statement of financial position.
Investments in the Groups own shares are shown as a deduction from equity.
2.22 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
a Professional indemnity claims Provisions on professional indemnity claims are recognised when it is probable that the Group will be required to settle claims against it as a result of a past event and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
The Group recognises a provision up to the limit of its self-insured liabilities in respect of any claim, with the excess of any self-insured element settled by professional indemnity insurance cover.
The professional indemnity insurance cover is spread across a panel of insurers so that it is highly unlikely that the Group would be liable for any settlement in excess of the self-insured element of any given claim.
As a result, the amount of the claim in excess of the self-insured element is not included in the professional indemnity claims provision.
Savills plc 97 Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 2.
Accounting policies continued b Dilapidation provisions The Group is required to perform dilapidation repairs and restore properties to agreed specifications on leased properties prior to the properties being vacated at the end of their lease term.
Provision for such cost is made where a legal obligation is identified and the liability can be reasonably quantified.
c Onerous leases A provision is recognised where the costs of meeting the obligations under a lease contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received and is measured as the net least cost of exiting the contract, being the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from the failure to fulfil it.
d Restructuring provision A provision is recognised when there is a present constructive obligation to meet the costs of restructure.
This arises when there is a detailed formal plan for the restructuring, identifying at least the business or part of the business concerned, principal locations affected and the location, function and approximate number of employees to be compensated for terminating their services and when the plan has been communicated to those affected by it, raising an expectation that the plan will be carried out.
2.23 Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Revenue is shown net of value-added tax and amounts due to third parties and after elimination of revenue within the Group.
a Residential transactional fees Generally, where contracts are unconditional, revenue is recognised on exchange of contracts.
However, for new home developments revenue is recognised on a staged basis, following the terms of the contract, to reflect the Groups obligations to find a buyer and to further support the client after exchange of contracts through to completion of the build and contract, which can be a number of years later.
For these developments, revenue recognition commences when the underlying contracts are exchanged, with total revenue from the contract recognised by the date of completion.
b Commercial transactional fees Generally, revenue is recognised on the date of completion or when unconditional contracts have been exchanged.
c Property consultancy Revenue in respect of property consultancy represents commissions and fees recognised on a time basis, fixed fee or percentage of completion.
Percentage of completion is principally measured by the proportion of actual costs incurred in relation to the best estimate of total costs expected for completion of the contract.
d Property and facilities management Revenue represents fees earned for managing properties and providing facilities and is generally recognised in the period the services are provided using a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
e Investment management Revenue represents commissions and fees receivable, net of marketing costs in accordance with the relevant fee agreements.
Annual management fees are recognised, gross of costs, in the period to which the service has been provided, in accordance with the contracted fee agreements.
Transaction fees are recognised on the date of completion of a purchase or sale transaction.
Distribution fees are recognised on the completion of a signed subscription agreement and performance fees are recognised as earned and when approved by the fund.
f Work in progress Work in progress generally relates to consultancy revenue and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes an appropriate proportion of overheads.
g Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
h Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
i Other income Other income includes interest and dividend income on available-for-sale investments plus fair value gains and losses on assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Savills plc 98 Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2.24 Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as financeleases.
Finance lease assets are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease.
The assets are then depreciated over the lower of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives of theassets.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases are included as liabilities in the statement of financial position.
Leasing payments comprise capital and finance elements and the finance element is charged to the income statement.
The annual payments under all other lease agreements operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into the operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
A lease is classified as onerous where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
2.25 Dividends Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
2.26 Adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations to standards Standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the EU and mandatorily effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017 that are not relevant or considered to have a significant impact on the Group and its financial statements include the following: Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses The following standards and amendments to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and have not been early adopted: IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15, including amendments, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard establishes a principles based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of goods or services is transferred.
It applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards.
It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under the current accounting standards.
The implementation of IFRS 15 will result in some refinement in the timing of recognition of investment management performance fees and the amortisation period for contract costs however the impact of this refinement is not material.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments, including amendments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
This standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit and loss.
The basis of classification depends on the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39.
For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
The Groups available-for-sale investments will be renamed in accordance with IFRS 9, with the only change in accounting treatment being that fair value re-measurements in reserves will not be recycled to the income statement upon disposal of the investment.
Otherwise, the application of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16, Leases, effective for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of leases with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that faithfully represents those transactions.
The standard supersedes IAS 17 Leases.
The standard is expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
On adoption, lease agreements will give rise to both a right of use asset and a lease liability for future lease payables.
Depreciation of the right of use asset will be recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis, with interest recognised on the lease liability.
This will result in a change to the profile of the net charge taken to the income statement over the life of the lease.
These charges will replace the lease costs currently charged to the income statement.
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16, however, the impact will greatly depend on the facts and circumstances at the time of adoption and upon transition choices adopted.
It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Groups consolidated results.
Other standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not discussed above are not relevant or considered significant to the Group.
Savills plc 99 Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 3.
Financial risk management 3.1 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.
The Group uses financial instruments to manage material foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The treasury function is responsible for implementing risk management policies applied by the Group and has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
3.2 Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risks primarily with respect to the euro, Hong Kong dollar and US dollar.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
When there is a material committed foreign currency exposure the foreign exchange risk will be hedged.
The Group may finance some overseas investments through the use of foreign currency borrowings.
The Group does not actively seek to hedge risks arising from foreign currency translations due to their non-cash nature and the high costs associated with such hedging.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared for the major currencies to which the Group is exposed.
Recent historical movements in these currencies has been considered and it has been concluded that a 510% movement in rates is a reasonable benchmark.
For the years ended 31 December, if the average currency conversion rates against sterling for the year had changed with all other variables held constant, the Group post-tax profit for the year would have increased or decreased as shown below: Movement of currency against sterling m -10.0% -5.0% 5.0% 10.0% 2017 Estimated impact on post-tax profit Euro 1.0 0.5 0.6 1.2 Hong Kong dollar 1.5 0.8 0.9 1.8 US dollar 0.9 0.5 0.5 1.1 Estimated impact on components of equity Euro 1.0 0.5 0.6 1.2 Hong Kong dollar 12.3 6.5 7.1 15.1 US dollar 12.1 6.3 7.0 14.8 2016 Estimated impact on post-tax profit Euro 1.3 0.7 0.7 1.5 Hong Kong dollar 0.5 0.3 0.3 0.6 US dollar 0.8 0.4 0.4 0.9 Estimated impact on components of equity Euro 1.1 0.5 0.6 1.3 Hong Kong dollar 13.7 7.2 7.9 16.7 US dollar 11.4 6.0 6.6 13.9 Savills plc 100 Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 3.3 Interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings, at both fixed and floating interest rates.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group cash flow to interest rate risk, which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain at least 70% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, if the average interest rate for the year had changed with all other variables held constant, the Groups post-tax profit for the year and equity would have increased or decreased as shown below: Increase in interest rates m 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2017 Estimated impact on post-tax profit and equity 0.3 0.6 1.0 1.4 2016 Estimated impact on post-tax profit and equity 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 Decrease in interest rates m -0.5% -1.0% -1.5% -2.0% 2017 Estimated impact on post-tax profit and equity 0.5 0.9 0.9 0.6 2016 Estimated impact on post-tax profit and equity 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.2 The rationale behind the 2.0% sensitivity analysis is based upon historic trends in interest rate movements and the short-term expectation that any increase or decrease greater than 2.0% is unlikely to occur.
3.4 Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to clients, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before engaging with them.
A risk control framework is used to assess the credit quality of clients, taking into account financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits for banks and financial institutions are set based on external ratings and in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
As at the reporting date, no significant credit risk existed in relation to banking counterparties.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting year, and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
There were no other significant receivables or individual trade receivable balances as at 31 December 2017.
Refer to Note 19 for information on the credit quality of trade receivables and the maximum exposure to credit risk arising on outstanding receivables from clients.

Financial risk management continued 3.5 Liquidity risk The Group maintains appropriate committed facilities to ensure the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and expansion.
The Group prepares an annual funding plan approved by the Board which sets out the Groups expected financing requirements for the next 12 months.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn borrowing facilities Note 22 and cash and cash equivalents Note 20 on the basis of expected cash flow.
This is carried out at local level in the operating companies of the Group in accordance with Group practice as well as on a Group consolidated basis.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date.

The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2016.
Savills plc is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements, with the exception of its regulated entities within the Savills Investment Management group and its FCA Financial Conduct Authority regulated entity, Savills Capital Advisors Ltd, in the UK.
All regulated entities complied with the relevant capital requirements during the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Savills Investment Management group has regulated entities in the UK, Jersey, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and the US.
For more information on Savills Investment Management groups regulated entities and regulatory requirements, please visit www.
In order to maintain an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Board has put in place a distribution policy which takes into account the degree of maintainability of the Groups different profit streams and the Groups overall exposure to cyclical Transaction Advisory profits, as well as the requirement to maintain a certain level of cash resources for working capital and corporate development purposes.
The Board will recommend an ordinary dividend broadly reflecting the profits derived from the Groups less volatile businesses.
In addition, when profits from the cyclical Transaction Advisory business are strong, the Board will consider and, if appropriate, recommend the payment of a supplemental dividend alongside the final ordinary dividend.
The value of any such supplemental dividend will vary depending on the performance of the Groups Transaction Advisory business and the Groups anticipated working capital and corporate development requirements through the cycle.
It is intended that, in normal circumstances, the combined value of the ordinary and supplemental dividends declared in respect of any year are covered at least 1.5 times by statutory retained earnings and or at least 2.0 times by underlying profits after taxation.
The Group complied with this policy throughout the year.
Savills plc 102 Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Groups policy is to borrow centrally, if required, to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are then on-lent or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries.
The Board of Directors monitors a number of debt measures on a rolling forward 12-month basis including: gross cash by location: gross debt by location: cash subject to restrictions: total debt servicing cost to operating profit: gross borrowings as a percentage of EBITDA earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation : and forecast headroom against available facilities.
These internal measures indicate the levels of debt that the Group has and are closely monitored to ensure compliance with banking covenants and to confirm that the Group has sufficient unused facilities.
The Group complied with all banking covenants throughout the year and met all internal counterparty exposure limits set by the Board.
The capital structure is as follows: Group Company m 2017 2016 2017 2016 Equity 441.7 407.0 216.7 205.0 Cash and cash equivalents 208.8 223.6 90.8 88.3 Bank overdrafts 3.6 0.2 Borrowings 106.6 35.6 Net cash 98.6 187.8 90.8 88.3 3.7 Categories of financial instruments  Total for-sale Total Financial financial Loans and carrying Financial financial Loans and carrying asset at fair assets receivables amount asset at fair assets receivables amount value 2017 2017 2017 2017 value 2016 2016 2016 2016 m m m m m m m m Financial assets: Available-for-sale investments 24.6 24.6 20.8 20.8 Trade and other receivables 440.0 440.0 363.0 363.0 Derivative financial instruments 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.2 Cash and cash equivalents 208.8 208.8 223.6 223.6 Total financial assets 0.5 24.6 648.8 673.9 0.2 20.8 586.6 607.6 Financial Financial Total Financial Financial Total liabilities at liabilities at carrying liabilities at liabilities at carrying fair value amortised amount fair value amortised amount 2017 cost 2017 2017 2016 cost 2016 2016 m m m m m m Financial liabilities: Borrowings 110.2 110.2 35.8 35.8 Trade and other payables 573.6 573.6 542.7 542.7 Derivative financial instruments 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 Total financial liabilities 0.1 683.8 683.9 0.3 578.5 578.8 Savills plc 103 Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2017 3.

The fair value of unlisted available-for-sale investments is determined using valuation techniques using observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on entity estimates.
The fair value of investment funds is based on underlying asset values determined by the Fund Managers audited annual financial statements.
The fair value of other unlisted investments is based on price earnings models.
These instruments are included in Level 2.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by using valuation techniques using observable market data.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on the market value of similar instruments with similar maturities.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
The Group has no Level 3 instruments.

Critical accounting estimates and management judgements 5.1 Accounting estimates Estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, current market conditions and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information or more experience.
The estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a Pension benefits The present value of the defined benefit pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions including the discount rate.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
Additional information is disclosed in Note 10.2. b Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
c Deferred taxes The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, especially with regard to the extent that future taxable profits will be available against which losses can be utilised.
d Valuation of intangible assets and useful life The Group has made assumptions in relation to the potential future cash flows to be determined from separable intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations.
This assessment involves assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount rates and the useful life of such assets.
These assumptions impact the income statement over the useful life of the intangible asset.
e Provisions The Group and its subsidiaries are party to various legal claims.
Provisions made within these financial statements and further details are contained in Note 24.1.
Additional claims could be made which might not be covered by existing provisions or by insurance as detailed in Note 28.
5.2 Management judgements In the course of preparing the financial statements, no judgements have been made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, other than those involving estimations, that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

Segment analysis Operating segments reflect internal management reporting to the Groups chief operating decision maker, defined as the Group Executive Board GEB.
The operating segments are determined based on differences in the nature of their services.
Geographical location also strongly affects the Group and both are therefore disclosed.
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from property-related services.
Refer to the Group overview on page 3 and the segmental reviews on pages 18 to 21 for further information on revenue sources.
Operations are based in four main geographical areas.
The UK is the home of the parent Company with segment operations throughout the region.
Asia Pacific segment operations are based in Hong Kong, Macau, China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar.
Continental Europe segment operations are based in Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Ireland, Poland and Czech Republic.
North America segment operations are based in a number of states throughout the US and in Canada.
The sales location of the client is not materially different from the location where fees are received and where the segment assets are located.
Within the UK, both commercial and residential services are provided.
Other geographical areas, although largely commercial-based, also provide residential services, in particular Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Thailand.
The GEB assesses the performance of operating segments based on a measure of underlying profit before tax which adjusts reported pre-tax profit by profit loss on disposals, share-based payment adjustment, significant restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs, amortisation of acquired intangible assets excluding software and impairments.
Segmental assets and liabilities are not measured or reported to the GEB, but non-current assets are disclosed geographically on page 107.

The annual bonus is paid in a mixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another.
Under IFRS, the deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year.
The adjustment above addresses this by adding to or deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge in relation to outstanding bonusrelated share awards and the estimated value of the current year bonus pool to be awarded in deferred shares.
This adjustment is made to align the underlying staff cost in the year with the revenue recognised in the same period.
An impairment charge of 2.3m was recognised in the year relating to the goodwill of the Groups Swedish property management business.
Refer to Note 15 for further details.
Profit on disposal includes profits recognised in relation to the disposals of the Groups available-for-sale investments, SPF Private Clients Limited 5.3m and Cordea Savills German Retail Fund 0.6m.
Restructuring costs includes costs of integration activities in relation to recent significant business acquisitions primarily GBR Phoenix Beard and Smiths Gore in the UK and Savills Investment Managements acquisition of SEB.
Acquisition-related costs include 10.2m of provisions for the future payments in relation to the acquisition of Studley, Inc. which are expensed through the income statement to reflect the requirement for the recipients to remain actively engaged in the business at the payment date.
Acquisition-related costs also include 1.4m for payments in relation to Savills Investment Managements acquisition of Merchant Capital Japan in May 2014, 2.1m of transaction related costs primarily Aguirre Newman and Larry Smith and 7.6m of provisions for future payments relating to acquisitions in the UK primarily GBR Phoenix Beard and Smiths Gore and North America.

The total pension charges in respect of these plans were 26.9m 2016: 23.0m.
The amount outstanding as at 31 December 2017 in relation to defined contribution schemes is 1.9m 2016: 1.5m.
10.2 Defined benefit plan The Group operates two defined benefit plans.
The Pension Plan of Savills the UK Plan is a UK-based plan which provided final salary pension benefits to some employees, but was closed with regard to future service-based benefit accrual with effect from 31 March 2010.
From 1 April 2010, pension benefits for former employees of the UK Plan are provided through the Groups defined contribution Personal Pension Plan.
The UK Plan is administered by a separate Trust that is legally separated from the Company.
The board of the pension fund is composed of six trustees.
The board of the pension fund is required by law and by its Article of Association to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The board of the pension fund is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan was carried out as at 31 March 2016 and has been updated to 31 December 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Savills Fund Management GMBH Plan the SFM Plan is a Germany-based plan which provides final salary benefits to 17 active employees and 97 former employees.
The plan is closed to future service-based benefit accrual.
The SFM Plan is administered by an external Trust that is legally separated from the Company.
The Trust Agreement requires the trustee to maintain the plan assets in the interest of the beneficiaries of the plan and to fulfil their pension entitlements in the event of insolvency to the extent of the plan assets held.
The Investment Committee of the fund, advised by expert investment managers, is responsible for the investment policy with regards to the assets of the fund.
The contributions are determined based on the annual valuations of an independent qualified actuary.
A full actuarial valuation of the SFM Plan was carried out as at 31 December 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.

Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business neither Trustor nor Trustee have any rights to unilaterally wind up, or otherwise augment the benefits due to members of the scheme.
Based on these rights, any net surplus in the scheme is recognised in full.

Pension schemes continued 10.2 Defined benefit plan continued Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 60: SFM Plan UK Plan 2017 2016 2017 2016 Retiring at the end of the reporting year Male 83.9 84.1 88.8 88.7 Female 88.4 88.2 90.3 90.3 Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year Male 86.6 86.5 91.0 90.9 Female 91.0 90.8 92.7 92.7 The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions is: SFM Plan UK Plan Impact on present value of Impact on present value of scheme obligations m scheme obligations m 0.1% increase in discount rates 0.2 7.1 0.1% increase in inflation rate 0.2 4.0 0.1% increase in salary increase rate 0.7 1 year increase in life expectancy 0.6 11.6 The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets.
Although the UK Plan does not invest directly in the Groups financial instruments, it does invest in passive equity funds, so will have some exposure to FTSE All Share, hence indirectly to the Savills share price.
Savills plc 114 Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Through the defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: a Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Plan holds a significant proportion of equities and investment funds, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
b Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plans liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans bond holdings.
c Inflation risk Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Plans assets are either unaffected by or are loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
d Life expectancy The majority of the Plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plans liabilities.
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending 31 December 2018 are 9.0m.
The Company expects to contribute 0.5m.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 22 years for the UK Plan and 18 years for the SFM Plan.

Earnings per share 14.1 Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS are based on the profit attributable to owners of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding the shares held by the EBT, 4,819,684 shares 2016: 5,706,307 shares and the Rabbi Trust, 800,000 shares 2016: nil.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being the share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and where performance conditions have been met.
The earnings and the shares used in the calculations are as follows: 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 Earnings Shares EPS Earnings Shares EPS m million pence m million pence Basic earnings per share 80.1 136.2 58.8 66.9 137.2 48.8 Effect of additional shares issuable under option 3.0 1.3 3.0 1.1 Diluted earnings per share 80.1 139.2 57.5 66.9 140.2 47.7 14.2 Underlying basic and diluted earnings per share Excludes profit on disposals, share-based payment adjustment, impairment and amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets excluding software, impairment of available-for-sale investment and associate undertaking and restructuring costs.

The adjustment for share-based payment relates to the impact of the accounting standard for share-based compensation.
Under IFRS the deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year.
The adjustment above addresses this by adding to or deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge and the effective value of the annual share award in order to better match the underlying staff costs in the year with the revenue recognised in the same period.
The gross amounts of the above adjustments Note 8 are amortisation of acquired intangible assets excluding software 3.9m 2016: 4.0m, impairment of goodwill of 2.3m 2016: nil, share-based payment adjustment 1.2m credit 2016: 2.4m credit, restructuring costs of 7.7m 2016: 5.8m, net profit on disposals of 5.9m 2016: 0.1m, acquisition-related costs of 21.3m 2016: 28.7m.

Goodwill and intangible assets continued During the year, goodwill and intangible assets were tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
Goodwill and intangible assets are allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.
In most cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation and these have been separately assessed and tested.
A segment-level summary of the allocation of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets is presented below: Property and Transaction Facilities Investment Advisory Consultancy Management Management Total 2017 m m m m m United Kingdom 26.0 9.3 27.4 2.0 64.7 Continental Europe 59.6 16.2 8.7 5.2 89.7 Asia Pacific 15.1 4.7 30.6 2.3 52.7 North America 147.4 147.4 Total goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 248.1 30.2 66.7 9.5 354.5 Property Transaction and Facilities Investment Advisory Consultancy Management Management Total 2016 m m m m m United Kingdom 26.0 9.3 26.2 2.0 63.5 Continental Europe 32.6 6.0 5.1 43.7 Asia Pacific 15.8 5.0 30.6 2.4 53.8 North America 152.2 152.2 Total goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 226.6 14.3 62.8 9.5 313.2 15.1 Method of impairment testing All recoverable amounts were determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a terminal value.
There was a 2.3m impairment charge recognised against goodwill and intangible assets arising from the annual impairment tests conducted 2016: nil.
15.2 Assumptions a Market conditions In general, the models used assume that the property markets in which the Group operates which drive its revenue growth will remain stable.
b Discount rate The discount rate applied to cash flows of each CGU is based on the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
WACC is the average cost of sources of financing debt and equity, each of which is weighted by its respective use.
Key inputs to the WACC calculation are the risk-free rate, the equity market risk premium the return that Savills shares provide over the risk-free rate, beta reflecting the risk of the Group relative to the market as a whole and the Groups borrowing rates.
Group WACC was adjusted for risk relative to the country in which the assets were located.
The risk-adjusted discount range of rates used in each region for impairment testing are as follows: 2017 2016 Discount rate range Discount rate range United Kingdom 10.0% 10.0% Continental Europe 10.0% 10.0% Asia Pacific 11.2%18.1% 11.6%18.1% North America 10.0% 10.0% Savills plc 120 Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements c Long-term growth rate To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a terminal value was calculated, using average long-term growth rates.
The rates are based on the long-term growth rate in the countries in which the Group operates.
The long-term growth rates used in each region for impairment testing are as follows: 2017 2016 Long-term growth Long-term growth rate range rate range United Kingdom 2.0% 1.5% Continental Europe 1.4%2.6% 1.5% Asia Pacific 0.8%5.7% 0.8%5.7% North America 2.3% 2.3% 15.3 Impairment charge Following impairment testing, a 2.3m charge has been recognised through the income statement 2016: nil relating to goodwill on the Groups Swedish property management business.
The Swedish business operates under the European transactional and property management segments.
Key assumptions of the discounted cash flow analysis are consistent with the above assumptions in Note 15.2.
The residual value of goodwill relating to the Groups Swedish business is not material.
15.4 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is a reflection of best estimates in arriving at value-in-use, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
Nonetheless, there are no CGUs for which management considers a reasonable possible change in a key assumption would give rise to an impairment apart from the Groups Swedish business, which was partially impaired during the year.
Future impairments on goodwill and intangible assets relating to any of the Groups investments may be impacted by the following factors: Market conditions the expectations for future market conditions are key assumptions in the determination of the cash flow projections.
For the purposes of the impairment tests, management expects the markets to remain stable.
Cost base the cost base assumptions reflect 2017s costs with limited growth in the fixed cost base going forward.
