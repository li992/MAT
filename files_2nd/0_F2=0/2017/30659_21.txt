Where relevant, these are prepared in accordance with guidance from the AIC and this glossary provides additional information in relation to them.
Alternative performance measures APMs : APMs are numerical measures of the Companys current, historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, other than financial measures defined or specified in the applicable financial framework.
The Companys applicable financial framework includes IFRSs and the AIC SORP.
Gearing: Gearing is a measure of the level of debt deployed within the portfolio.
The disclosed ratio is calculated in accordance with AIC guidance as total assets, net of cash, divided by net assets with debt included at par value.
NAV per share and share price total returns: The total return for a period represents the change in either NAV per share diluted and with debt at fair value or the share price, adjusted to reflect dividends paid during the period.
The calculation assumes the dividends are notionally reinvested in the month-end NAV or daily closing share price, following the shares going ex-dividend.
Ongoing charges figure: As a self-managed investment trust with operating subsidiaries, the calculation of the Companys OCF requires adjustments to the total operating expenses.
In accordance with AIC guidance, the main adjustments are to remove the costs incurred by GVQ which has its own AUM and to remove direct performance-related compensation from JRCM, which is analogous to a performance fee for externally managed trusts.
