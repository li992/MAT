Notes to the Company financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2017 143.
135BSignificant accounting policies a Basis of accounting The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by company law.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, presentation of a cash flow statement, impairment of assets, standards not yet effective, and related party transactions.
Where relevant, equivalent disclosures have been given in the Group accounts.
As more fully detailed in the Directors report, the Companys financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
b Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the investments recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is charged to the profit and loss account, net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based upon tax rates and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Financial instruments Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the profit and loss account where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables are measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
170 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1343.
137BSignificant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Company operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo models and the corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of nonmarket based vesting conditions.
Save As You Earn SAYE options are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme, resulting in an acceleration of the remainder of the related expense.
Options over the Companys shares awarded to employees of the Companys subsidiaries are accounted for as a capital contribution within the carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings.
Pensions The Company participates in the Mitie Group plc defined benefit Pension Scheme.
All group companies account for the contributions to the defined benefit scheme in respect of their employees and as part of a group arrangement one of the Companys subsidiaries accounts for the other costs, income, assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Note 38 to the consolidated financial statements sets out details of the IAS 19 Employee Benefits net pension liability of the scheme amounting to 70.7m 2016: 34.4m.
c Prior year restatements During the year there was an apparent significant shortfall in the expected profitability of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2017.
New executive directors were appointed in December and January and they immediately launched an accounting review process to provide confidence that all relevant accounting standards were appropriately reflected in the Groups financial reporting.
Following additional information becoming available, the review work identified a number of prior year errors that, due to their materiality, require the restatement of the results for the year ended 31 March 2016, as well as the consolidated balance sheet positions as at 31 March 2016 and at 31 March 2015.
In respect of the Company, these prior year restatements relate to the under accrual of costs.
