Notes to the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS financial statements 19.
Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic bene ts associated with the item will ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
At each balance sheet date the assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, including assessing for indicators of impairment.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are included in the income statement.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land and buildings comprise mainly branches and of ces.
Freehold land is not depreciated although it is subject to impairment testing.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Buildings up to 50 years Leasehold improvements life of lease up to 50 years Equipment and motor vehicles three to 15 years Aircraft up to 18 years Ships up to 15 years Where the Group is a lessee under finance leases, the leased assets are capitalised and included in Property, plant and equipment with a corresponding liability to the lessor recognised in Other liabilities.
Finance charges payable are recognised over the period of the lease based on the interest rate implicit in the lease to give a constant periodic rate of return.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
