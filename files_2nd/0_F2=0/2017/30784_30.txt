M Employee benefits The Company operates two defined benefit pension schemes, being the Clarkson PLC scheme and the Plowrights scheme, which are funded by the payment of contributions to separate trusts administered by Trustees who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
All financial information provided in this note relates to the sum of the two separate schemes.
The schemes assets are invested in a range of pooled pension investment funds managed by professional fund managers.
Defined benefit pension arrangements give rise to open ended commitments and liabilities for the sponsoring company.
As a consequence, the Company closed its original defined benefit section of the Clarkson PLC scheme to new entrants on 31 March 2004.
This section was closed to further accrual for all existing members as from 31 March 2006.
The Plowrights scheme was closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
Every three years, a pension scheme must obtain from an actuary a report containing a valuation and a recommendation on rates of contribution.
Triennial valuations for all the schemes have been prepared.
The valuation of the Clarkson PLC scheme showed a pension surplus of 3.6m as at 31 March 2016.
Clarkson PLC and the Trustees agreed to cease funding with effect from 1 October 2016.
The valuation of the Plowrights scheme showed a pension deficit of 1.2m as at 31 March 2016.
Clarkson PLC and the Trustees agreed to continue the funding plan, at the rate of 0.9m per annum, until 30 September 2017.
The Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
Both schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
134 Clarkson PLC Annual Report 2017 134 CLARKSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Strategic report Governance Other information Other pension arrangements The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
Where required, the Company also makes contributions into this scheme.
The Company incurs no material expenses in the provision of post-retirement benefits other than pensions.
The following tables summarise amounts recognised in the balance sheet and the components of net benefit charge recognised in the income statement: Recognised in the balance sheet 2017 2016 m m Fair value of schemes assets 191.1 189.5 Present value of funded defined benefit obligations 169.1 178.5 22.0 11.0 Effect of asset ceiling minimum funding commitment in relation to the Plowrights scheme 5.3 4.1 Net benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 16.7 6.9 The net benefit asset disclosed above is the combined total of the two schemes.
The Clarkson PLC scheme has a surplus of 16.7m 2016: 7.5m and the Plowrights scheme has a deficit of nil 2016: 0.6m.
As there is no right of set-off between the schemes, the benefit asset of 16.7m 2016: 7.5m is disclosed separately on the balance sheet from the benefit liability of nil 2016: 0.6m.
The surplus in the Clarkson PLC scheme is recognised, as there are future economic benefits available in the form of a reduction in future contributions to the defined contribution section of the scheme.
There are no such future economic benefits in respect of the Plowright Scheme and therefore the surplus of 5.3m 2016: 3.5m cannot be recognised.
In addition, a minimum funding commitment of nil 2016: 0.6 m was recognised as arising from agreed future contributions to the Plowright Scheme.
This is in accordance with the respective Trust Deed and Rules.

136 Clarkson PLC Annual Report 2017 136 CLARKSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Strategic report Governance Other information The principal valuation assumptions are as follows: 2017 2016 % % Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 7.0 3.2 7.0 Price inflation RPI 3.2 3.3 Price inflation CPI 2.2 2.3 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.5 2.7 The mortality assumptions used to assess the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 and 2016 is based on the SAPS Light SAPS for the Stewart scheme standard mortality tables published by the actuarial profession in 2014.
These tables have been adjusted to allow for anticipated future improvements in life expectancy using the standard projection model published in 2016 31 December 2016: model published in 2015.
Examples of the assumed future life expectancy are given in the table below: Additional years 2017 2016 Post-retirement life expectancy on retirement at age 65: Pensioners retiring in the year male 23.1 23.1 female 24.2 24.3 Pensioners retiring in 20 years time male 24.5 24.5 female 25.7 25.8 Experience adjustments 2017 2016 m m Experience gain on schemes assets 9.4 29.2 Gain on schemes liabilities due to changes in demographic assumptions 0.2 13.9 Gain loss on schemes liabilities due to changes in financial assumptions 0.5 37.5 Experience gains on schemes liabilities 3.9 Loss on asset ceiling minimum funding commitment 1.1 2.6 Total actuarial gain 9.0 6.9 Sensitivities The table below shows the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions.
The impact of changes to each assumption is shown in isolation although, in practice, changes to assumptions may occur at the same time and can either offset or compound the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation.
A change of 0.25% is deemed appropriate given the movement in assumptions in the year.
The sensitivities have been calculated using the same methodology as the main calculations.
The weighted average duration of the defined obligation is 17 years.
Change in Change in defined benefit assumption obligation Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.25% -3.9% -0.25% 4.2% Price inflation RPI 0.25% 3.7% -0.25% -3.5% An increase of one year in the assumed life expectancy for both males and females would increase the defined benefit obligation by 3.8% 2016: 3.8%.
