Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 39 Financial Statements 2017 Operating sustainably Ensuring that our stakeholders share in our success We recognise that being sustainable makes us more efficient, helps us to win work, engages our employees and benefits the communities and environment we work in.
Operating sustainably is a key part of our strategy.
We strategically evaluate the Groups key sustainability risks and opportunities and set targets against the most material issues.
Each of our divisions adheres to these targets, and sets their own additional targets aligned to their respective stakeholders, in a Sustainability Route Map.
The success of our approach is externally recognised through our FTSE4Good Index membership, above industry CDP carbon disclosure score and silver NextGeneration sustainability benchmark awards, among others.

Employees from our Infrastructure Divisional Solutions business unit were encouraged to make voluntary pledges to support our achievement of the divisions sustainability targets.

Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 41 Financial Statements 2017 A new strategy for wellbeing We believe that health should be given the same priority as safety, and in our bid to achieve top-quartile health performance, we are launching a new wellbeing strategy, covering key areas such as stress, mental health and work-life balance.
Rather than mandating what our businesses must do, we provide them with information and challenge them to devise their own wellbeing initiatives.
Our experience of other programmes shows that this personal buy-in approach is more effective than one size fits all.
Examples of our initiatives include bringing in medical professionals to talk about stress, mental health and life outside work, such as responsible Occupational health screening drinking.
This is proving popular with our people.
In the Spring, we trialled a new bespoke occupational health screening programme which has been rolled out across the Group this Summer.
Typical practice is to screen everyone for the same standard conditions, at the same intervals.
Our new risk-based approach is tailored to individuals, not job titles.
For example, it recognises that someone working with vibrating tools should have more regular checks for hand-arm vibration, and that this test might not be so relevant for other individuals.
In addition, we are piloting a health screening audit with the British Occupational Hygiene Society as a critical friend, to ensure our internal processes are robust and fit for purpose in dealing with recognised health and wellbeing issues such as absence management.
