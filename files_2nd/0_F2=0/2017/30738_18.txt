On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, including segmental information, adjusting items, taxation and earnings per share.
You will also find a summary of the Groups alternative performance measures, including the definition of each and the rationale for their use.
2.1 Segmental information and alternative performance measures Organic revenue growth and operating profit are the two short-term key performance indicators or measures that reflect the way the performance of the Group is managed and monitored by the Executive Committee.
In this section the key constituents of these two KPIs, being the Groups adjusted revenues and segmental operating profits, are analysed by reference to the performance and activities of the Groups segments and their operating costs.
1 Segmental information Segmental information is presented in the consolidated financial statements for each of the Groups operating segments.
The operating segment reporting format reflects the Groups management and internal reporting structures and represents the information that was presented to the chief operating decision-maker, being the Executive Committee.
As described on page 09, each of the Groups three divisions has a number of key brands across its main markets and operational locations.
For the purposes of reportable segmental information, operating segments are aggregated into the Groups three divisions, as the nature of the products, production processes and types of customer are similar within each division.

5 Reconciliation of effective tax rate As IMIs head office and parent company is domiciled in the UK, the Group references its effective tax rate to the UK corporation tax rate, despite only a small portion of the Groups business being in the UK.
Therefore, the following tax reconciliation applies the UK corporation tax rate for the year to profit before tax, both before and after adjusting items.
The resulting tax charge is reconciled to the actual tax charge for the Group, by taking account of specific tax adjustments as follows: 2017 2016 Adjusted Adjustments Statutory Adjusted Adjustments Statutory Section m m m m m m Profit before tax from continuing operations 224.1 43.2 180.9 208.0 42.7 165.3 Profit before tax from discontinued operations 2.5 2.2 2.2 - - Profit before tax 224.1 41.0 183.1 208.0 42.7 165.3 Income tax using the Companys domestic rate of tax of 19.25% 2016: 20% 43.1 7.9 35.2 41.6 8.5 33.1 Effects of: Non-deductible items 1.8 3.7 5.5 3.2 0.6 3.8 Non-taxable loss on disposal of businesses - 0.4 0.4 - - Utilisation of losses on which no deferred tax had been recognised 2.6 2.6 1.0 1.0 Current year losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised 6.5 0.4 6.9 3.5 3.5 Change in future tax rate on deferred tax 5.0 5.0 3.0 3.0 Differing tax rates 5.5 4.4 1.1 2.8 3.7 6.5 Over Under provided in prior years 2.2 18.4 20.6 2.2 2.2 Total tax in income statement 47.1 26.2 20.9 43.7 11.6 32.1 Income tax expense reported in the consolidated income statement 47.1 11.5 35.6 43.7 11.6 32.1 Effective rate of tax - continuing operations: 21.0% 19.5% 21.0% 19.4% Income tax attributable to discontinued operations 2.5 14.7 14.7 - - Effective rate of tax - discontinued operations: Total tax in income statement 47.1 26.2 20.9 43.7 11.6 32.1 Effective rate of tax - total Group: 21.0% 11.5% 21.0% 19.4% The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law on 22 December 2017.
The Act lowers the rate of Federal Corporate Income tax from 35% to 21% from 1 January 2018, which will benefit IMI in future years.
Given that the rate change was substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, US deferred tax balances have been measured at a rate of 23% 2016: 37%, reflecting the combined Federal and State Corporate Income tax rates at which they are expected to reverse.
This has resulted in a one off credit in 2017 to the Income Statement of 5m and a charge to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income of 0.3m.
As a result of the OECDs Base Erosion & Profit Shifting BEPS initiative the effective rate of tax on certain intra-group lending has increased in 2017.
With regard to the Groups US businesses this has a broadly equal but opposite effect to the benefits from the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
As a result, the Groups overall adjusted effective rate of tax remains stable.

8 Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets of 49.1m 2016: 56.2m have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of 65.2m 2016: 47.9m, interest of 33.6m 2016: 61.3m and capital losses of 118.4m 2016: 119.1m.
The majority of the tax losses have no expiry date.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for these temporary differences due to the uncertainty over their offset against future taxable profits and therefore their recoverability.
In some instances, these balances are also yet to be accepted by the tax authorities and so could be challenged in the event of an audit.
It is likely that the majority of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption.
However 30.5m 2016: 48.9m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability principally as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 2.5m 2016: 2.9m of which 2.5m 2016: 2.7m has been provided on the basis that the group expects to remit these amounts.
2.5 Discontinued operations When the Group has assets and liabilities that have been sold in the year or are likely to be sold rather than being held for continuing use, these assets and liabilities are included in current assets and liabilities and denoted held for sale rather than in their usual categories.
If they represent a significant enough proportion of the Group, they are also treated as discontinued operations.
This means that their trading performance, i. e. their revenues, costs and other items of income and expense, are no longer reported within the headline figures in the income statement and are instead reported in a separate line, net of tax, called discontinued operations.
These amounts no longer form part of continuing earnings per share.
Comparative figures are restated to be shown on the same basis.
This enables the income statement for the current and prior year to be presented on a consistent basis and to convey a more forward-looking version of the results for the year.
A pre-tax gain of 2.2m and post-tax gain of 16.9m was recognised in the current year as a result of the finalisation of a number of matters relating to historical discontinued operations.
There was no profit or loss from discontinued operations in 2016.
110 IMI plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Section 3 operating assets and liabilities What you will find in this section This section shows the assets used to generate the Groups trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result.
Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in Section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in Section 2.4.
On the following pages there are sections covering working capital, non-current assets, acquisitions, other payables due after more than one year, provisions and pensions.
2 Working capital Trade and other receivables 2017 2016 Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates m m through its trading activities.
The Group therefore defines working capital as trade and other receivables, inventory and trade and other payables.
Working Current capital is managed very carefully to ensure that the Group can meet its trading Trade receivables 339.9 337.0 and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
Other receivables 52.2 42.6 To provide the Executive Committee with insight into the management Prepayments and accrued income 26.7 20.9 of working capital, an important measure monitored is cash conversion.
418.8 400.5 Cash conversion is defined as the operating cash flow as defined in the Receivables are stated after: commentary on the cash flow statement divided by the segmental operating Allowance for impairment 12.5 11.5 profit which therefore represents the proportion of segmental operating profit generated during the year that has been converted into cash.
The increase in the Groups trade and other receivables of 18.3m is due to foreign exchange movements of 8.2m offset by unfavourable cash movements 3.1.
Inventories The Groups exposure to credit and market risks related to trade and other receivables is disclosed in Section 4.4.
3 Raw materials and consumables 79.5 77.0 Trade and other payables Work in progress 113.6 113.9 Finished goods 58.2 64.3 2017 2016 251.3 255.2 m m Inventories are stated after: Current Allowance for impairment 38.2 41.8 Trade payables 222.0 214.2 Social security and other taxation 26.8 22.3 In 2017 the cost of inventories recognised as an expense being segmental Other payables 7.8 23.0 cost of sales amounted to 980.1m 2016: 923.8m.
The Groups inventory Accruals and deferred income 159.9 148.4 decreased by 3.9m due to decreases in inventory held in IMI Critical 416.5 407.9 Engineering and IMI Hydronic Engineering.
Non-current In 2017 the write-down of inventories to net realisable value amounted to Other payables 6.6 10.7 13.4m 2016: 10.6m.
The reversal of write-downs amounted to 6.6m 423.1 418.6 2016: 2.3m.
Write-downs and reversals in both years relate to on-going assessments of inventory obsolescence, excess inventory holding and inventory resale values across all of the Groups businesses.
The Groups trade and other payables increased by 4.5m due to foreign exchange movements of 17.9m, offset by favourable cash movements of 22.4m.
111 3.2 Intangible assets The following section shows the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include goodwill, customer relationships, order books, patents, development costs and software development costs.
The cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has paid for them or, when they have arisen due to a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
In the case of goodwill, its cost is the amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over and above the fair value of the individual assets net of the liabilities acquired.
The value of the goodwill can arise from a number of sources, but in relation to our more recent acquisitions, it has been represented by post-acquisition synergies and the skills and knowledge of the workforce.
The value of the Groups intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, reduces over the number of years over which the Group expects to use the asset, the useful life, via an annual amortisation charge to the income statement.
The Group splits its intangible assets between those arising on acquisitions and those which do not, because the amortisation of acquired intangibles is recognised as an adjusting item in the income statement.
Where there are indications that the value of intangible assets is no longer representative of their value to the Group, for example where there is a customer relationship recognised but revenues from that customer are reducing, or where goodwill was recognised on an acquisition but the performance of the business acquired is below expectations, the directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their amortised values.
If this has happened, a one-off impairment charge is recognised.
This section explains the overall carrying values of the intangible assets within the Group and the specific judgements and estimates made by the directors in arriving at these values.
2 Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is not subject to an annual amortisation charge.
Instead, its carrying value is assessed annually by comparison to the future cash flows of the business to which it relates the cash generating unit, or CGU.
These cash flows are discounted to reflect the time value of money and this discount rate, together with the growth rates assumed in the cash flow forecasts, are the key assumptions in this impairment testing process.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs based on the synergies expected to be derived 2017 2016 from the acquisition upon which the goodwill arose.
The Group has 19 2016: % % 20 cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated.
The composition of Pre-tax discount rate 8.4 - 14.4 9.0 14.9 CGUs reflects both the way in which cash inflows are generated and the internal reporting structure.
Where our businesses operate closely with each other Long-term growth rate 0.8 - 2.1 0.9 2.1 we will continue to review whether they should be treated as a single or combined CGU.
For the purpose of assessing the significance of CGUs, the Group uses a threshold of 20% of the total goodwill balance.
Goodwill of 93.1m 2016: Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as part of the overall assessment of 85.1m associated with the Control Valves CGU in Critical Engineering is assets against their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is considered to be significant.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the value in use determined using cash flow projections from financial budgets, forecasts and valuation are the discount rate, growth rate and operating cashflows.
plans approved by the Board covering a five-year period and include a terminal These estimates are determined using the methodology discussed above.
The projected cash flows reflect the latest expectation of demand for products and services.
The discount rate applied for Control Valves is 10.1% 2016: 10.9% and a growth rate of 2.1% 2016: 2.1% is applied into perpetuity.
The key assumptions in these calculations are the long-term growth rates and the discount rates applied to forecast cash flows in addition to the achievement No other CGUs have goodwill that is considered significant in the context of the forecasts themselves.
Long-term growth rates are based on long-term of the Groups total goodwill balance, nor do any CGUs use the same key economic forecasts for growth in the manufacturing sector in the geographical assumptions for the purposes of impairment testing in either this year or regions in which the cash generating unit operates.
Pre-tax discount rates the last.
specific to each cash generating unit are calculated by adjusting the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 7% 2016: 8% for the The aggregate amount of goodwill arising from acquisitions prior to 1 January tax rate relevant to the jurisdiction before adding risk premia for the size of the 2004 which had been deducted from the profit and loss reserves and unit, the characteristics of the segment in which it resides, and the geographical incorporated into the IFRS transitional balance sheet as at 1 January 2004, regions from which the cash flows are derived.
The cumulative impairment recognised in relation to goodwill is 39m 2016: 39m.
This exercise resulted in the use of the following ranges of values for the key assumptions: 113 3.3 Property, plant and equipment The following section concerns the physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include manufacturing, distribution and office sites, as well as equipment used in the manufacture of the Groups products.
The cost of these assets represents the amount initially paid for them.
With the exception of the Groups land and assets under construction which have not yet been brought into use, a depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect the annual wear and tear and the reduction in the value of the asset over time.
For details on the periods over which assets are depreciated, see Section 5.
Depreciation is calculated by reference to the assets useful lives, by estimating the number of years over which the Group expects the asset to be used.
As we do for our intangible assets see Section 3.2, if there has been a technological change or decline in business performance the directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.
If an assets value falls below its depreciated value, a one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
The recoverable amount of these assets has been determined using their fair value less costs to sell, estimated by both internal and external valuation specialists.
Group contracts in respect of future capital expenditure which had been placed at the balance sheet date relating to the continuing business amounted to 4.9m 2016: 7.4m.
Included in the total net book value of plant and equipment is 0.4m 2016: 0.6m in respect of assets acquired under finance leases.
Depreciation for the year on these assets was 0.2m 2016: 0.2m.
114 IMI plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Section 3 operating assets and liabilities continued 3.4 Acquisitions The following section discusses businesses acquired by the Group, which have given rise to the additions to the acquired intangible assets including goodwill reported in Section 3.2 and which contributed to the Groups profits, working capital and other balance sheet asset and liabilities.
1 Acquisitions in the current year There were no acquisitions during 2017.
The Group acquired Bimba Manufacturing Company and its subsidiaries on 31 January 2018 see Section 5.3.
2 Acquisitions in the prior year There were no acquisitions during 2016.
1 Disposals in the current year On 1 September 2017, the Group disposed of Stainless Steel Fasteners SSF resulting in a loss of 2.3m which is presented in the income statement as an adjusting item.
The loss on disposal is not disclosed within discontinued operations as SSF did not represent a separate major line of business.
A summary of the proceeds received, assets disposed and resulting loss on disposal is included in the table below: SSF 1 September 2017 m Sale consideration 0.1 Net assets disposed 1.1 Costs of disposal 1.3 Loss on disposal 2.3 Net cash flow arising on disposal Cash disposed of - Cash costs of disposal 0.6 Net cash flow arising on disposal of operations 0.6 3.5.
2 Disposals in the prior year There were no disposals of subsidiaries during 2016.
115 3.6 Provisions A provision is recorded instead of a payable see Section 3.1.
3 when there is less certainty over how much cash will be paid and when the payment might be made.
When the Group has an obligation relating to previous events and when it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it, a provision rather than a payable is recorded.
In this situation, an estimate is required.
The principal estimates made in respect of the Groups provisions concern the timing and amount of payments required to: cover the costs of known restructuring projects: reimburse customers for potential product warranty claims: ensure that current and former manufacturing sites meet relevant environmental standards: reflect the estimated outcome of ongoing legal disputes: and provide against indemnities following the disposal of subsidiaries.
Analysis of the Groups provisions: Environmental, Trade legal & Restructuring warranties indemnity Total m m m m Current 11.1 8.0 0.8 19.9 Non-current 1.0 9.4 8.7 19.1 At 1 January 2017 12.1 17.4 9.5 39.0 Arising during the year 26.7 0.1 0.4 27.0 Utilised during the year 24.8 4.4 2.7 31.9 Exchange adjustment 0.5 0.1 0.1 0.5 At 31 December 2017 14.5 12.8 7.3 34.6 Current 13.0 6.2 - 19.2 Non-current 1.5 6.6 7.3 15.4 14.5 12.8 7.3 34.6 The restructuring provision reflects residual amounts committed but not spent in relation to a number of specific projects and the majority is expected to be utilised within the next 12 months.
Trade warranties are given in the normal course of business and cover a range of periods, typically one to two years, with the expected amounts falling due in less than and greater than one year separately analysed above.
Amounts set aside represent the directors best estimate regarding the amount of the settlements and the timing of resolution with customers.
Environmental and legal provisions recognise the Groups obligation to remediate contaminated land at a number of current and former sites, together with current legal cases for which a settlement is considered probable.
Because of the long-term nature of the liabilities, the timescales are uncertain and the provisions represent the directors best estimates of these costs.
Provisions for indemnities included in the agreed terms of disposals of subsidiaries are provided for based on the expected probability of indemnified losses that may be suffered by the purchaser.
116 IMI plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Section 4 capital structure and financing costs What you will find in this section This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing costs.
The directors determine the appropriate capital structure for the Group, specifically, how much cash is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
The directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business plan.
The Board is mindful that equity capital cannot be easily flexed and in particular raising new equity would normally be likely only in the context of an acquisition.
Debt can be issued and repurchased more easily but frequent changes lead to high transaction costs and debt holders are under no obligation to accept repurchase offers.
4.1 Net debt Net debt is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total outstanding debt, net of the current cash resources.
Some of the Groups borrowings and cash are held in foreign currencies.
Movements in foreign exchange rates affect the sterling value of the net debt.

2.1 339.9 337.0 Managing credit risk arising from customers The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, have less of an influence on credit risk.
Our largest single customer accounted for 2% of our 2017 revenues 2016: 2%.
Geographically there is no unusual concentration of credit risk.
The Groups contract approval procedure ensures that large contracts are signed off at executive director level at which time the risk profile of the contract, including potential credit and foreign exchange risks, is reviewed.
Credit risk is minimised through due diligence on potential customers, appropriate credit limits, cash flow management and the use of documentary credits where appropriate.

3 Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the Groups income and cash flows or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Under the management of the central treasury function, the Group enters into derivatives in the ordinary course of business and also manages financial liabilities in order to mitigate market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board and are undertaken only if they relate to underlying exposures.
Exchange contracts and non-sterling debt are financial instruments used as currency hedges of overseas net assets.
3.2 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to a number of global interest rates through assets and liabilities denominated in jurisdictions to which these rates are applied, most notably US, Eurozone and UK rates.
The Group is exposed to these because market movements in these rates will increase or decrease the interest charge recognised in the Group income statement.
a Management of interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of maintaining a portion of its liabilities at fixed interest rates and reviewing the balance of the floating rate exposure to ensure that if interest rates rise globally the effect on the Groups income statement is manageable.
Interest rates are managed using fixed and floating rate debt and financial instruments including interest rate swaps.
Floating rate liabilities comprise short-term debt which bears interest at short-term bank rates and the liability side of exchange contracts where the interest element is based primarily on three month inter-bank rates.
All cash surpluses are invested for short periods and are treated as floating rate investments.
Non-interest bearing financial assets and liabilities including short-term trade receivables and payables have been excluded from the following analysis.

The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations.
The Group generally calculates its own fair values using comparable observed market prices and a valuation model using the respective and relevant market data for the instrument being valued.
1 Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out the Groups accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities, and their fair values at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes and transacts all derivatives with suitable investment grade counterparties.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from the Groups business activities.

Valuation techniques for level 2 inputs Derivative assets and liabilities of 4.1m and 3.9m respectively are valued by level 2 techniques.
The valuations are derived from discounted contractual cash flows using observable, and directly relevant, market interest rates and foreign exchange rates from market data providers.
Valuation techniques for level 3 inputs The Group has no financial assets or financial liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable level 3 inputs.
2 Valuation methodology Cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, trade payables and trade receivables are carried at their book values as this approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments.
Long-term and short-term borrowings, apart from any which are subject to hedging arrangements, are carried at amortised cost as it is the intention that they will not be repaid prior to maturity, where this option exists.
The fair values are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates and relevant credit spreads.
Long-term borrowings which are subject to hedging arrangements are valued using appropriate discount rates to value the relevant hedged cash flows.
Derivative assets and liabilities, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and metal hedges, are valued using comparable observed market prices and a valuation model using foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves for the underlying commodities.
3 Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
4.8 Market risk sensitivity analysis on financial instruments This section shows how the fair value of financial instruments presented can change for a given change in market rates.
The values shown in the table below are estimates of the impact on financial instruments only.
The risks that these financial instruments have been acquired to hedge will move in an opposite direction.
1 Overview In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax and equity.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.

There is a significant degree of estimation involved in predicting the ultimate benefits payable under these defined benefit arrangements in respect of which the Group holds net liabilities on its balance sheet.
This section explains how the value of these benefits payable and any assets funding the arrangements are accounted for in the Group financial statements and gives details of the key assumptions upon which the estimations are based.
Assets and liabilities for defined contribution arrangements are minimal as they relate solely to short-term timing differences between the period during which benefits have accrued and when contributions are paid into schemes.
Defined contribution DC : Arrangements where the employer pays fixed contributions into an external fund on behalf of the employee who is responsible for making the investment decision and therefore assumes the risks and rewards of fund performance.
Contributions to these arrangements are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit DB : A defined benefit pension plan is a pension arrangement in which the employer promises a specified annual benefit on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employees earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.
In some cases, this benefit is paid as a lump sum on leaving the Company or while in the service of the Company rather than as a pension.
The Group underwrites one or more risks in meeting these obligations and therefore any net liability or surplus in these arrangements is shown on the Group balance sheet.
1 Summary information Net pension deficit: 77.9m 2016: deficit of 79.8m The net pension deficit or net liability for defined benefit obligations DBO at 31 December 2017 was 77.9m 2016: deficit of 79.8m.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes are aggregated, recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and shown within non-current liabilities or in non-current assets if a scheme is in surplus and it is recoverable.
Number of defined benefit arrangements: 69 2016: 63 The number of defined benefit arrangements increased following the recognition of six schemes in Mexico and a scheme in the United Arab Emirates UAE, offset by the wind-up of a pension scheme in the US.

The estimated cost of awarding these share options is charged to the income statement over the period that the Group benefits from the employees services.
This cost is then added back to retained earnings, to reflect that there is no overall impact on the Groups balance sheet until the shares are issued to the employees when the options are exercised.
The individual share option schemes, the number of options outstanding under each of them, the estimated cost of these options recognised in the income statement and the assumptions used in arriving at this estimated cost are described in this section.

On 23 November 2017 the Group acquired the remaining 30% shareholding in Shanghai CCI Power Control Equipment Co Limited for 1.1m.
The non-controlling interest denoted SLP related to an interest in the IMI Scottish Limited Partnership, which is held jointly by two pension funds, IMI 2014 Deferred Fund and IMI 2014 Pensioner Fund together the Funds.
The interest in the SLP provides the Funds with a conditional entitlement to receive income of 4.4m per annum, unless the Group has not paid a dividend in the prior year or the Funds were fully funded.
The terms of this conditional entitlement were altered on 31 January 2017 as part of the formal buy-out transaction, resulting in the SLP and its associated non-controlling interest being derecognised from the Groups balance sheet from that date.

The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a net asset to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan and restricted by any relevant asset ceiling.
Any deduction made by the tax authorities in the event of a refund of a surplus would be regarded by the Group as an income tax.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Re-measurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity and disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.
Long-term service and other post-employment benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service and other postemployment benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Groups obligations.
Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Group operates a number of equity and equityrelated compensation benefits as set out in Section 4.11.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense each year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement.
For newly issued shares, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
