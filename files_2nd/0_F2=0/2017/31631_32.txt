Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have had significant impact upon the financial information, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Thisapproach forms the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information.
Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are described below.
Impairment of fixed asset investments Determining whether fixed asset investments are impaired requires judgement and estimation.
The Directors periodically review fixed asset investments for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgement, that the carrying amount ofanasset may not be recoverable.
Such indicating events would include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions ortechnology and expectations of future operating losses or negative cash flows.
