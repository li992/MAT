The denominators for the calculations i. e. the weighted average number of shares in issue and further details of the calculations are shown in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Like-for-like amounts Like-for-like amounts are derived, on a constant currency basis, by comparing the relevant year-to-date amount with the equivalent prior year period for those businesses and individual operating units that have been part of the Group throughout both periods.
Where the number of days differs between the current and prior year periods, the prior year amount is normalised for this when calculating like-for-like amounts.
