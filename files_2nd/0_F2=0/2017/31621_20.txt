British Empire Trust plc 73 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Investment Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GLOSSARY Alternative Performance Measure APM An APM is a numerical measure of the Companys current, historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial framework.
Discount Premium If the share price is lower than the NAV per share it is said to be trading at a discount.
The size of the Companys discount is calculated by subtracting the share price of 693.50p from the NAV per share of 777.62p and is usually expressed as a percentage of the NAV per share.
If the share price is higher than the NAV per share, this situation is called a premium.
Gearing Gearing refers to the level of the Companys debt to its equity capital.
The Company may borrow money to invest in additional investments for its portfolio.
If the Companys assets grow, the shareholders assets grow proportionately more because the debt remains the same.
But if the value of the Companys assets falls, the situation is reversed.
Gearing can therefore enhance performance in rising markets but can adversely impact performance in falling markets.
The gearing of 7.88% represents borrowings of 71,176,000 expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds of 903,229,000.

Shareholders funds are the total value of all the Companys assets, at a current market value, having deducted all liabilities and prior charges at their par value or at their asset value.

Shares Bought Back and Held in Treasury The Company may repurchase its own shares and these are then held in treasury, reducing the freely traded shares ranking for dividends and enhancing returns and earnings per Ordinary Share to the remaining shareholders.
The Company repurchases the shares at a value below the NAV at a discount.
The estimated percentage added to NAV per share from buybacks of 0.8% is derived from the repurchase of shares in the market at a discount to the prevailing NAV at the point of repurchase.
The shares were bought back at a weighted average discount of 11.4%.
Total Assets Total assets represents total assets less current liabilities before deduction of all borrowings.
Total Return NAV and Share Price Returns The combined effect of any dividends paid, together with the rise or fall in the share price or NAV.

Any dividends received by a shareholder are assumed to have been reinvested in either additional shares of the Company at the time the shares go ex-dividend the share price total return or in the assets of the Company at its NAV per share the NAV total return.
