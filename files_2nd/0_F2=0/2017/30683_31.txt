This has led to changes in the data from previous years.
The data quoted in this Annual Report are generated from the revised data.
2 Included in this section are greenhouse gases from direct fuel combustion, process and engineering emissions at our sites and from fuel use in our vehicle fleet.
3 Greenhouse gases from imported electricity are calculated using the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance January 2015 requiring the dual reporting using two emissions factors for each site market-based and location-based.
Location-based factors are the grid average emissions factor for the country or subregion in the US that a site is in.
Market-based factors are more specific to the site and local energy market, taking account of the residual energy mix a site is sourcing power from and any certified renewable power purchased by a site.
