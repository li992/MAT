16 Risk management policies and procedures 16.1 Market risk Janus Henderson assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level ofmarket risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the fairvalue of quoted and unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manages the risks inherent in the investment policy by ensuring full and timely reporting of relevant information from Janus Henderson.
Investment performance is reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Board monitors Janus Hendersons compliance with the Companys objectives and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation, including as between countries and economies.
The Companys exposure to changes in market prices on its investments was as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Equities 1,101,803 951,197 Fixed interest 13 22 1,101,816 951,219 Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the Companys net assets to an increase ordecrease of 20% 2016: 20% in the fair values of the Companys investments at each statement of financial position date.
Thislevel of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk Janus Henderson monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
Janus Henderson measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rates to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings may be used to limit the Companys exposure to future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings are limited to 20% of the adjusted net asset value.
Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company did not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements anditsreceipt.
During the year, derivative contracts were not used to hedge against exposure to currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 October are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Hong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ Other 2017 000 000 000 000 000 Other receivables 156 214 734 567 Cash and cash equivalents 851 Current liabilities 8,094 Total foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 156 214 7,360 1,418 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 349,640 129,425 123,892 34,026 170,354 Total net foreign currency exposures 349,796 129,639 116,532 34,026 171,772 Hong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ Other 2016 000 000 000 000 000 Other receivables 1,009 220 688 4,695 Cash and cash equivalents 1,607 Current liabilities 4,150 520 6,025 Total foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 3,141 220 688 520 277 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 310,451 97,101 105,048 32,641 130,348 Total net foreign currency exposures 307,310 97,321 105,736 32,121 130,625 61 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2017 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.1.
2 Currency risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the total profit after tax for the year and the net assets in regard to movements in the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates for the US dollar sterling, euro sterling, Japanese yen sterling and Hong Kong dollar sterling.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar sterling - 10% 2016: 10%, euro sterling - 10% 2016: 10%, Japanese yen sterling - 10% 2016: 10%, Hong Kong dollar sterling - 10% 2016: 10%.
10% has been used for illustrative purposes and does not reflect the actual movement in currency rates during the year.
These percentages are deemed reasonable based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities held at each statement of financial position date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of a depreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2017 2016 Hong Hong US Japanese Kong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 781 431 237 125 659 246 213 96 Capital return 38,849 14,380 13,766 3,781 33,748 10,762 11,643 3,618 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 39,630 14,811 14,003 3,906 34,407 11,008 11,856 3,714 The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of a appreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2017 2016 Hong Hong US Japanese Kong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 639 352 194 103 538 201 174 79 Capital return 31,785 11,766 11,263 3,093 28,293 8,805 9,526 2,960 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 32,424 12,118 11,457 3,196 28,831 9,006 9,700 3,039 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable from cash at bank, the current asset investment and the value of fixed interest investments.
Management of the risk The Companys exposure to interest rate risk is managed by Janus Henderson and is reported to the Board on a regular basis.
62 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2017 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.1.
3 Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 October of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.
Floating interest rates exposure is by reference to when the interest rate is due to be re-set.
2017 2016 Within one More than Within one More than year one year Total year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 24,102 24,102 23,271 23,271 Current asset investment 23,252 23,252 21,354 21,354 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Fixed interest investments 13 13 22 22 Debentures 15,000 15,000 15,000 15,000 Unsecured loan notes 49,816 49,816 49,806 49,806 47,354 64,803 17,449 44,625 64,784 20,159 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made and borrowings are drawn down and repaid.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2016: same.
Interest paid on debentures and unsecured loan notes is set out in note 7.
Interest rate sensitivity The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its cash balances, its current asset investments and fixed income investments.
The sensitivity of each exposure is as follows: Cash Cash balances vary throughout the year.
Cash balances at the year end were 24,102,000 2016: 23,271,000 and, if that level of cash was maintained for a full year, a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 241,000 2016: 233,000.
Current asset investment sensitivity The Companys interest bearing current asset investment at the year end was 23,252,000 2016: 21,354,000 and, if that level of investment was maintained for a full year, a 100 basis points change in interest rates up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 233,000 2016: 214,000.
Fixed income investment sensitivity The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 13,000 2016: 22,000 and is not currently paying interest and therefore there is no modified duration interest rate sensitivity 2016: no duration.
16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has an overdraft facility with the Custodian, the extent of which is determined by the Custodian on a regularbasis by reference to the value of the securities held by it on behalf of the Company.
The facility is subject to regular review.
The Company also has a debenture and unsecured loan notes, details of which can be found in note 15 on page 60.
The Board gives guidance to Janus Henderson as to the maximum amounts of the Companys resources that should be invested inany one company.
The policy is that the Company should generally remain fully invested and that short-term borrowings be used to manage shorttermcash requirements.
63 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2017 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.2 Liquidity risk continued Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 October, based on the earliest date on which payment could be required was as follows: 2017 2016 Due between Due between Due within three months Due after Due within three months Due after three months and one year one year three months and one year one year 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 1,200 21,000 1,200 22,200 Unsecured loan notes 920 920 81,280 920 920 83,120 Other payables 9,451 12,117 10,371 2,120 102,280 13,037 2,120 105,320 16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk Credit risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of approved brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by Janus Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: and cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and is subject to continual review.
Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by Janus Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
Stock lending is the temporary transfer of securities by a lender to a borrower, with an agreement by the borrower to return equivalent securities to the lender at an agreed future date.
Stock lending revenue is received for making the investments available to the borrower which increases the returns on the portfolio.
In all cases securities lent continue to be recognised on the statement of financial position.
Details of the securities on loan at the year end, and the collateral held can be found in note 4 on page 56 and on pages 71 and 72.
Other than stock lending transactions and debenture stock, none of the Companys financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Company through its decision to transact withcounterparties of high credit quality.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which are approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default through settlement.
The credit ratings of brokers are reviewed periodically byJanus Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
The Company is exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the Companys rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The Companys cash balances are held by its custodian, BNP Paribas Securities Services.
The Directors believe the counterparty is of high credit quality and, therefore, the Company has minimal exposure to credit risk.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.

The par value of the debenture stock and unsecured loan notes can be found in note 15.
The fair values are calculated using prices quoted on the exchange on which the instruments trade and are categorised as Level 1 as described below.
In order to comply with fair value accounting disclosures only, the fair valueof the loan notes has been estimated to be 55,155,000 2016: 54,483,000 and is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as described below.
However, for the purpose of the daily NAV announcements, the unsecured loan notes are valued atamortised cost in the fair value NAV because it is not traded and the Directors expect it to be held to maturity and, accordingly, theDirectors have assessed that this is the most appropriate value to be applied for this purpose.
16.5 Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out the fair value measurements using IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

The unquoted equity investment is valued with reference to a promissory note value at the date of issue in November 2016, a payment-in-kind interest rate that accrues to the redemption date and a discount rate to reflect credit risk and illiquidity.
