FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 GENERAL INFORMATION Thomas Cook Group plc is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is 3rd Floor, South Building, 200 Aldersgate, London EC1A 4HD.
The principal activities of the Group are discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 59.
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 21 November 2017.
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC and Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
After making enquiries and taking into account the matters set out in the Risk Management section on pages 54 to 59, the Directors confirm that they consider it appropriate to use the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report & Accounts.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value through the profit or loss, share-based payments and defined benefit pension obligations.
The financial statements have been rounded to the nearest million in Great British Pounds.
Amounts in pence have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a pence.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial information presented in this document are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Management identified several adjustments that, in their opinion should be applied to Thomas Cooks financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2016.
As a result these have been restated.
Refer to Note 33 for further details of the restatement.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3A CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY AND DISCLOSURE No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 October 2016 have had a material impact on the Group or parent company.
New or amended standard and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or EU endorsed At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective or EU endorsed: IFRS 9 Financial instruments is a replacement for IAS 39 Financial Instruments and covers three distinct areas.
Phase 1 contains new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
Phase 2 relates to the impairment of financial assets and requires the calculation of impairment on an expected loss basis rather than the current incurred loss basis.
Phase 3 relates to less stringent requirements for general hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 is effective for periods commencing onor after 1 January 2018, and therefore will be applied by the Group in fiscal year 2019.
Based on our preliminary assessment, theGroup does not currently anticipate a material impact from the new standard other than in providing additional disclosures in the Annual Report.
IFRS 15 Revenues from Contracts with Customers introduces a five-step approach to the timing of revenue recognition based on performance obligations in customer contracts.
IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing 1 January 2018 and therefore will be applied by the Group in fiscal year 2019.
The Group continues to assess the possible impact of IFRS 15, which involves: an examination of key contract types in order to identify any distinct performance obligations in the context of the contractual arrangement: assessing the point at which the Group delivers promised services to its customers and whether this presents a requirement tochange the timing of its revenue recognition: and understanding the specific new disclosure requirements prescribed.
Based on our preliminary assessment, the Group does not currently anticipate a material impact from the new standard other than in providing additional disclosures in the Annual Report.
122 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3A CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY AND DISCLOSURE CONTINUED IFRS 16 Leases provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all applicable leases.
The leasing standard is expected to have a material impact on net debt, gross assets, profit from operations and interest.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, and therefore will be applied by the Group in fiscal year 2020.
Management have commenced a project across the Group to assess the overall impact of the standard, including considering the systems and processes required for implementation and the options around transition.
We expect to report on the impact in the 2018 Annual Report.
In addition, the Group awaits the result of ongoing HMRC consultation to understand the impact on taxes.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard.
The Group plans to assess the impact of IFRS 17 closer to implementation date.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption permitted.
IFRIC 23 clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurements requirements in IAS12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
The Group is assessing the impact of IFRIC 23.
There are no further IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Joint venture and associates Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts significant influence, but not control or joint control, are associates.
Entities which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures.
The Groups investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost.
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date.
Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
Foreign currency The presentation currency of the Group is Sterling.
Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than Sterling.
The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are recorded through a separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the year end are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is recorded in the Costs of providing tourism services within the Income Statement.
When a foreign entity is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Groups income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 123 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Intangible assets other Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Groups balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other than capitalised development costs, including those that are internally generated, expenditure is reflected in the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the intangible assets useful life, when finite, as follows: Brands 9 years to indefinite life Customer relationships 1 to 15 years Computer software 3 to 10 years Indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually at the CGU level by comparing their carrying amount to their recoverable amount.
All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment.
If such indications exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight-line depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Where costs are incurred as part of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for use but incapable of operating in the manner intended by Management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are included within the cost of the item.
Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straightline basis and aims to write-down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years Leasehold properties Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years Aircraft 23 years or remaining lease period if shorter Aircraft spares 5 to 15 years or remaining lease period if shorter Other fixed assets 3 to 15 years Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs Major overhaul expenditure, including replacement spares and labour costs, is capitalised and amortised over the average expected life between major overhauls.
All other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of fleet assets including maintenance provided under pay-as-you-go contracts are charged to the income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.
Provision is made for the future costs of major overhauls of operating leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making appropriate charges to the income statement, calculated by reference to hours flown and or the expired lease period, as a consequence of obligations placed upon the Group under the terms of certain operating leases.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
124 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and fuel price risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value, on derivatives not designated as a hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derivatives are presented on the balance sheet on a gross basis.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Hedge accounting For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement as part of finance income or cost line, where they offset the changes in fair value on the hedged item.
Where the hedged item is designated in a fair value hedge relationship of a financial liability held at amortised cost, the change in fair value in respect to the hedged risk is recorded as a fair value adjustment within finance income or cost.
Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time the changes in fair value on the hedging instrument will continue to be recognised immediately into the income statement, while the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for fair value changes.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value on derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of future cash flows is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within net operating expenses.
Forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options are not designated as part of the hedging relationship and therefore are recorded in the income statement within costs of providing tourism.
Changes in fair value deferred through the hedge reserve are recognised in the income statement in the same period, or periods, in which the hedged highly probable forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards relating to the financial asset or when the contractual rights to the cash flows associated with the financial asset expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The measurement of particular financial assets and liabilities is set out below.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, term deposits and investment in money market funds which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.
Where the Group operates centrally pooled accounts and has the legal right along with the intention and ability to pool account balances, the net cash or overdraft position is disclosed.
Where the intention or ability to pool balances together is absent, the cash and overdraft are disclosed on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet and the overdraft is excluded from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised directly in equity until the financial asset is derecognised.
At this point, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Any impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses or dividends receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held for trading investments Short-term investments and derivatives that are not designated in a hedge relationship such as natural hedges of a balance sheet exposure are classified as held for trading and are recognised and subsequently measured at their fair value.
Gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Other non-current asset investments The fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured using an appropriate valuation technique.
Where a fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are initially recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings that are designated as hedged items in a fair value hedge relationship are adjusted for changes in their fair value in respect of the hedged risk.
The adjustment will be amortised to the income statement at the time when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk.
Provisions The Group recognises a provision when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are recognised at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value.
Pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes.
The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Groups obligations under the schemes calculated using the projected unit credit method and the fair value of those schemes assets.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The current service cost, representing benefits accruing over the year, is included in the income statement as a personnel expense.
The unwinding of the discount rate on the scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are presented as finance costs and finance income respectively.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in personnel expenses.
Pension costs charged against profits in respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes represent the amount of the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Share capital Ordinary Shares including share premium are classified as equity.
126 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Leases Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases.
All other leases are operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected useful lives.
The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration.
The fair values of the share options are calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model.
These fair values are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This credit is not considered to be distributable under the Companies Act 2006.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Revenue recognition The Groups revenue is measured as the aggregate amount of gross revenue receivable from inclusive tours, airline travel services, hotel services, travel agency commission and other travel services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.
The Group records revenue on a net basis after deducting trade discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and compensation vouchers granted to customers.
Revenue relating to travel services arranged by the Groups leisure and airline travel providers, are taken to the income statement on the date of holiday and flight departure.
Revenue relating to other services provided by the Group is taken to the income statement as earned.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the significant risks and rewards of ownership is transferred to the customer, usually on delivery of the goods.
Monies received by the balance sheet date relating to holidays commencing and flights departing after the period end are included within current liabilities as revenue received in advance.
Expenses Direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Groups leisure travel providers are taken to the income statement on holiday departure or over the period to which they relate as appropriate.
Indirect expenses are recognised in the income statement over the period to which goods and services are received by the Group.
Separately disclosed items The Group separately discloses to profit before tax in the income statement: non-recurring items, impairment of goodwill and amortisation of business combination intangibles: and IAS 39 fair value remeasurement.
Separately disclosed items, namely items that are material either because of their size or their nature, or which are non-recurring, are presented within their relevant income statement category, but highlighted through separate disclosure.
The separate reporting helps provide a full understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
Items which are included within the separately disclosed category include: profits losses on disposal of assets or businesses and costs of acquisitions: costs of integration of significant acquisitions and other major restructuring programmes which may extend over a number of years: significant goodwill or other asset impairments: material write-down of assets reassessment of accruals, reflecting a more cautious evaluation in light of current trading and economic conditions: and other individually material items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG currently known as Thomas Cook GmbH and MyTravel Group plc and other business combinations made in subsequent years.
The amortisation of these intangible assets is significant and the Groups Management considers that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding ofthe Groups results.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 127 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED IAS 39 fair value remeasurement includes movements in forward points related to foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options in cash flow hedging relationships.
Both items are subject to market fluctuations and unwind when the options or forward contracts mature and therefore are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
Interest income and charges arising on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and interest charges arising on the unwind of discount on exceptional provisions and contingent consideration are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
In addition, certain finance costs or income that derive from one-off events or transactions are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
The Groups Management considers that these items should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding ofthe Groups results.
Finance income and costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, expected return on pension plan assets, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives, and fair value adjustments to hedged items in a designated fair value hedge.
Finance costs comprise interest costs on borrowings and finance leases, unwind of the discount on non-current liabilities, interest cost on pension plan liabilities, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives and changes in fair value of derivatives designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
The changes in fair value on derivatives designated in a fair value hedge relationship and the fair value adjustment on hedged items in a fair value hedge relationship are separately disclosed in Note 7 under the description Finance related charges.
Tax Current tax Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable recoverable in respect of the taxable profit tax loss for a period.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base, with the following exceptions: Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting or taxable profit or loss: In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, tax losses or credits carried forward can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Allocation of tax charge or credit between income statement, other comprehensive income and equity Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognised directly within other comprehensive income, in which case the associated tax is recognised directly in other comprehensive income respectively.
Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data for its Ordinary Shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
EPS measures for continuing operations have been presented in accordance with IAS 33.
The Group also presents a basic and diluted underlying EPS measure based on underlying profit before tax as defined in the Separately Disclosed Items section above.
Further details of the EPS calculation are presented in Note 11.
128 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3C CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS In applying its accounting policies, the Group has made estimates and assumptions concerning the future, which may differ from the related actual outcomes.
Those estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Revenue recognition A key judgement in recognising revenue is to distinguish where the Groups businesses act in the capacity of principal or agent so to determine the accounting as either gross or net respectively, in line with IAS 18 Revenue Recognition.
The Group exercises judgement to assess principal or agency by considering if it is the prime obligor in all the revenue arrangements, has pricing discretion and is exposed toinventory and credit risk, in which case the Group will be principal to the arrangement.
Impairment of goodwill Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash flows to be generated by certain of the Groups businesses in order to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life in relation to those businesses.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft fleet.
Provisions for illness claims and associated recoveries In calculating the level of provisions required, judgements have been made on the probability of success in defending legal claims and estimated outcome of such claims.
In assessing associated recoveries, judgements have been made been on the estimate of the amounts that will be recovered from hotel suppliers.
Tax Judgements have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses, and deferred tax assets have been recognised as aresult.
The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates offuture profitability.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 129 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 4 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION During the year, the Group refined its organisational structure resulting in a reassessment of its reportable segments.

These programmes commenced in 2015 and were planned over a 3 year period, with a focus on generating efficiencies within the Group by co-operating more closely across all source markets: rather than duplicating activity in each individual market.
The costs that we have separately disclosed in relation to these programmes include the cost of external professional advice and redundancies, as well as the cost of dedicated personnel both external consultants and internal employees assigned to New Operating Model projects.
The work of these teams focuses on aligning and driving harmonised activities across the Group in each business area, including finance, digital, marketing, product and yield management.
This work represents an investment in our transformation, resulting in a temporary increase in costs by doubling up resource in some business areas, as we transform our business model into one that is horizontally aligned across the Group under a matrix structure.
Once processes are fully co-ordinated and harmonised in these areas, these additional costs will fall away.
Accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to separately disclose these costs.
The New Operating Model was initially established as a three year transformation project and these costs are expected to continue to be incurred until implementation is complete.
Restructuring costs of 12m 2016: 20m largely relate to legacy rationalisation in Continental Europe, namely France and Russia.
Reassessment of contingent consideration In December 2016, the Group announced its intention to acquire full control of its UK retail store network, following notification by The Co-operative Group the Co-op of the decision to exercise its option over its stake in their UK retail joint venture.
In line with the requirements of IFRS, the Group has reassessed the carrying value of a contingent obligation to acquire the Co-op shares and this reassessment resulted in a reduction of 32m to the liability previously accrued.
As part of the reassessment it was noted that a payment of 4m was made in the prior period which has been restated in the comparatives above refer to Note 33.
Onerous leases and store closures Onerous leases and store closures of 30m 2016: 21m relates to a provision associated with loss-making UK stores.
The provision follows the results of a strategic review of the UK store network as part of the New Operating Model.
Asset revaluation reviews Asset valuation reviews of 15m primarily relate to write-offs of property, fixtures and fittings of closed UK stores and IT assets in the UK no longer required as part of the implementation of the New Operating Model.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 135 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 7 SEPARATELY DISCLOSED ITEMS CONTINUED Amortisation of business combination intangibles Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Groupplc and other business combinations made in subsequent years.
The amortisation of these intangible assets is significant and the Groups Management considers that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
Other Other separately disclosed items of 24m includes 15m in relation to investment in the set-up of partnerships and new business developments, 6m of costs incurred relating to repatriation of guests net of insurance received for Hurricane Irma and 6m of costs incurred for fraudulent illness claims.
In addition there is a 6m gain from the movement in forward points related to foreign exchange forward contracts and the time value of options in cash flow hedge relationships.
Finance related charges The Group has provisions for future liabilities arising from separately disclosed circumstances, primarily deferred acquisition consideration.
A notional interest charge of 11m on the discounted value of such provisions is recognised within separately disclosed finance related charges.
In addition, the Group incurred an interest charge of 23m as a result of issuing a new Euro bond in December 2016 which refinanced the Groups debt at a lower interest rate, while net interest charges arising on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes were7m.

The carrying value of brand names and goodwill is analysed by cash generating unit as follows: Goodwill Goodwill Brand names Brand names 2016 2017 2016 2017 m m m m UK Tour Operator 1,038 1,030 67 67 Northern Europe Tour Operator 505 494 53 51 Continental Europe Tour Operator 183 181 130 126 Group Airline 901 890 2,627 2,595 250 244 Impairment Testing In accordance with IFRS, the Group tests the carrying value of goodwill and brand names with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances change.
Impairment testing is performed by comparing the carrying value of each cash-generating unit CGU to the recoverable amount, determined on the basis of the CGUs value in use.
The value in use is based on the net present value of future cash flow projections discounted at pretax rates appropriate for each CGU.
During the year, the Group refined its organisational structure resulting in a reassessment of its reportable segments.
This has resulted in a reassessment of its CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing, which now consist of UK Tour Operator, Northern Europe Tour Operator, Continental Europe Tour Operator and Group Airline.
The future cash flow projections used to determine the value in use are based on the most recent annual budgets and four-year plans for each of the CGUs.
The key assumptions used to determine the business budget and four-year plans relate to capacity and the pricing of accommodation and fuel inputs.
Capacity is based on Managements view of market demand and the constraints to managing capacity such as aircraft lease commitments.
The accommodation pricing is primarily driven by the underlying bed rate and the foreign exchange hedges in place.
The former is based on the businesses ongoing dialogue with bed suppliers and local cost inflation.
The fuel pricing assumption is primarily driven by the fuel hedges in place and the forward fuel curve at the time that the budget is set.
The key assumptions used to determine the Independent business budget and four-year plans relate to passenger volumes and commission rates, and are based on the individual businesses view of the market conditions.
Cash flow forecasts for years beyond the four-year plan are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate of 2%.
A a pre-tax discount rate of between 9.8% 10.2% reflecting the specific risks of each CGU is used to calculate the value in use for each of the CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed as Management believes that any reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the carrying value of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

No interest is charged on the receivables.
The credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are provided.
In the case of travel services sold by third party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those supplies.
The Groups current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally be made for periods of up to two years in advance.
There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods.
Deposits and prepayments also include 7m 2016: 5m of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Allowances for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed in the business units where the debts arise and are based on local Management experience.
Factors that are considered include the age of the debt, previous experience with the counterparty and local trading conditions.
Trade receivables arise from individual customers as well as businesses in the travel sector.
The Directors do not consider there to be significant concentration of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables.

1,183m 2016: 1,025m of the fair value which relates to issued bonds has been calculated using quoted market prices.
For all other borrowings, the Directors consider that the fair value of 291m 2016: 742m is approximate to the carrying amount.
In 2017, the Group has 32m as security to aircraft 2016: 63m and 37m as a security to property 2016: 29m.
Borrowing facilities As at 30 September 2017, the Group had undrawn committed debt facilities of 472m 2016: 481m and undrawn committed debt facilities plus cash available to repay revolving credit facility of 1,824m 2016: 2,212m.
Whilst these facilities have certain financial covenants they are not expected to prevent full utilisation of the facilities if required.
The Group has complied with its covenants throughout the year.
In December 2016 we issued a new 750 million bond.
The new bond, bearing a coupon of 6.25% and maturing in June 2022, enabled us to redeem in full both the outstanding 200 million principal of our 300 million bond due in June 2017, and our entire 525 million bond due in June 2020.
146 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19 BORROWINGS CONTINUED In November 2017 the Group entered into new financing arrangements being an enlarged 875 million revolving credit facility and bonding and guarantee facility, maturing in November 2022.
In addition the Group has secured 100 million of annual rolling bilateral funding from one of their insurance providers.
These new arrangements replace the Groups existing facility, which provided 800 million of facilities until May 2019.
Covenant measures The covenant measures are tested quarterly on a rolling 12-month basis and consist of a leverage covenant and a fixed charge covenant.
The leverage covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft operating lease rentals compared to net debt.
The fixed charge covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and operating lease charges compared to net interest and operating lease charges.
The leverage and fixed charge covenant hurdles vary depending on the period that they relate to, reflecting the seasonality of the Groups business.

The Directors consider that the fair value of the Groups finance lease obligations with a carrying value of 154m was 176m at 30 September 2017 2016: carrying value 183m: fair value 191m.
The fair values quoted were determined on the basis of the interest rates for the corresponding terms to repayment as at the year end.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets.

The different methods are defined as follows: Level 1: valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2: derived using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
The fair value of financial instruments is determined by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Level 3: valued using techniques incorporating information other than observable market data as at least one input to the valuation cannot be based on observable market data.
The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are set out below: 2017 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Financial assets Currency contracts 30 30 131 131 Fuel contracts 32 32 24 24 Interest rate swaps 16 16 Financial liabilities Currency contracts 115 115 35 35 Fuel contracts 2 2 51 51 Contingent consideration 1 1 79 79 At 30 September 56 56 85 79 6 The fair values of financial instruments have been calculated using discounted cash flow analysis.
In December 2016, the Group announced its intention to acquire full control of its UK retail store network, following notification by The Co-operative Group of the decision to exercise its option over its stake in their UK retail joint venture.
The Groups contingent consideration is now fixed, therefore is no longer classified as a Level 3 financial liability.
There were no other Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as at 30 September 2017.
Currency hedges are entered into up to a maximum of 24 months in advance of the forecasted requirement.
As at 30 September 2017, the Group had in place currency hedging derivative financial instruments with a maximum maturity of May 2019 2016: February 2018.
The Group also uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in the price of fuel.
The Group enters into fixed price contracts swaps and net purchased options in the management of its fuel price.
All fuel hedges are designated as cash flow hedges.
Fuel price hedges are entered into up to a maximum of 24 months in advance of forecasted consumption of fuel.
Trades with maturities longer than 24 months need additional approval in line with treasury policy.
As at 30 September 2017, the Group had in place fuel price hedging derivative financial instruments with a maximum maturity of March 2019 2016: March 2018.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 149 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED In addition, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate exposures.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate movements in connection with the financing of aircraft and other assets and to hedge against interest rate exposures on fixed rate debt.
The Group also enters into cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and the currency exposure on foreign currency external borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency contracts in designated fair value hedge relationships at 30 September 2017 was a liability of 1m 2016: 16m asset.
As at 30 September 2017, the maximum maturity of interest rate derivatives was June 2022 2016: June 2020.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments have been calculated using underlying market prices available on 30 September 2017.
During the year, a gain of 60m 2016: 105m loss was transferred from the hedge reserve to the income statement following recognition of the hedged transactions.
The amount included in each line item in the income statement is shown below.
In addition, a gain of 6m was recognised in the income statement in respect of the forward points on foreign exchange cash flow hedging contracts 2016: 2m gain and a gain of nil in respect of the movement in the time value of options in cash flow hedging relationships 2016: 3m gain.

The closing hedging reserve, excluding the impact of tax, was a loss of 44m 2016: 36m gain.
The periods in which the cash flows are expected to occur and when they are expected to impact the income statement are a loss of 35m 2016: 26m gain within one year and a loss of 9m 2016: 10m gain between one and five years.
150 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities The following financial assets and liabilities are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements: Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet Gross amounts of recognised financial Gross amounts of liabilities assets Net amounts set off in the presented in the Financial recognised financial assets liabilities balancesheet balance sheet Instruments Net Amount m m m As at 30 September 2017 m m Derivatives financial assets 62 62 53 9 Derivatives financial liabilities 118 118 53 65 Cash and cash equivalents 1,412 5 1,407 1,407 Bank overdrafts 13 5 8 8 Total 1,343 1,343 1,343 Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet Gross amounts of recognised financial Gross amounts of liabilities assets Net amounts recognised financial set off in the presented in the Financial assets liabilities balancesheet balance sheet Instruments Net Amount As at 30 September 2016 m m m m m Derivatives financial assets 171 171 75 96 Derivatives financial liabilities 86 86 75 11 Cash and cash equivalents 1,778 2 1,776 1,776 Bank overdrafts 544 2 542 542 Total 1,319 1,319 1,319 For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements above, each agreement between the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a net basis.
In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis, however, each party to the master netting agreement or similar agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.
22 FINANCIAL RISK The Group is subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, fuel prices, liquidity and counterparty credit within the framework of its business operations.
Interest rate risk The Group is subject to risks arising from interest rate movements in connection with the issue of Eurobonds, bank debt, aircraft financing and cash investments.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage these risks and are designated as both cash flow and fair value hedges.
Foreign exchange rate risk The Group has activities in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
These risks arise in connection with the procurement of services in destinations outside the source market.
For example, US Dollar exposure arises on the procurement of fuel and operating supplies for aircraft, as well as investments in aircraft.
The Group requires segments to identify and appropriately hedge all exposures in line with approved treasury policies designed to reflect the commercial risk of each underlying business.
Each segmental hedging policy includes the hedging build up and permitted instruments.
The maximum hedge tenor is 24 months and each segment should achieve at least an 80% hedge ratio prior to the start of the season.
The Group uses currency forwards, currency swaps and currency options to manage transactional currency risks and these are usually designated as cash flow hedges.
The Group does not hedge translation exposures arising from profits generated outside the UK.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 151 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22 FINANCIAL RISK CONTINUED Fuel price risk Exposure to fuel price risk arises due to flying costs incurred by the Groups aircraft.
The maximum hedge tenor is 24 months and in general each segment should achieve at least an 80% hedge ratio prior to the start of the season.
The Group uses commodity derivative contracts, including fixed price contracts swaps and net purchased options to manage fuel price risk and these are usually designated as cash flow hedges.
The market risks that the Group is subject to have been identified as interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and fuel price risk.
The impact of reasonably possible changes in these risk variables on the Group, based on the period end holdings of financial instruments have been calculated and are set out in the tables below.
In each case it has been assumed that all other variables remain constant.
As at 30 September 2017, the sensitivity of these risks to the defined scenario changes are set out below: Interest rate risk 2017 2016 Impact Impact on profit Impact on profit Impact before tax on equity before tax on equity m m m m 1% 2016: 1% increase in interest rates 9 8 0.25% 2016: 0.25% decrease in interest rates 2 2 Foreign exchange rate risk 2017 2016 Impact Impact on profit Impact on profit Impact before tax on equity before tax on equity m m m m 5% 2016: 5% strengthening of Euro 1 8 112 5% 2016: 5% weakening of Euro 1 7 1 11 5% 2016: 5% strengthening of US Dollar 2 75 380 5% 2016: 5% weakening of US Dollar 1 67 2 72 Fuel price risk 2017 2016 Impact Impact on profit Impact on profit Impact before tax on equity before tax on equity m m m m 10% 2016: 10% increase in fuel price 63 61 10% 2016: 10% decrease in fuel price 63 61 Given recent historical movements in fuel prices Management believes a 10% shift is a reasonable possibility.
152 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22 FINANCIAL RISK CONTINUED Liquidity risk The liquidity position of the Group is significantly influenced by the booking and payment pattern of customers.
As a result, liquidity is at its lowest in the winter months and at its highest in the summer months.
The Group manages the seasonal nature of its liquidity by making use of its bank facility, the terms of which, including the covenant measures, are detailed in the borrowings note refer to Note 19.
The Group also uses liquidity swaps to manage short-term currency positions.
These liquidity swaps are presented as held-for-trading financial instruments.
The undrawn committed debt facility plus the cash available ranged between 993m and 1,824m during the current financial year 2016: 586m2,212m.
Surplus short-term liquidity is invested in accordance with approved treasury policy.
Financial liabilities are analysed below based on the time between the period end and their contractual maturity.
The amounts shown are estimates of the undiscounted future cash flows and will differ from both carrying value and fair value.

For net settled derivative financial instruments, such as fuel swaps and options, the fair value as at the year end of those instruments in a liability position has been disclosed in the table above.
Trade and other payables include non-financial liabilities of 165m 2016: 148m which have not been analysed above.
Counterparty credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to deposits, outstanding derivatives and trade and other receivables.
The maximum exposure in respect of each of these items at the balance sheet date is the carrying value.
The Group assesses its counterparty credit risk exposure in relation to the investment of surplus cash, fuel contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging contracts and undrawn credit facilities.
The Group primarily uses published credit ratings to assess counterparty strength and to define the credit limit for each counterparty in accordance with approved treasury policies.
The Groups approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in Note 16.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 153 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 INSURANCE Management of insurance risk Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland DAC, issues contracts that transfer significant insurance risk and that are classified as insurance contracts.
As a general guideline, the Group defines as significant insurance risk the possibility of having to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.
Business written is travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers.
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume.
Underwriting performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract.
Exposure is capped by specific limits within the insurance policy and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these retention limits.
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Continental Europe.
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the year end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Groups past development pattern.
This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market developments.
The Group has an Actuarial Function to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate.
Any changes to these variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group financial statements.
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the White Horse Insurance Ireland DAC Board of Directors which ensures that reinsurers have a financial stability rating of A S&P.
The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the Groups exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.
24 DEFERRED TAX The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current year: Aircraft Retirement Fair value Other finance benefit of financial temporary Tax leases obligations instruments differences losses Total m m m m m m At 1 October 2016 55 76 14 85 255 177 Charge credit to income 6 1 17 36 50 8 Credit to equity - 32 - - 4 28 Exchange differences 2 2 - 4 2 2 At 30 September 2017 51 45 3 53 211 155 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2017 2016 m m Deferred tax assets 216 228 Deferred tax liabilities 61 51 155 177 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 3,182m restated 2016: 3,274m available for offset against future profits.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised to the extent that the business has forecast future taxable profits against which the assets may be recovered.
As a result of the continuing robustness of the Spanish business it is now considered appropriate for all Spanish losses and deductible temporary differences to be recognised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of 2,222m restated 2016: 2,132m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
2,219m of these losses have no expiry date, with the remaining 3m expiring within 5 years.
154 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED Other temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided primarily relate to the difference in book to tax value on qualifying tax assets, provisions for which tax relief was not originally available, and fair value accounting on assets acquired as part of the merger.
In addition, the Group had unused other temporary differences amounting to 432m 2016: 374m for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets as appropriate within territories.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Factors affecting the tax charge in future periods In addition to the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017, a further reduction to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
Deferred tax on temporary differences and tax losses as at the balance sheet date is calculated based on the substantively enacted rates at which the temporary differences and tax losses are expected to reverse.
The Groups future tax charge could be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to: the UKs proposal to amend the tax rules relating to the utilisation of brought forward losses and the deductibility of interest were substantively enacted on 31 October 2017.
These new rules apply retrospectively from 1 April 2017.
With substantive enactment taking place after the Groups balance sheet date, the accounting standards do not require the impact of these rules to be accounted for until the period ended 30 September 2018.
Due to the complexity of the legislation it is too soon to quantify the impact on UK deferred tax: and any tax reforms in jurisdictions where we have a taxable presence, including any reforms which may arise from the UKs proposed exit from the EU, from the European Commissions proposals for a Common Corporate Tax Base across the EU or any reforms adopted from the OECDs BEPS actions such as those in relation to the deductibility of interest, anti-avoidance or transfer pricing.

In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation including customer claims, employee disputes, taxes and other kinds of lawsuits.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases, a provision is recognised based on best estimates and Managements judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
These are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.

30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, with the defined benefit plans being both funded and unfunded.
The obligations arising from defined contribution plans are satisfied by contribution payments to both private and state-run insurance providers.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2017 2016 m m Present value of funded obligations 1,315 1,442 Fair value of plan assets 1,425 1,470 Surplus Deficit of funded plans 110 28 Present value of unfunded obligations 435 485 Total deficit of defined benefit pension plans 325 457 Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations primarily relate to the Groups employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and the Condor Group.
Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions based on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration of the respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling 367m 2016: 416m were attributable to the pension commitments of the Condor Group Condor Flugdienst GmbH, Condor Berlin GmbH and CF GmbH.
For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the total pension commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in the form of a company pension scheme.
The flight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their in-flight employment and the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension.
In both cases, the benefit commitment depended on the final salaries of the employees concerned prior to the termination of their in-flight employment final salary plan.
Employees who joined a Condor Group company from 1995 onwards participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average salaries of those employees average salary plan.
The Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and transitional provisions.
In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classified as unfunded defined benefit obligations and classified as such in these financial statements.
The Condor Group defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants with the exception of pilots since 2004.
There are additional unfunded defined benefit obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group and obligations in respect of past service for employees in the Group Tour Operator segment.
The unfunded pension schemes are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement benefit obligations in the balance sheet.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 159 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The following weighted average actuarial assumptions were made for the purpose of determining the unfunded defined benefit obligations: 2017 2016 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.19% 1.62% Expected rate of salary increases 2.57% 2.57% Future pension increases 1.51% 1.52% Rate of inflation 1.80% 1.81% The mortality tables 2005 G drawn up by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck were used, for the German pension schemes, as the basis for the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of the pension obligations at 30 September 2017.
These assume a life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 19.3 years for men and 23.4 years for women.
Changes in the present value of unfunded pension obligations were as follows: 2017 2016 m m At beginning of year 485 320 Current service cost 17 11 Interest cost 8 8 Benefits paid 8 7 Settlements 15 Effect of experience adjustments and demographic assumptions 7 1 Effect of financial assumptions 55 105 Exchange difference 10 47 At end of year 435 485 These amounts have been recognised in the income statement.
Service costs, gains on settlement and curtailment gains have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement benefit obligations has been included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Funded defined benefit pension obligation The pension entitlements of employees of Thomas Cook UK and employees in Norway and The Netherlands are provided through funded defined benefit schemes, where pension contributions are paid over to the schemes and the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
These schemes are closed to new entrants and continue to accrue future benefits for existing active members.
The plans are final salary pension plans which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on a members length of service and their salary in the final years of active membership.
In the UK plans, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with retail price index, pensions in deferment are generally updated in line with consumer price index.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries in each country.
The fair value of the pension assets in each scheme at the year end is compared with the present value of the retirement benefit obligations and the net difference reported as a pension asset or retirement benefit obligation as appropriate.
Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that they will result in reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
The funded defined benefit obligation primarily relates to the Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan.
The assumptions used in arriving at the present value of the obligations at 30 September 2017 have been updated following the 2014 triennial actuarial funding valuation.
The mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 30 September 2017 are based on the S2PA pensioner tables with 2013 CMI projection model until 2014 and then 2016 CMI projection model with a long-term trend rate of 1.5% for males and females.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the plan liabilities indicate a further life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 23.3 years for men and 25.2 years for women.
The Company and Board of trustees are responsible for governance of the plans and ensuring it is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefits.
The trustees appoint advisers to carry out the administration actuarial work and investment advice.
160 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Following the 2014 actuarial valuation of the Thomas Cook UK pension plan, the Recovery Plan agreed with the pension trustees to fund the actuarial deficit was extended.
In line with that agreement, during the year ended 30 September 2017 Thomas Cook UK paid instalments totalling 26m in line with the recovery plan.
The valuation of the Thomas Cook UK pension plan at 30 September 2017 resulted in a surplus of 123m 2016: 52m, this is included within the net Group pension deficit of 327m 2016: 457m.
The 123m has been disclosed as a pension asset in the statements of financial position.
The movement in the defined benefit obligation over the year is as follows: 2017 2016 Present value of obligation m m At beginning of year 1,442 1,063 Interest expense income 34 41 34 41 Remeasurements: Gain from change in demographic assumptions 26 Gain loss from change in financial assumptions 72 387 Experience gains losses 10 24 108 363 Exchange differences 6 Payments from plans: Benefit payments 53 31 At end of year 1,315 1,442 2017 2016 Fair value of plan assets m m At beginning of year 1,470 1,104 Interest income 35 43 35 43 Remeasurements: Return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in interest expense income 56 324 56 324 Exchange differences 2 4 Expenses paid 2 3 Contributions: Employers 29 29 Payments from plans: Benefit payments 53 31 At end of year 1,425 1,470 Deficit of funded plan 110 28 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 161 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The weighted average actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2017 2016 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.67 2.37 Inflation rate 3.05 2.96 The average mortality assumptions adopted for the plan liabilities indicate a further life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 23.1years for men and 25 years for women.

The scheme currently has part of its assets invested in a liability driven investment portfolio.
These assets, in combination with the other protection assets in the portfolio, provide interest rate and inflation rate protection.
Sensitivities of the defined benefit obligation The Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long-term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.
See below for more details on the Groups asset-liability matching strategy.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
The majority of the plans assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
162 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.25% Increase by 6% Decrease by 5% Inflation rate 0.25% Decrease by 3% Increase by 4% Mortality 1 year Increase by 2% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of the financial position.
The expected future benefit payments are detailed below: Less than a year At 30 September 2017 m Pension benefit payments 76 The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2016 is 24.6 years.
Defined contribution schemes There are a number of defined contribution schemes in the Group, the principal scheme being the Thomas Cook UK DC Pension Scheme, which is open to all UK employees.
Cash contributions paid into the defined contribution schemes are accounted for as an income statement expense as they are incurred.
The total charge for the year in respect of this and other defined contribution schemes, including liabilities in respect of insured benefits relating to workers compensation arrangements, amounted to 51m 2016: 46m.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.

164 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 33 PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENTS During the year management identified that long term aircraft maintenance provisions had been measured using an incorrect discount rate.
An adjustment has been calculated to restate the carrying value of these provisions using a risk free rate based on government bond rates of similar currency and term to the related obligations.
The impact of this restatement principally affects the opening balance at 1 October 2015 and prior periods and has resulted in a 46m increase in aircraft maintenance provisions recorded within opening reserves as at 1 October 2015.
The effect of applying these revised discount rates would not be material to the results of 2016.
During the year a reassessment of contingent consideration to be settled in the period has been performed.
This has resulted in a 4m reduction to the prior year separately disclosed items, within the income statement, and corresponding reduction in non-controlling interest.
Following the cessation of the Hotels 4U business in the UK at the end of 2016, it was identified during the year that there were a number of balances that were assessed as no longer recoverable.
This resulted in a reduction in prior year profit of 6m, of which 2m was in respect of the impairment of property and recognition of onerous leases recorded in separately disclosed items.
A further 4m was recognised in underlying profit in respect of a reduction in trade and other receivables.
During FY16 an estimate of the TOMS Tour Operator Margin Scheme liability was recognised, however it was subsequently identified that the final liability was understated by 2m.
This has been recorded as an adjustment to underlying profit with a corresponding decrease in trade and other payables.
Management identified a deferral of a profit on a historic sale and leaseback transaction had not been correctly recorded over the life of the lease.
This resulted in an adjustment of 4m being recorded in opening reserves in the prior year.
Amounts of 7m previously recognised receivables have been reassessed as irrecoverable, this included 3m that related to pre-FY16 and therefore has been taken through the opening reserves.
The remaining 4m related to FY16 and resulted in an adjustment to separately disclosed items in 2016.
The errors have been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior periods, as follows: Impact on equity increase decrease in equity 30 September 2016 m Trade and other receivables 11 Plant, property and equipment 1 Short-term provision 1 Current trade and other payables 2 Non-current trade and other payables 4 Long-term provisions 46 Net assets 65 1 Opening reserves 53 Retained earnings 8 Equity attributable to equity owners of the parent 61 Non-controlling interests 4 Total equity 65 1 The impact on opening reserves comprises long term provisions 46m, deferred income in long term trade and other payables 4m and trade and other receivables 3m.
