Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 17 3 Operating assets 3.1 Accounting policies Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on a business combination is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indicators that it may be impaired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that will benefit from the synergies of the business combination for the purpose of impairment testing.
Brands Brands acquired through a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date and amortised to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life.
Software development costs Costs that are directly attributable to the creation of identifiable software, which meet the development asset recognition criteria as laid out in IAS 38 Intangible assets, are recognised as intangible assets.
Direct costs include consultancy costs, the employment costs of internal software developers, and borrowing costs.
All other software development and maintenance costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Software development assets are held at historic cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and are amortised over their estimated useful lives 3 to 10 years on a straight-line basis.
Amortisation is charged in cost of sales.
Licences Separately acquired pharmaceutical licences and software licences are recognised at historic cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Those acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Pharmaceutical licences and software licences are amortised over their useful lives 3 to 10 years on a straight-line basis or over the life of the licence if shorter.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include directly attributable costs such as borrowing costs and employment costs of those people directly working on the construction and installation of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation rates Depreciation rates used to write off cost less residual value on a straight-line basis are: Freehold land 0% Freehold buildings 2.5% Leasehold land Over the lease period Leasehold buildings Over the shorter of lease period and 2.5% Plant, equipment, fixtures and vehicles 10% to 33% Assets under construction 0% Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with an immaterial amount in administration expenses.
Investment property Property held to earn rental income is classified as investment property and is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
The depreciation policy is consistent with that described for property above.
Non-current assets classified as held-for-sale Non-current assets are classified as held-for-sale if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction, rather than continuing use within the Group, and the sale is considered highly probable.
The sale is expected to complete within one year from the date of classification and the assets are available for sale in their current condition.
Non-current assets held-for-sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and are not depreciated.
Lessor accounting operating leases Assets acquired and made available to third parties under operating leases are recorded as property, plant and equipment or investment property and are depreciated on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Operating lease income is credited on a straight-line basis to the date of the next rent review.
Finance leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic life or lease term, whichever is shorter.
The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value and the present value, calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease, of the future minimum lease payments.
The obligations to pay future rentals are included within liabilities.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of finance charge on the remaining balance.
75 Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 17 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 29 January 2017 3 Operating assets continued 3.1 Accounting policies continued Impairment of non-financial assets Intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as goodwill, and those in construction that are not yet being amortised, are tested for impairment annually.
Other non-financial assets are tested if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Testing is performed at the level of a cash generating unit CGU in order to compare the CGUs recoverable amount against its carrying value.
An impaired CGU is written down to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use or its fair value less costs to dispose.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The Group considers that each of its stores is a CGU, which together form a grocery group of CGUs supported by corporate assets such as head office and vertically integrated suppliers.
Impairment losses are reversed if there is evidence of an increase in the recoverable amount of a previously impaired asset, but only to the extent that the recoverable amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.
Any reversal of impairment losses is excluded from underlying earnings.

The Group has performed its annual assessment of its amortisation policies and asset lives and deemed them to be appropriate.
No changes have been made to asset lives during the year.
As in previous years, fully amortised assets are retained in the Groups fixed asset register.
In order to provide greater understanding of the Groups annual amortisation charge, assets which have become fully amortised in the year have been removed from both cost and accumulated amortisation.
Goodwill The goodwill arose on the acquisition of Flower World Limited 3m and Farmers Boy Deeside Limited 7m.
Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill of 10m is allocated to the grocery group of CGUs.
This group of CGUs has been tested for impairment via the value in use calculation described in note 3.3.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.0% 2016: 9.0% and the growth rate applied to the period after five years is 2.0% 2016: 2.0%.
Software development costs The cumulative interest capitalised included within software development costs is 41m 2016: 41m.
The cost of internal labour capitalised is not material for separate disclosure.

As in previous years, fully depreciated assets are retained in the Groups fixed asset register.
In order to provide greater understanding of the Groups annual depreciation charge, assets which have been fully depreciated in the year have been removed from both cost and accumulated depreciation.
Included within the table on page 77 are leasehold land and buildings held under finance lease with a cost of 294m 2016: 308m and accumulated depreciation of 80m 2016: 94m.
The cost of financing property developments prior to their opening date has been included in the cost of the asset.
The cumulative amount of interest capitalised in the total cost above amounts to 198m 2016: 197m.
Impairment The Group considers that each store is a separate cash generating unit CGU and therefore considers every store for an indication of impairment annually.
The Group calculates each stores recoverable amount and compares this amount to its book value.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
If the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment charge is recognised based on the following methodology: Value in use is calculated by projecting individual store pre-tax cash flows over the remaining useful life of the store, based on forecasting assumptions.
The methodology used for calculating future cash flows is to: use the actual cash flows for each store in the current year: allocate a proportion of the Groups central costs to each store on an appropriate basis: project each stores cash flows over the next five years by applying forecast sales and cost growth assumptions: project cash flows beyond year five for the remaining useful life of each store by applying a long term growth rate: and discount the cash flows using a pre-tax rate of 9.0% 2016: 9.0%.
The discount rate takes into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Fair value less costs of disposal is estimated by the Directors based on their knowledge of individual stores and the markets they serve and likely demand from grocers or other retailers.
The Directors also obtain valuations by store prepared by independent valuers and consider these in carrying out their estimate of fair value less cost of disposal for the purposes of testing for impairment.
In determining their valuation, the independent valuers assume an expected rent and yield for each store based on the quality of the asset, local catchment and the store being occupied by a supermarket tenant with a similar covenant to Morrisons.
In order to reflect specific local market conditions, in particular the continued low demand from major grocery retailers for supermarket space, the Directors consider it appropriate for the purpose of testing for impairment to revise downwards the rent and yield assumptions in the independent valuation to reflect the following factors on a store by store basis: Whether a major grocery operator might buy the store, taking into consideration whether they are already located near the store, and whether the store size is appropriate for their business model, and then if not: Assessing whether a smaller store operator might buy the store, in which case the value has been updated to reflect the Directors assessment of the yield which would be achievable if such an operator acquired the store, and then if not: Assessing whether a non-food operator might buy the store, in which case the value has been updated to reflect the Directors assessment of the yield which would be achievable if such an operator acquired the store.
Having applied the above methodology and assumptions, the Group has recognised a net impairment reversal of 44m during the year 2016: nil 191m impairment reversal offset by 147m impairment charge.
This movement reflects fluctuations expected from store level trading performance and local market conditions.
At 29 January 2017, the key assumption to which the value in use calculation is most sensitive to is the discount rate.
Specific sensitivity analysis with regard to this assumption shows that an increase of 1% in the discount rate would result in an additional impairment charge of 56m.
