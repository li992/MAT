Non-statutory information The purpose of this note is to explain, analyse and reconcile a number of non-statutory financial performance and financial position metrics, which are used extensively by the Group to monitor its performance.
These metrics reflect the way in which the Group is run, that the Group is in the real estate sector, and in particular that the Group reviews and reports performance of its joint ventures and associates in the same way as it would if they were subsidiaries.
This means that proportionally consolidated measures often referred to as see-through in the strategic report are particularly relevant whilst also having the benefit of removing the taxation effects on equity accounted entities from the statutory profit before tax figure.
A number of these measures are explained below: Profit before all tax see note 2a : This proportionally consolidated measure adjusts profit before tax to remove taxation on joint venture and associate profits from the profit before tax figure and as such, Group profit before tax of 70.3m 2016: 66.9m can be reconciled to profit before all tax of 67.0m 2016: 60.8m by adjusting profit before tax for the tax credit relating to joint ventures and associates of 3.3m 2016: 6.1m.
Trading profit see note 2a : Trading profit is derived similarly to profit before all tax, but is stated before the principal non-cash income statement items included in this measure, being revaluation gains and losses, changes in the estimate of the obligation to establish the new Covent Garden flower market and non-cash financing charges.
For a property group with a low depreciation charge and no intangible amortisation charge, this therefore represents a more useful measure than the EBITDA alternative performance measure used by many other companies.
A trading cash flow measure is also discussed in note 2f, which represents cash flows before the non-trading items of finance leases, net borrowings and dividends.
St. Modwen Properties PLC 134 Annual report and financial statements 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Property profits see note 2a : This measure represents proportionally consolidated development profits plus proportionally consolidated gains on disposals of investment properties and therefore, like profit before all tax, ostensibly represents the proportionally consolidated amounts in respect of these two income statement lines, after an adjustment for net realisable value provisions.
Total accounting return see note 2e : The Groups shareholders measure their returns in terms of both the Groups growth and the dividend return and total accounting return combines these two items.
Whilst this is often measured by Total Shareholder Return which combines share price growth and dividend return, in the real estate sector, it is also insightful to consider net asset growth, which therefore directly reflects the most recent valuation of assets.
The Groups definition of total accounting return was revised in the year so that it now represents the movement in net asset value per share for the year plus dividends paid per share during the year, expressed as a percentage of net asset value per share at the start of the year.
Previously, this measure was defined using EPRA net asset value rather than net asset value.
This change reflects that the Groups strategy includes the repositioning and recycling of the Groups portfolio towards sectors with strong structural growth, whereas the EPRA model assumes that properties are retained.
In particular, the disposal of a property for its carrying value in the financial statements and the resulting payment of its recognised deferred tax liability does not result in a change in net assets, but does result in a decrease in EPRA net assets because the deferred tax that crystallises on disposal is no longer adjusted for in arriving at EPRA net assets.
Note 2e sets out a total accounting return of 6.0% 2016: 5.6% using the revised definition.
Under the previous definition, total accounting return would have been 3.6% 2016: 4.5%.

Non-statutory information continued i. Gearing and loan-to-value The Groups capacity to borrow is primarily linked to the value of the property portfolio excluding assets held under finance leases.
Accordingly both adjusted gearing and see-through loan-to-value are calculated using the comparable measure of net borrowings and see-through net borrowings respectively.
Reflecting that residential assets are less attractive for security purposes, we also disclose see-through loan-to-value excluding residential using the comparable measure of see-through net borrowings.
These terms are defined as follows: Net borrowings: total borrowings at amortised cost and excluding finance leases and fair value movements on the Groups convertible bond less cash and cash equivalents.
See-through net borrowings: total borrowings at amortised cost excluding finance leases and fair value movements on the Groups convertible bond less cash and cash equivalents including the Groups share of its joint ventures and associates.
This includes the development account beneficially owned by one of our joint ventures VSM NGCM Limited, held for the purpose of funding the establishment of a market at Nine Elms, which would otherwise need to be funded by injecting cash into the joint venture in the future.
Adjusted gearing: the ratio of net borrowings to total equity.
See-through loan-to-value: see-through net borrowings expressed as a percentage of the Groups property portfolio excluding valued assets held under finance leases, calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis including the Groups share of its joint ventures and associates.
See-through loan-to-value excluding residential : see-through net borrowings expressed as a percentage of the Groups property portfolio excluding valued assets held under finance leases and residential land and developments, calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis including the Groups share of its joint ventures and associates.
