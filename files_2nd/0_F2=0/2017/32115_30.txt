The Groups interest in the Twin America joint venture was disposed of during the year.
Each joint venture is structured as a distinct legal entity and the Group accounts for its interests in all three joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
There are no quoted market prices for any of the Groups investments in joint ventures.
a Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited The Group holds 49% of the equity and voting rights in Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited Virgin Rail Group.
The principal business of the group headed by Virgin Rail Group is the operation of inter-city train services under the West Coast rail franchise.
Virgin Rail Group is incorporated in the UK.
The Group considers that it has joint control of Virgin Rail Group even though it controls less than half of the voting rights in Virgin Rail Group.
That joint control results from contractual arrangements between the shareholders of Virgin Rail Group that require the agreement of both shareholders to make decisions on key matters.
Virgin Rail Groups principal subsidiary is West Coast Trains Limited.
Under the terms of its rail franchise agreement, West Coast Trains Limited may only pay dividends and or repay loans from other related companies to the extent it remains compliant with certain financial ratios specified in the franchise agreement.
This could restrict West Coast Trains Limited from making distributions or repaying loans that would be otherwise permitted by company law.
West Coast Trains Limited is also prohibited from loaning money to related companies without the prior consent of the UK Department for Transport.
Such restrictions on distributions and loans generally apply to all entities operating train services under UK rail franchise agreements.
In addition, under arrangements pursuant to which a performance bond has been issued by an insurance company in connection with the West Coast rail franchise, Virgin Rail Group is required to maintain consolidated net assets applying its own accounting policies of no less than 22.5m 2016: 22.5m.
This could restrict Virgin Rail Groups ability to make distributions to the Stagecoach Group.
Subject to the shareholders consideration of how much cash to retain in the business for working capital requirements and subject to retaining sufficient cash to meet any obligations under rail franchise agreements, the distributable profits of Virgin Rail Group are to be distributed in full to its shareholders.
Both shareholders in Virgin Rail Group would need to agree to any changes to or deviations from that dividend policy.
b Twin America LLC Until 15 February 2017, the Group held 60% of the economic interests and 50% of the voting rights in Twin America LLC Twin America.
The principal business of the group headed by Twin America is the operation of sightseeing coach tours in and around the city of New York in the United States.
Twin America is incorporated in the United States.
Contractual arrangements were in place in respect of Twin America which required the agreement of both members to decisions on key matters.
In light of that, the fact voting rights were split 50:50 between the two joint venture members and despite the fact that the Chief Executive of Twin America is a representative of the other member, the Group considered that it had joint control of Twin America.
c Scottish Citylink Coaches Limited The Group holds 35% of the equity and voting rights in Scottish Citylink Coaches Limited Citylink.
The principal business of Citylink is the operation of inter-city coach services to, from and within Scotland.
It is incorporated in the UK.
The Group considers that it has joint control of Citylink even although it controls less than half of the voting rights in Citylink but is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business.
That joint control results from contractual arrangements between the shareholders of Citylink that require the agreement of both shareholders to make decisions on key matters.
The profit after tax of Citylink is distributed in full to its shareholders subject to retaining sufficient cash to meet the liquidity requirements of the business and subject to there being no outstanding amounts payable by Citylink in respect of loans from its shareholders and accrued interest on such loans.
Both shareholders in Citylink need to agree to any changes to or deviations from that dividend policy.
