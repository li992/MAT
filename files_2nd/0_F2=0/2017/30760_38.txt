Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 9 Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split between a calculated longer-term return, which is included in Group adjusted operating profit, and short-term fluctuations from this, which are disclosed outside Group adjusted operating profit but are included in profit before tax.
This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: 2017 2016 Non-long-term business m m Short-term fluctuations in investment return see b below 345 518 Economic assumption changes see g below 7 242 352 760 b The longer-term investment return and short-term fluctuation are as follows: 2017 2016 Non-long-term business m m Analysis of investment income: Net investment income expenses 49 136 Foreign exchange gains losses and other charges 24 35 25 171 Analysed between: Longer-term investment return, reported within operating profit 370 347 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit General insurance and health 57 5 1 Other operations 288 523 345 518 25 171 1 Represents short-term fluctuations on assets backing non-long-term business in Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme and Group external borrowings.
c The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer-term return for other investments including debt securities is the actual income receivable for the year.
Actual income and longer-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities.
For other operations, the longer-term return reflects assets backing non-long-term business held in Group centre investments.
Market value movements which give rise to variances between actual and longer-term investment returns are disclosed separately in short-term fluctuations outside operating profit.
The impact of realised and unrealised gains and losses on Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme which is designed to economically protect the total Groups capital against adverse equity and foreign exchange movements, is included in shortterm fluctuations on other operations.
The adverse short-term fluctuations during 2017 are mainly due to foreign exchange losses and adverse market movements on Group centre holdings, including the centre hedging programme.

2 Represents assets backing non-long-term business in Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the longer-term investment return are: Longer-term rates Longer-term rates of return Equities of return Properties 2017 2016 2017 2016 % % % % United Kingdom 4.8 5.5 3.3 4.0 Eurozone 4.2 4.5 2.7 3.0 Canada 5.5 5.4 4.0 3.9 The longer-term rates of return on equities and properties have been calculated by reference to the ten year mid-price swap rate for an AArated bank in the relevant currency plus a risk premium.
The underlying reference rates and risk premiums are shown in note 8. e The table below compares the actual return on investments attributable to the non-long-term business, after deducting investment management expenses and charges, with the aggregate longer-term return over a five year period.
2013-2017 2012-2016 m m Actual return attributable to shareholders 1,148 1,853 Longer-term return credited to operating results 2,170 2,523 Excess of longer-term returns over actual returns 1,022 670 Management continues to view the excess of longer-term returns over actual returns as short-term fluctuations.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the longer-term investment returns are reviewed on a regular basis, having regard to local economic and market forecasts, and are considered appropriate for the purpose of decision making and internal performance management by the Group chief operating decision maker.
f The table below shows the sensitivity of the Groups adjusted non-long-term business Group adjusted operating profit before tax to changes in the longer-term rates of return: 2017 2016 Movement in investment return for By Change in m m Equities 1% higher lower Group adjusted operating profit before tax 3 2 Properties 1% higher lower Group adjusted operating profit before tax 3 3 g The economic assumption changes arise as a result of a slight decrease in the estimated future inflation rate used to value periodic payment orders offset by a slight decrease in the interest rates used to discount claim reserves for periodic payment orders and latent claims.
As explained in accounting policy L, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below Group adjusted operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 40.
