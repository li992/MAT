Strategic report Governance IFRS financial statements Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 14 Earnings per share This note shows how we calculate earnings per share on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, based both on the present shares in issue the basic earnings per share and the potential future shares in issue, including conversion of share options granted to employees the diluted earnings per share.
We have also shown the same calculations based on our Group adjusted operating profit as we believe this gives a better indication of operating performance.
Consideration of both these measures gives a full picture of the performance of the business in the period.
