It excludes the operating investment return on shareholder net assets, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets.
Fee income represents profits driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses.
With-profits business represents the gross of tax shareholders transfer from the withprofits fund for the year.
Insurance margin primarily represents profits derived from the insurance risks of mortality and morbidity.
Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses.
Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the year attributable to shareholders.
It excludes items such as restructuring costs and Solvency II costs which are not included in the segment profit for insurance, as well as items that are more appropriately included in other sources of earnings lines eg investment expenses are netted against investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate.
DAC adjustments comprise DAC amortisation for the year, excluding amounts related to shortterm fluctuations in investment returns, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.
Analysis of pre-tax IFRS operating profit by source and margin analysis of Group long-term insurance business The following analysis expresses certain of the Groups sources of operating profit as a margin of policyholder liabilities or other relevant drivers.

Analysis of Asia operating profit drivers: Spread income has increased on a constant exchange rate basis by 9 per cent AER: 15 per cent to 220 million in 2017, predominantly reflecting the growth of the Asia nonlinked policyholder liabilities.
Fee income has increased by 10 per cent at constant exchange rates AER: 14 per cent to 199 million in 2017, broadly in line with the increase in movement in average unitlinked liabilities.
Insurance margin has increased by 21 per cent to 1,310 million in 2017 on a constant exchange rate basis AER: 26 per cent, primarily reflecting the continued growth of the inforce book, which contains a relatively high proportion of riskbased products.
Margin on revenues has increased by 93 million on a constant exchange rate basis from 2,004 million in 2016 to 2,097 million in 2017, primarily reflecting growth of the inforce book and higher regular premium income recognised in the year.
Acquisition costs have increased by 11 per cent at constant exchange rates AER: 16 per cent to 1,489 million, compared to the 1 per cent increase in APE sales, resulting in an increase in the acquisition costs ratio.
The analysis above uses shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE.
If withprofits sales were excluded from the denominator the acquisition cost ratio would become 66 per cent 2016: 70 per cent at CER, the decrease being the result of product and country mix.
Administration expenses including renewal commissions have increased by 11 per cent at a constant exchange rate basis AER: 15 per cent increase in 2017 as the business continues to expand.
On a constant exchange rate basis, the administration expense ratio has decreased from 284 basis points in 2016 to 273 basis points in 2017, the result of changes in country and product mix.

Analysis of US operating profit drivers: Spread income has decreased by 10 per cent at constant exchange rates AER: decreased by 6 per cent to 751 million during 2017.
The reported spread margin decreased to 193 basis points from 217 basis points in 2016, due to lower yields in the investment portfolio.
Spread income benefited from swap transactions previously entered into so that asset and liability duration can be more closely matched.
Excluding this effect, the spread margin would have been 144 basis points 2016 CER: 152 basis points and AER: 153 basis points.
Fee income has increased by 15 per cent at constant exchange rates AER: increased by 21 per cent to 2,343 million during 2017, primarily due to higher average separate account balances due to positive net flows from variable annuity business and market appreciation during the year.
Insurance margin represents operating profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry items.
Insurance margin decreased to 906 million in 2017 from 933 million in 2016 on a constant exchange rate basis, with higher income from the variable annuity guarantees being more than offset by a decline in the contribution from the closed books of business.
Acquisition costs, which are commissions and expenses incurred to acquire new business, including those that are not deferrable, have decreased by 5 per cent at a constant exchange rate basis, largely due to the continued increase in producers selecting assetbased commissions, which are paid upon policy anniversary dates and are treated as an administration expense in this analysis, rather than front end commissions.
Administration expenses increased to 1,174 million during 2017, compared to 1,007 million for 2016 at a constant exchange rate AER: 959 million, primarily as a result of higher asset based commissions.
Excluding these assetbased commissions, the resulting administration expense ratio was relatively flat at 35 basis points 2016: 34 basis points at CER and AER.

Broadly: a Spread business is the net operating profit for fixed annuity, fixed indexed annuity and guaranteed investment contracts and largely comprises spread income less costs.
b Fee business represents profits from variable annuity products.
As well as fee income, revenue for this product line includes spread income from investments directed to the general account and other variable annuity fees included in insurance margin.
c Life and other business includes the profits from the REALIC business and other closed life books.
Revenue allocated to this product line includes spread income and premiums and policy charges for life protection, which are included in insurance margin after claim costs.
Insurance margin forms the vast majority of revenue.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Analysis of UK and Europe operating profit drivers: Spread income reduced from 177 million in 2016 to 137 million in 2017, mainly due to lower annuity sales.
Spread income has two components: A contribution from new annuity business which was lower at 9 million in 2017 compared to 41 million in 2016, reflecting our effective withdrawal from this market.
A contribution from inforce annuity and other business, which was broadly in line with last year at 128 million 2016: 136 million, equivalent to 38 basis points of average reserves 2016: 42 basis points.
Fee income principally represents asset management fees from unitlinked business, including direct investment only business to group pension schemes, where liability flows are driven by a small number of large single mandate transactions and fee income mostly arises within our UK asset management business.
Excluding these schemes, the fee margin on the remaining balances was 39 bps 2016: 40 bps.
Margin on revenues represents premium charges for expenses of shareholderbacked business and other sundry net income.
Acquisition costs decreased from 89 million in 2016 to 68 million in 2017, equivalent to 5 per cent of total APE sales in 2017 2016: 8 per cent.
The ratio above expresses the percentage of shareholder acquisition costs as a percentage of total APE sales.
It is therefore impacted by the level of withprofits business in the year.
Acquisition costs expressed as a percentage of shareholderbacked APE sales remained broadly consistent at 38 per cent 2016: 37 per cent.
The contribution from longevity reinsurance and other management actions to improve solvency during 2017 was 276 million 2016: 332 million.
Further explanation and analysis is provided in Additional unaudited financial information section I d. The 204 million favourable longevity assumption changes reflect the adoption of the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2015 model.
Further information on changes to mortality assumptions is given in note C4.1 d. The 2017 increase in the provision for the cost of undertaking a review of past nonadvised annuity sales and related potential redress of 225 million 2016: 175 million is explained in note C11, Provisions.
Notes to sources of earnings tables i The ratio for acquisition costs is calculated as a percentage of APE sales including withprofits sales.
Acquisition costs include only those relating to shareholderbacked business.
ii Margin represents the operating return earned in the year as a proportion of the relevant class of policyholder liabilities excluding unallocated surplus.
iii The 2016 comparative information has been presented at AER and CER so as to eliminate the impact of exchange translation.
CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using the current year foreign exchange rates.
All CER profit figures have been translated at current year average rates.
For Asia CER average liability calculations, the policyholder liabilities have been translated using current year opening and closing exchange rates.
For the US CER average liability calculations, the policyholder liabilities have been translated at the current year month end closing exchange rates.
iv For UK and Europe and Asia, opening and closing policyholder liabilities have been used to derive an average balance for the year, as a proxy for average balances throughout the year.
The calculation of average liabilities for Jackson is generally derived from month end balances throughout the year, as opposed to opening and closing balances only.
The average liabilities for fee income in Jackson have been calculated using daily balances instead of month end balances in order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the fee income, which is charged on the daily account balance.
Average liabilities for spread income are based on the general account liabilities to which spread income attaches.
Average liabilities used to calculate the administration expense margin exclude the REALIC liabilities reinsured to third parties prior to the acquisition by Jackson.
Average liabilities are adjusted for business acquisitions and disposals in the year.
v The DAC adjustments contain a credit of 43 million in respect of joint ventures and an associate in 2017 2016: AER credit of 28 million.

These actions included extending the reinsurance of longevity risk to cover a further 0.5 billion of IFRS annuity liabilities.
As at 31 December 2017, the total IFRS annuity liabilities subject to longevity reinsurance were 14.4 billion.
Management actions also repositioned the fixed income asset portfolio to improve the tradeoff between yield and credit risk.
The effect of these actions on the UKs longterm IFRS operating profit, underlying free surplus generation and EEV operating profit before restructuring costs is shown in the tables below.

The solvency positions include managements estimates of UK transitional measures reflecting operating and market conditions at each valuation date.
An application to recalculate the transitional measures as at 31 December 2017 has been approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority.
In accordance with Solvency II requirements, these results allow for: Capital in Jackson in excess of 250 per cent of the US local Risk Based Capital requirement.
As agreed with the Prudential Regulation Authority, this is incorporated in the result above as follows: Own funds: represents Jacksons local US Risk Based available capital less 100 per cent of the US Risk Based Capital requirement Company Action Level : Solvency Capital Requirement: represents 150 per cent of Jacksons local US Risk Based Capital requirement Company Action Level : and No diversification benefits are taken into account between Jackson and the rest of the Group.

An application to recalculate the transitional measures as at 31 December 2017 has been approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority and this recalculation will therefore be reflected in the formal regulatory Quantitative Reporting Templates as at 31 December 2017.
The Group shareholder Solvency II capital position excludes: A portion of Solvency II surplus capital 1.7 billion at 31 December 2017 relating to the Groups Asian life operations, including due to the Solvency II definition of contract boundaries, which prevents some expected future cash flows from being recognised: The contribution to Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement from ringfenced withprofits funds in surplus representing 4.8 billion of surplus capital from UK withprofits funds at 31 December 2017 and from the shareholders share of the estate of withprofits funds: and The contribution to Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement from pension funds in surplus.
It also excludes unrealised gains on certain derivative instruments taken out to protect Jackson against declines in longterm interest rates.
At Jacksons request, the Department of Insurance Financial Services renewed its approval to carry these instruments at book value in the local statutory returns for the period 31 December 2017 to 1 October 2018.
At 31 December 2017, this approval had the effect of decreasing local statutory capital and surplus and by extension Solvency II Own Funds and Solvency II surplus by 0.4 billion, net of tax.
This arrangement reflects an elective longstanding practice first put in place in 2009, which can be unwound at Jacksons discretion.
The 31 December 2017 Solvency II results above allow for the completion of the sale of the Korea life business and sale of the US brokerdealer network in 2017, which contributes 0.1 billion to the Group Solvency II surplus.
The results also allow for the impact of US tax reforms enacted in December 2017, which reduce the Group Solvency II surplus by 0.6 billion.
Further information on the Solvency II capital position for the Group and The Prudential Assurance Company Limited is published annually in the Solvency and Financial Condition Reports.
These were last published on the Groups website on 18 May 2017.

2 Subject to a floor of zero.
3 Allowing for further transitional recalculation after the interest rate stress.
4 US Risk Based Capital solvency position included using a stress of 10 times expected credit defaults.
The Group believes it is positioned to withstand significant deteriorations in market conditions and we continue to use market hedges to manage some of this exposure across the Group, where we believe the benefit of the protection outweighs the cost.
The sensitivity analysis above allows for predetermined management actions and those taken to date, but does not reflect all possible management actions which could be taken in the future.

While there is a large surplus in the UK withprofits funds, this is ringfenced from the shareholder balance sheet and is therefore excluded from both the Group and the UK shareholder Solvency II surplus results.

The templates will require us to combine the Group shareholder solvency position with those of all other ringfenced funds across the Group.
In combining these solvency positions, the contribution to own funds from these ringfenced funds will be set equal to their aggregate Solvency Capital Requirements, estimated at 6.6 billion ie the solvency surplus in these ringfenced funds will not be captured in the templates.
There will be no impact on the reported Group Solvency II surplus.
Statement of independent review in respect of Solvency II Capital Position at 31 December 2017 The methodology, assumptions and overall result have been subject to examination by KPMG LLP.

co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 379 Additional unaudited financial information continued II Other information continued II g Reconciliation of expected transfer of value of in-force business VIF and required capital to free surplus The tables below show how the value of inforce business VIF generated by the inforce longterm business and the associated required capital is modelled as emerging into free surplus over the next 40 years.
Although a small amount less than 4 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown in the tables is considered most meaningful.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities used to prepare our 2017 results.
In addition to showing the amounts, both discounted and undiscounted, expected to be generated from all inforce business at 31 December 2017, the tables also present the expected future free surplus to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2017 over the same 40year period for longterm business operations.
In particular, it excludes the value of the shareholders interest in the withprofits estate.
It also excludes any free surplus emerging after 2057.
The above amounts can be reconciled to the new business amounts as follows: 2017 m UK and Asia US Europe Total Undiscounted expected free surplus generation for years 2018 to 2057 5,507 2,017 861 8,385 Less: discount effect 3,153 689 339 4,181 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2018 to 2057 2,354 1,328 522 4,204 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years after 2057 442 1 443 Less: Free surplus investment in new business 484 254 175 913 Other items 56 168 6 118 Posttax EEV new business profit for longterm business operations 2,368 906 342 3,616 Other items represent the impact of the time value of options and guarantees on new business, foreign exchange effects and other nonmodelled items.

co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 381 Additional unaudited financial information continued II Other information continued II g Reconciliation of expected transfer of value of in-force business VIF and required capital to free surplus continued At 31 December 2017, the total free surplus expected to be generated over the next five years 2018 to 2022 inclusive, using the same assumptions and methodology as those underpinning our 2017 embedded value reporting was 17.2 billion, an increase of 1.4 billion from the 15.8 billion expected over an equivalent period from the end of 2016.
This increase primarily reflects the new business written in 2017, which is expected to generate 1,838 million of free surplus over the next five years.
At 31 December 2017, the total free surplus expected to be generated on an undiscounted basis in the next 40 years is 70.1 billion, up from the 64.0 billion expected at the end of 2016, reflecting the effect of new business written across all three business operations of 8.4 billion, a negative foreign exchange translation effect of 3.1 billion and a 3.7 billion net effect reflecting operating, market assumption changes and other items.
In Asia, these include the effect of changes in operating assumptions reflecting the net benefit arising from annual review of experience, together with the benefit of management actions.
In the US, these mainly reflect the positive effect from persistency assumption updates and increase in equity market returns, together with the benefits from US tax reform, partially offset by lower future separate account return due to the decrease in interest rates.
In the UK and Europe, these reflect the impact of management actions which had the effect of accelerating the generation of future free surplus into 2017, partially offset by higher than assumed investment returns on withprofits funds.
The overall growth in the Groups undiscounted value of free surplus reflects our ability to write both growing and profitable new business.
Actual underlying free surplus generated in 2017 from life business in force before restructuring costs at the end of 2017 was 4.1 billion including 0.6 billion of changes in operating assumptions and experience variances.
This compares with the expected 2017 realisation at the end of 2016 of 3.4 billion.

Separately on the IFRS basis, operating profit also excludes amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments.
In addition, for EEV basis results, operating profit excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions, the market value movement on core borrowings and in 2012, the gain arising on the acquisition of REALIC.

The value of inforce business reflects the present value of future shareholder cash flows from longterm inforce business which are not captured as shareholders interest on an IFRS basis.
Net worth represents the net assets for EEV reporting purposes that reflect the regulatory basis position, sometimes with adjustments to achieve consistency with the IFRS treatment of certain items.
b Other adjustments represent asset and liability valuation differences between IFRS and the local regulatory reporting basis used to value net worth for longterm insurance operations.
For the UK, this would be the difference between IFRS and Solvency II.
It also includes the mark to market of the Groups core structural borrowings which are fair valued under EEV but not IFRS.
The most significant valuation differences relate to changes in the valuation of insurance liabilities.
For example, in Jackson where IFRS liabilities are higher than the local regulatory basis as they are principally based on policyholder account balances with a deferred acquisition costs recognised as an asset whereas the local regulatory basis used for EEV is based on future cash flows due to the policyholder on a prudent basis with consideration of an expense allowance as applicable, but with no separate deferred acquisition cost asset.
II l Reconciliation of APE new business sales to earned premiums The Group reports APE new business sales as a measure of the new policies sold in the year.
This differs from the IFRS measure of premiums earned as shown below: 2017 m 2016 m Annual premium equivalents as published 6,958 6,320 note a Adjustment to include 100% of single premiums on new business sold in the year 28,769 25,057 note b Premiums from inforce business and other adjustments 8,278 7,604 Gross premiums earned 44,005 38,981 Outward reinsurance premiums 2,062 2,020 Earned premiums, net of reinsurance as shown in the IFRS financial statements 41,943 36,961 Notes a A PE new business sales only include one tenth of single premiums, recorded on policies sold in the year.
Gross premiums earned include 100 per cent of such premiums.
b Other adjustments principally include amounts in respect of the following: G ross premiums earned include premiums from existing inforce business as well as new business.
The most significant amount is recorded in Asia, where a significant portion of regular premium business is written.
Asia inforce premiums form the vast majority of the other adjustment amount: A PE includes new policies written in the year which are classified as investment contracts without discretionary participation features under IFRS 4, arising mainly in Jackson for guaranteed investment contracts and in M&G Prudential for certain unitlinked savings and similar contracts.
These are excluded from gross premiums earned and recorded as deposits: A PE new business sales are annualised while gross premiums earned are recorded only when revenues are due: and F or the purpose of reporting APE new business sales, we include the Groups share of amounts sold by the Groups insurance joint ventures and associates.
Under IFRS, joint ventures and associates are equity accounted and so no amounts are included within gross premiums earned.
