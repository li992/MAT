Net interest income Accounting policy Interest income and expense on available-for-sale assets, held-to-maturity assets and financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost, is recognised using the effective interest method.
Interest income and expense on financial instruments held at fair value through pro t or loss is recognised within net interest income.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash ows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, prepayment options but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Where the estimates of cash ows have been revised, the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability is adjusted to re ect the actual and revised cash ows, discounted at the instruments original effective interest rate.
The adjustment is recognised as interest income or expense in the period in which the revision is made.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash ows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
