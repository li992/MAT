170 intu properties plc Annual report 2017 170 intu properties plc Annual report 2017 EPRA performance measures unaudited 1 Summary The EPRA Best Practice Recommendations identify six key performance measures, including the EPRA cost ratios.
The measures are deemed to be of importance for investors in European property companies and aim to encourage more consistent and widespread disclosure.
The Group is supportive of this initiative but continues to disclose additional measures throughout this report which it believes are more appropriate to the Groups current circumstances.
In 2017, the Group retained its EPRA Gold Award for exceptional compliance with the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations.
The EPRA measures are summarised below and detailed in the tables following: Table 2017 2016 EPRA cost ratio including direct vacancy costs 2 19.4% 18.6% EPRA cost ratio excluding direct vacancy costs 2 15.1% 15.0% EPRA earnings 3 192.3m 192.9m per share 3 14.3p 14.5p EPRA NAV 4 a 5,287.3m 5,200.9m per share 4 a 393p 386p EPRA NNNAV 4 b 4,695.8m 4,698.9m per share 4 b 349p 349p EPRA net initial yield 5 4.2% 4.3% EPRA topped-up NIY 5 4.4% 4.5% EPRA vacancy rate 6 3.0% 3.0% Details of the Groups performance against the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations on Sustainability Reporting can be found in full in the 2017 corporate responsibility report.

However, we believe that our measure of underlying earnings per share, as presented in note 12 c, is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business.
The key difference relates to the adjustments in respect of exceptional items where EPRA is prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made limiting these to acquisition-related costs and costs incurred on termination of derivative financial instruments.

However, we believe that our measure of NAV per share diluted, adjusted, as presented in note 13 a, is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business.
The key difference relates to interest rate swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt which are excluded in the Groups definition of NAV per share diluted, adjusted.
The adjustment in respect of the non-controlling interest recoverable balance not recognised is due to historical accounting practices and is required, in our view, to give a more appropriate value of net assets attributable to equity owners of the Group.
