They are prepared under the historical cost basis, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and certain related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
As permitted by section 408 4 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the Company has not been included in these financial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are described below.
They have all been applied consistently to all years presented.
Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill arising on business combinations and operating intangibles.
Goodwill is defined under Business combinations on page 112 of the consolidated financial statements.
The Companies Act 2006 requires goodwill to be amortised on a systematic basis over its useful economic life.
Under FRS 101 goodwill is not amortised, but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever there are indicators of impairment.
The Company is therefore invoking a true and fair view override to overcome the requirement to amortise goodwill in the Companies Act 2006.
Had the Company amortised goodwill, a period of three years would have been chosen as its useful life from the date of transition.
The loss for the year would have been 4m higher had goodwill been amortised in the year.
Intangible assets other than goodwill are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are generally deemed to be no longer than five years.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities, except for derivatives, are measured initially at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs, and thereafter at amortised cost.
Derivatives Derivatives are used to manage the Companys economic exposure to financial risks.
The principal instruments used are foreign exchange contracts and swaps.
Derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value based on market prices or rates, or calculated using either discounted cash flow or option pricing models.
Changes in the value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement unless they qualify for hedge accounting when recognition of any change in fair value depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Company operates one defined contribution and two defined benefit pension schemes.
The Company is the principal employer of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded final salary scheme that is closed to new members, as well as a small unfunded final salary scheme.
For the defined benefit plans, the amount charged in the income statement is the cost of benefits accruing to employees over the year, plus any benefit improvements granted to members by the Company during the year.
It also includes net interest expense or income calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net pension asset or liability.
The difference between market value of assets and present value of liabilities is disclosed as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
Any related deferred tax to the extent recoverable is disclosed separately in the balance sheet.
Remeasurements are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Surpluses are recognised only to the extent that they are recoverable.
Contributions payable by the group in respect of defined contribution plans are charged to operating profit as incurred.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 161 161 Income tax Income tax on profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items taken directly to equity.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Share-based payments The fair value of the share awards at grant date is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity, spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The amount recognised is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting except where the failure to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition.
Where the Company grants allocations of shares to employees of its subsidiaries, these are accounted for on the same basis as allocations to employees of the Company, except that the fair value is recognised as an increase to investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in equity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank and cash balances, call deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.

The Company had provided 857m of guarantees in the ordinary course of business as at 16 September 2017 2016 709m.
