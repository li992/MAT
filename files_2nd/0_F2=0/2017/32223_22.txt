British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 107 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2 Performance measures Earnings per share The Group measures financial performance with reference to underlying earnings per share, the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA earnings per share and IFRS earnings per share.
The relevant earnings and weighted average number of shares including dilution adjustments for each performance measure are shown below, and a reconciliation between these is shown within the supplementary disclosures Table B. EPRA earnings per share is calculated using EPRA earnings, which is the IFRS profit after taxation attributable to shareholders of the Company excluding investment and development property revaluations, gains losses on investing and trading property disposals, changes in the fair value of financial instruments and associated close-out costs and their related taxation.
In the current year, diluted EPRA earnings per share did not include the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Groups share price was below the exchange price of 693 pence.
IFRS diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive impact as IAS 33 ignores this hurdle to conversion.
In the prior year, both measures included the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Groups share price was above the exchange price.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated using Underlying Profit adjusted for underlying taxation see note 7.
Underlying Profit is the pre-tax EPRA earnings measure, with additional Company adjustments.
No Company adjustments were made in either the current or prior year.

Net asset value The Group measures financial position with reference to EPRA net asset value NAV per share and EPRA triple net asset value NNNAV per share.
The net asset value and number of shares for each performance measure is shown below.
A reconciliation between IFRS net assets and EPRA net assets, and the relevant number of shares for each performance measure, is shown within the supplementary disclosures Table B. EPRA net assets is a proportionally consolidated measure that is based on IFRS net assets excluding the mark-to-market on effective cash flow hedges and related debt adjustments, the mark-to-market on the convertible bonds as well as deferred taxation on property and derivative valuations.
They include the valuation surplus on trading properties and are adjusted for the dilutive impact of share options.
As at 31 March 2017, EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV did not include the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Group's share price was below the exchange price of 693 pence.
IFRS net assets includes the dilutive impact following the treatment of IFRS earnings per share.
In the prior year period, both measures included the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Group's share price was above the exchange price.

9 Pensions The British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme the scheme is the principal defined benefit pension scheme in the Group.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund and kept separate from those of the Company.
It is not contracted out of SERPS State EarningsRelated Pension Scheme and it is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
The Group has three other small defined benefit pension schemes.
There is also a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme.
Contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary for non-Directors and are paid by the Company.
The total net pension cost charged for the year was 7m 2015 16: 7m, of which 4m 2015 16: 4m relates to defined contribution plans and 3m 2015 16: 3m relates to the current service cost of the defined benefit schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2015 by consulting actuaries, AON Hewitt Associates Ltd.
The employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 72.9% per annum of basic salaries.
The best estimate of employer contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 March 2018 is 5m.
The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 2.4 3.2 3.1 4.4 4.1 Salary inflation 4.9 4.8 4.8 5.2 4.7 Pensions increase 3.3 3.2 3.2 3.5 3.1 Price inflation 3.4 3.3 3.3 3.7 3.2 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 60 will live on average for a further 29.7 years if they are male and for a further 31.7 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2037 at age 60, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 31.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 33.2 years after retirement if they are female.

The scheme holds a significant portion of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds which, although expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

Level 2: I nputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
These levels are specified in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Property valuations are inherently subjective as they are made on the basis of assumptions made by the valuer which may not prove to be accurate.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
The inputs to the valuations are defined as 'unobservable' by IFRS 13 and these are analysed in a table on the following page.
There were no transfers between levels in the period.
The Groups total property portfolio was valued by external valuers on the basis of fair value, in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014, ninth edition, published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The information provided to the valuers, and the assumptions and valuations models used by the valuers are reviewed by the property portfolio team, the Head of Offices, the Head of Retail and the Chief Financial Officer.
The valuers meet with the external auditors and also present directly to the Audit Committee at the interim and year end review of results.
Further details of the Audit Committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 67 to 70.
Investment properties, excluding properties held for development, are valued by adopting the investment method of valuation.
This approach involves applying capitalisation yields to current and future rental streams net of income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods and associated running costs.
These capitalisation yields and future rental values are based on comparable property and leasing transactions in the market using the valuers professional judgement and market observation.
Other factors taken into account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy details and ground and structural conditions.
116 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 Property continued In the case of ongoing developments, the approach applied is the residual method of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as described above, with a deduction for all costs necessary to complete the development, including a notional finance cost, together with a further allowance for remaining risk.
Properties held for development are generally valued by adopting the higher of the residual method of valuation, allowing for all associated risks, or the investment method of valuation for the existing asset.

118 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 Property continued All other factors being equal: a higher equivalent yield or discount rate would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset: an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value: and an increase in the costs to complete would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset.
However, there are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact on these changes.
There were no transfers between valuation levels in the period.
Additional property disclosures including covenant information At 31 March 2017, the Group property portfolio valuation of 9,520m 2015 16: 10,111m comprises freeholds of 5,576m 2015 16: 6,184m : virtual freeholds of 809m 2015 16: 906m : and long leaseholds of 3,135m 2015 16 3,021m.
The historical cost of properties was 6,024m 2015 16: 6,544m.
The property valuation does not include any investment properties held under operating leases 2015 16: nil.
Cumulative interest capitalised against investment, development and trading properties amounts to 95m 2015 16: 88m.
Properties valued at 1,882m 2015 16: 2,559m were subject to a security interest and other properties of non-recourse companies amounted to 1,158m 2015 16: 1,244m, totalling 3,040m 2015 16: 3,803m.
Included within the property valuation is 62m 2015 16: 110m in respect of accrued contracted rental uplift income.
The balance arises through the IFRS treatment of leases containing such arrangements, which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the difference between this and the cash receipt changing the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.

132 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17 Net debt continued Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt and equity attributable to the equity holders of The British Land Company PLC, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Risks relating to capital structure are addressed within Managing risk in delivering Our strategy on pages 46 to 49.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing debt are set out in the Financial policies and principles on pages 43 to 45.
Interest rate risk management The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities and floating rate bonds caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2017, the fair value of these derivatives is a net liability of 143m.
Interest rate swaps with a fair value of 143m have been designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 March 2017 was nil 2015 16: nil.
The cash flows occur and are charged to profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises variable rate debt hedged at 31 March 2017.
Cash flow hedged debt 2017 2016 m m Outstanding: at one year 450 413 at two years 450 663 at five years 250 250 at ten years 250 250 Fair value hedged debt The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure on fixed rate financial liabilities caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2017, the fair value of these derivatives is a net asset of 216m.
Interest rate swaps with a fair value of 215m have been designated as fair value hedges under IAS 39 2015 16: asset of 164m.
The cross currency swaps of the 2018 2021 2023 2026 US Private Placements fully hedge the foreign exchange exposure at an average floating rate of 146 basis points above LIBOR.
These have been designated as fair value hedges of the US Private Placements.
Interest rate profile including effect of derivatives 2017 2016 m m Fixed or capped rate 1,604 2,372 Variable rate net of cash 1,490 1,245 3,094 3,617 All the debt is effectively Sterling denominated except for 11m 2015 16: 10m of Euro debt of which 11m is at a fixed rate 2015 16: 10m.
At 31 March 2017 the weighted average interest rate of the Sterling fixed rate debt is 3.3% 2015 16: 3.5%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 8.3 years 2015 16: 9.1 years.
The floating rate debt is set for periods of the Companys choosing at the relevant LIBOR or similar rate.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 78% at 31 March 2017 on a spot basis, pro forma for the Leadenhall transaction see page 124.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest as an average over the next five year forecast period, on a proportionally consolidated basis, was 60% at 31 March 2017.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile, at the balance sheet date, a 576 bps increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 87m 2015 16: 72m decrease.
Similarly, a 34 bps reduction would increase profits by 5m 2015 16: 7m increase.
The change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three month Sterling LIBOR over the last ten years.
The impact assumes LIBOR does not fall below 0%.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 133 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 17 Net debt continued Interest rate profile including effect of derivatives continued Upward movements in medium and long term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectations, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
The majority of the Groups interest rate swaps which provide such protection qualify as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 therefore movements in the fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
A 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the seven year Sterling swap rate over the last ten years.
At 31 March 2017 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of these interest rate swaps by 82m 2015 16: 151m.
A 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value of these interest rate swaps by 131m 2015 16: 197m.
Because the interest rate swaps are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flows of such movements is minimal.
The 1.5% 2012 Convertible Bond and 0% 2015 Convertible Bond are both designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Principal components of the market value of both bonds include British Lands share price and its volatility, and market interest rates.
The fair value of the 1.5% 2012 Convertible Bond at 31 March 2017 was a 406m liability.
At 31 March 2017 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in interest rates would reduce the fair value liability by 4m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the fair value liability by 4m.
The fair value of the 0% 2015 Convertible Bond at 31 March 2017 was a 331m liability.
At 31 March 2017 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in interest rates would reduce the fair value liability by 21m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the fair value liability by 22m.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups policy is to have no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives.
The Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance with IAS 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Provided contingent tax on overseas investments is not expected to occur it will be ignored for hedging purposes, as is the requirement to fair value interest rate swaps.
Based on the 31March 2017 position a 33% appreciation largest annual change over the last ten years in the Euro relative to Sterling would result in a nil change 2015 16: nil in reported profits.
Assets Liabilities 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Euro denominated 11 10 11 10 Credit risk management The Groups approach to credit risk management of counterparties is referred to in the Financial policies and principles on pages 43 to 45 and the risks addressed within Managing risk in delivering Our strategy on pages 46 to 49.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Cash and short term deposits at 31 March 2017 amounted to 114m 2015 16: 114m.
Deposits and interest rate deposits were placed with financial institutions with BBB or better credit ratings.
At 31 March 2017, the fair value of all interest rate derivative assets was 217m 2015 16: 167m.
At 31 March 2017, prior to taking into account any offset arrangements, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits, liquid investments and derivatives was 120m 2015 16: 85m.
This represents 0.9% 2015 16: 0.6% of gross assets.
The deposit exposures are with UK banks and UK branches of international banks.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables is analysed in note 13.
Provisions are made taking account historic credit losses and the creditworthiness of debtors.
Liquidity risk management The Groups approach to liquidity risk management is discussed in the Financial policies and principles on pages 43 to 45, and the risks addressed within Managing risk in delivering Our strategy on pages 46 to 49.
The following table presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
For derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
Trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
134 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17 Net debt continued Liquidity risk management continued The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer term, debt refinancings.
The Group leases out all its investment properties under operating leases with a weighted average lease length of eight years.
This secure income profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates.
The future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases is also shown in the table below.
Income from joint ventures and funds is not included below.
Additional liquidity will arise from letting space in properties under construction as well as from distributions received from joint ventures and funds.
Any short term liquidity gap between the net payments required and the rentals receivable can be met through other liquidity sources available to the Group.
The Group currently holds cash and short term deposits of 114m of which 99m is not subject to a security interest see footnote 5 to net debt table on page 127.
Further liquidity can be achieved through sales of property assets or investments and debt refinancings.
The Groups property portfolio is valued externally at 9,520m and the share of joint ventures and funds property is valued at 4,801m.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to the Group are a further source of liquidity.
The maturity profile of committed undrawn borrowing facilities is shown overleaf.
