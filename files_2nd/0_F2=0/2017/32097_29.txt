In July 2015 an announcement was made meaning that the applicable tax rate in the UK will reduce from 20% to 19% for the fiscal year starting 1 April 2017 and thereafter.
This was substantively enacted on 1 April 2017 and therefore deferred tax balances arising in the UK have been revalued to 19%.
In March 2016 it was announced that for the fiscal year starting 1 April 2020 the rate would reduce to 17%.
This change has not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and deferred tax balances have therefore not been revalued to this rate.
The Spanish corporation tax rate reduced to 25% on 1 January 2016.
Based on the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, the tax disclosures reflect deferred tax measured at 19% in the UK and 25% in Spain.

Capital risk management THE ACCOUNTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while CONTINUED maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 20, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 23 to 25.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters as discussed in Notes 20 and 21.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis During the year, the Group has been exposed to movements in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling, where Sterling is the functional currency of the Group.
The following tables detail the Groups sensitivity to a 0.20 2016 0.15 increase and decrease in the Euro Sterling exchange rate.
A 0.20 2016 0.15 movement in the rate in either direction is managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates in the near term.
The sensitivity analysis includes only any outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 0.20 2016 0.15 change in foreign currency rates.

The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate liabilities and related derivatives.
For the floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared on the basis of both the average liability outstanding over the year and the average rate applicable for the year.
In all instances it is assumed that any derivatives designated in hedging relationships are 100% effective.
A 1.0% 2016 1.0% increase or decrease has been used in the analyses and represents managements best estimate of a reasonably possible change in interest rates in the near term.
As would be As would be stated if stated if As stated in 1.0% 1.0% annual report increase decrease 2017 000 000 000 Profit before taxation 72,222 72,002 72,443 Total equity 516,617 516,442 516,795 As would be As would be stated if stated if As stated in 1.0% 1.0% annual report increase decrease 2016 000 000 000 Profit before taxation 77,632 77,200 78,062 Total equity 471,025 470,680 471,370 Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and financial liabilities.
Included in Note 20 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
All interest cash flows and the weighted average effective interest rate have been calculated using interest rate conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.
