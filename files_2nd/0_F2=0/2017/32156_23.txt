FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies General information NewRiver REIT plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group is a property investment group specialising in commercial real estate in the UK.
Scheme of arrangement During the year, the Group completed its move from AIM to the premium listing segment of the official list, trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
NewRiver REIT plc became the ultimate parent company, with the former parent company, NewRiver Retail Limited, becoming a direct subsidiary of NewRiver REIT plc, in a scheme of arrangement on 18 August 2016.
The principal steps of the group reorganisation were as follows: NewRiver REIT plc was incorporated in the United Kingdom on 8 June 2016 under the Companies Act 2006 as a public company.
On incorporation, the share capital of NewRiver REIT plc was 50,000.02 divided into 2 ordinary shares of 1 pence and 50,000 redeemable preference shares of 1.
The preference shares were redeemed on 12 October 2016.
As part of a scheme of arrangement under Guernsey law, all issued ordinary shares in the capital of NewRiver Retail Limited, the former holding company of the Group, were cancelled by way of a reduction of capital on 18 August 2016.
Following the cancellation of the shares, NewRiver Retail Limited issued a corresponding number of ordinary shares to the Company, such that the Company held all of the issued shares in the capital of NewRiver Retail Limited.
The Company has, in turn, issued ordinary shares to the former shareholders of NewRiver Retail Limited on a one-for-one basis.
The result of the share cancellation and share issue is that the Company is now the ultimate parent company of the Group.
Throughout the period from incorporation to 18 August 2016, NewRiver REIT plc was a dormant company with no revenues and no assets and did not constitute a business as defined by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The transaction therefore falls outside the scope of that standard.
Following the guidance regarding the selection of an appropriate accounting policy provided by IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the transaction has been accounted for using the principles of merger accounting, allowed for group reconstructions, as set out in FRS 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
This policy, which does not conflict with IFRS, reflects the economic substance of the transaction as a continuation of the previous Group.
The comparatives presented in these consolidated financial statements are therefore the consolidated results and financial positon of NewRiver Retail Ltd for the year then ended.
In order to present equity as a continuation of the previous Group, share capital and reserves have been restated at the preceding reporting dates as follows: Share Merger Other Hedging Share option Revaluation Retained capital reserve reserves reserve reserve reserves earnings Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 1 April 2015 as previously reported 273,582 690 1,063 7,486 58,254 339,695 Presentation of reserves 273,582 1,063 7,486 282,131 Cancellation of shares in former parent company no par value Issue of new shares in new parent company 127,077,895 x 1p per share 1,271 1,271 1 April 2015 as currently reported 1,271 1,271 690 340,385 339,695 1 April 2016 as previously reported 554,599 1,842 1,961 16,901 118,248 689,867 Presentation of reserves 554,599 1,961 16,901 573,461 Cancellation of shares in former parent company no par value Issue of new shares in new parent company 233,393,712 x 1p per share 2,334 2,334 1 April 2016 as currently reported 2,334 2,334 1,842 691,709 689,867 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 119 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 119 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Going concern The Directors of NewRiver REIT plc have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group making reasonable assumptions about future trading and performance.
The key areas reviewed were: Value of investment property Timing of property transactions Capital expenditure and tenant incentives Rental income Loan covenants Capital and debt funding The Group has cash and short-term deposits, as well as profitable rental income streams and as a consequence the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks.
Whilst the Group has borrowing facilities in place, as detailed in note 19, the Group is currently within all financial covenants.
The Group has bank facilities to fund any future risk-controlled developments.
The Group has a significant portion of borrowings that fall due within one year of the balance sheet date.
The Directors are currently in advanced negotiations with the existing lenders and with some new lenders to agree facilities to refinance the existing borrowings.
The Directors are confident that these bank facilities can be refinanced, or in the absence of available bank finance that the properties could be sold at a value significantly above the associate borrowing.
After making enquiries and examining major areas which could give rise to significant financial exposure, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparation of these financial statements.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
Basis of preparation Statement of compliance These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union IFRS, therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and derivatives which are stated at fair value.
Cash flow statement The Group has reported the cash flows from operating activities using the indirect method.
Interest received is presented within investing cash flows: interest paid is presented within operating cash flows.
The acquisitions of investment properties are disclosed as cash flows from investing activities because this most appropriately reflects the Groups business activities.
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries controlled by the Company, made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intra group transactions are eliminated in full.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosure In the current year, the following new and amended IFRSs and amendments have been adopted but have not had a material effect on the financial performance or position of the Group: IAS 1 Amendments Disclosure Initiative IAS 16 and IAS 38 Amendments Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation IAS 27 Amendments Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements IFRS 11 Amendments Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Amendments Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 Cycle NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 120 120 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective: IAS 7 Amendments Disclosure Initiative IAS 12 Amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses IAS 40 Amendments Transfers of Investment Property IFRS 2 Amendments Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions IFRS 4 Amendments Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 may impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments, IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures and IFRS 16 may impact the recognition and measurement of leases on the Groups balance sheet.
Business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of completion, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquired.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition.
Where the fair value of the consideration is less than the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities then the difference is recognised as a bargain purchase in the income statement.
Each acquisition is considered by management in light of the substance of the acquisition to determine whether the acquisition is a business combination or acquisition of investment property.
Joint ventures Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control with a partner.
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment.
In assessing whether a particular entity is controlled, the Group considers all of the contractual terms of the arrangement, whether it has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the joint venture so as to obtain benefits from its activities, and the existence of any legal disputes or challenges to this control in order to conclude whether the Group controls the joint venture.
Investment property Property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, is classified as investment property.
Investment property comprises both freehold and leasehold land and buildings.
Investment property is recognised as an asset when: It is probable that the future economic benefits that are associated with the investment property will flow to the Company: There are no material conditions precedent which could prevent completion: and The cost of the investment property can be measured reliably.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
When the Group begins to redevelop an investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property remains an investment property.
Investment property is derecognised when the risk and rewards of the property is transferred to the purchaser.
Gains or losses on the sale of properties are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 121 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 121 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised over the useful lives of the equipment, using the straight-line method at a rate of between 10% to 25% depending on the useful life.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset.
Operating leases As lessor The cost of securing an operating lease are capitalised within the carrying amount of the related investment property and amortised over the lease term.
Revenue from operating leases is recognised as per the revenue recognition policy.
As lessee Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another party, the lessor, are classified as operating leases.
Payments including prepayments, made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less which are readily accessible.
Financial instruments Financial assets Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or loans and receivables as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets are recognised upon becoming party to the contractual terms and are initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The fair value of a non-interest bearing asset is its discounted receivable amount.
If the due date of the asset is less than one year, discounting is omitted.
The Groups financial assets consist of cash, loans and receivables and derivative instruments.
The financial instruments classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include interest rate swap and cap arrangements.
Recognition of the derivative financial instruments takes place when the hedging contracts are entered into.
They are recognised at fair value and transaction costs are included directly in finance costs.
The fair values of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Interest rate swaps and caps are measured using the midpoint of the yield curve prevailing on the reporting date.
The valuations do not include accrued interest from the previous settlement date to the reporting date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the contracted rate and the valuation rate when applied to the projected balances for the period from the reporting date to the contracted expiry dates.
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Group assesses at each financial position date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
If there is objective evidence such as significant financial difficulty of the obligor, breach of contract, or it becomes probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, the asset is tested for impairment.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows that is the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are carried at amortised cost less a provision for impairment where there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreased and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised costs at the reversal date.
NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 122 122 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss or as other liabilities.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
All loans and borrowings are classified as other liabilities.
Initial recognition is at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities included in trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The fair value of a non-interest bearing liability is its discounted repayment amount.
If the due date of the liability is less than one year, discounting is omitted.
Hedge accounting Hedges of interest rate risk on firm commitments are designated as cash flow hedges where the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Share capital Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.
The cost of issuing share capital is recognised directly in equity against the proceeds from the share capital.
Taxation Income tax The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the balance sheet.
Tax is recognised in the income statement.
Deferred tax Any deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax except: Where the value added tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the value added tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of value added tax included.
The net amount of value added tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Share-based payments The cost of equity settled transactions is measured with reference to the fair value at the date at which they were granted.
Where vesting performance conditions are non-market based, the fair value excludes the effect these vesting conditions and an estimate is made at each balance sheet date of the number of instruments expected to vest.
The fair value is recognised over the vesting period in the income statement, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Any change to the number of instruments with non-market vesting conditions expected to vest is recognised in the income statement for that period.
NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 123 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 123 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Employee Benefit Trust The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust for the exclusive benefit of the Groups employees.
The investment in the Companys shares held by the trust is recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the shares held by the trust.
Revenue recognition Rental income Rental income from fixed and minimum guaranteed rent reviews is recognised on a straight-line basis over the entire lease term.
Where such rental income is recognised ahead of the related cash flow, an adjustment is made to ensure the carrying value of the related property including the accrued rent does not exceed the external valuation.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging a new lease are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period from the date of lease commencement to the expiry date of the lease.
Where a rent-free period is included in a lease, the rental income foregone is allocated evenly over the period from the date of lease commencement to the expiry date of the lease.
Where a lease incentive payment, or surrender premiums is paid to enhance the value of a property, it is amortised on a straight-line basis over the period from the date of lease commencement to the expiry date of the lease.
It is managements policy to recognise all material lease incentives and lease incentives greater than six months.
Upon receipt of a surrender premium for the early determination of a lease, the profit, net of dilapidations and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the lease concerned, is immediately reflected in income.
Asset management fees Management fees are recognised in the income statement as the services are delivered.
Promote payments The Group is contractually entitled to receive a promote payment should the returns from a joint venture to the joint venture partner exceed a certain internal rate of return.
This payment is only receivable by the Group on disposal of underlying properties held by the joint venture or other termination events.
Any entitlements under these arrangements are only accrued for in the financial statements once the Group believes that crystallisation of the fee is virtually certain.
Dividends Dividends to the Companys shareholders are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends, this is when paid.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by equity holders.
Finance income and costs Finance income and costs are recognised using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts throughout the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
Service charge income and expense Service charge income is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered and the related property expenses are recognised in the period in which they are incurred.
Exceptional items Performance measures are adjusted to exclude exceptional items.
Exceptional items are items that are significant in size or nature, or are non-recurring and are adjusted to explain the performance of the Group.
In the current and comparative year exceptional items consist of the Groups expenses in relation to the move from AIM to the Main Market.
NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 124 124 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, of revenues and expenses, and of gains and losses.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience as adjusted for current market conditions and other factors.
Significant judgements Investment properties The Groups investment properties are stated at fair value, based on an independent external appraisal.
The valuation of the Groups development property portfolio and its joint ventures is inherently subjective due to, amongst other factors, the individual nature of each property, forecast trading EBITDA, the status of planning consent, the assumption that vacant possession will be obtained, development cost projections, tenant credit risk and the expected future rental income.
As a result, the valuation of the Groups development property portfolio is subject to a degree of uncertainty and is based on information available at the date of valuation.
Taxation The Company has elected for REIT status.
To continue to qualify from the regime, the Group is required to comply with certain conditions as defined in the REIT legislation.
Management are required to exercise judgement to determine whether each property acquisition should be included within the REIT rental property income business and whether, on disposal of that property, any gain arising is capital or trading in nature and therefore whether it has triggered a tax charge to be payable to HMRC.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2017 as detailed in note 9.
Judgement is required in assessing the likelihood that taxable income will be available to utilise the losses.
Accounting for acquisitions Management must assess whether the acquisition of property through the purchase of a corporate vehicle should be accounted for as an asset purchase or a business combination.
Management exercise judgement to determine whether the acquired business or property contains processes and inputs in addition to property.
When management conclude that processes and inputs are being acquired in addition to the property then the transaction is accounted for as a business combination.
Where there are no such items, the transaction is treated as an asset purchase.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill and reviewed annually for impairment.
Any discount received or acquisition related costs are recognised in the income statement.
Sources of estimation uncertainty As noted above, the Groups investment properties are stated at fair value.
The assumptions and estimates used to value the properties are detailed in note 12.
Small changes in the key estimates, such as the estimated future rental income, can have a significant impact on the valuation of the investment properties, and therefore a significant impact on the balance sheet and key performances measures such as Net Asset Value per share.
Certain estimates require an assessment of factors not within managements control, such as overall market conditions.
Rents and ERVs have a direct relationship to valuation, while yield has an inverse relationship.
Estimated costs of a development project will inversely affect the valuation of development properties.
There are interrelationships between all these unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase in more than one unobservable input could be to magnify the impact on the valuation.
The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two unobservable inputs moving in directions which have an opposite impact on value e. g. an increase in rent may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation.
The estimated fair value may differ from the price at which the Groups assets could be sold.
Actual realisation of net assets could differ from the valuation used in these financial statements, and the difference could be significant.
NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 Segmental reporting The chief operating decision maker is the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors are of the opinion that the principal activity of the Group is to invest in commercial real estate in the UK.
IFRS requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal financial reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker i. e. the Board of Directors.
The internal financial reports received by the Board contain financial information at a Group level and there are no reconciling items between the results contained in these reports and the amounts reported in the financial statements.
The property portfolio includes investment properties located throughout the UK, predominantly regional investments outside London and comprises a diverse portfolio of commercial buildings including shopping centres, retail warehouses, high street assets and pubs.
The Directors consider that these properties all contribute to delivering on a strategy of targeting higher-yielding property that offer attractive returns through rental income.
Therefore, these individual properties have been aggregated into a single operating segment.
All of the Groups properties are based in the UK.
No geographical grouping is contained in any of the internal financial reports provided to the Board and, therefore, no geographical segmental analysis is disclosed.

The principal reasons for the increase is presentation of costs in relation to the pub portfolio and the acquisition of a property in London with a significant ground rent.
An element of the pub portfolio is transitioning from receiving a net rent to a leased model whereby the Group receives gross income and pays operating expenses.

The losses have not been recognised as an asset due to uncertainty over the availability of taxable income to utilise the losses.
The losses do not expire but are reliant on continuity of ownership and source of trade.
NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 128 128 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Real Estate Investment Trust regime REIT regime The Group is a member of the REIT regime whereby profits from its UK property rental business are tax exempt.
The REIT regime only applies to certain property-related profits and has several criteria which have to be met.
The main criteria are: the assets of the property rental business must be at least 75% of the Groups assets: the profit from the tax-exempt property rental business must exceed 75% of the Groups total profit at least 90% of the Groups profit from the property rental business must be paid as dividends.
The Group continues to meet these conditions and management intends that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future.
10 Performance measures The Groups key performance measure is Funds from Operations or FFO.
This performance measure is intended to measure the underlying profitability of the Group and as such includes realised gains on disposals and adds back expense recognised for noncash share-based payment, unrealised gains and the one-off cost in respect of the costs of the move to the main market.
The measure is not intended to replace the cash measures disclosed in the cash flow statement.
The Group has previously referred to this measure as EPRA Adjusted earnings.
The Group no longer discloses NAREIT FFO as a performance measure.

The valuations are performed by appropriately qualified valuers who have relevant and recent experience in the sector.
The fair value at 2017 represents the highest and best use.
The properties are categorised as Level 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers of property between Levels 1, 2 and 3.
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The valuation was determined using an income capitalisation method, which involves applying a yield to rental income streams.
Inputs include yield, current rent and ERV.
Development properties are valued using a residual method, which involves valuing the completed investment property using an investment method and deducting estimated costs to complete, then applying an appropriate discount rate.
The relationship of unobservable inputs to fair value are the higher the rental values and the lower the yield, the higher the fair value.
In respect of the pub portfolio the valuer makes judgements on whether to use residual value or a higher value to include development potential where appropriate.
Where no conversion opportunity has been identified at present, the valuer has not specifically considered an alternative use valuation.
NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 131 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 131 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 12 Investment properties continued These inputs include: Rental value total rental value per annum Equivalent yield the discount rate of the perpetual cash flow to produce a net present value of zero assuming a purchase at the valuation EBITDA multiples and maintainable earnings from each pub There were no changes to valuation techniques during the year.
Valuation reports are based on both information provided by the Group, e. g. current rents and lease terms which is derived from the Companys financial and property management systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment, and assumptions applied by the valuer, e. g. ERVs and yields.
These assumptions are based on market observation and the valuers professional judgement.
Revenues are derived from a large number of tenants with no single tenant or group under common control contributing more than 4% of the Groups revenue.
The effect of an increase in more than one unobservable input would be to magnify the impact on the valuation.
The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two unobservable inputs moving in opposite directions, e. g. an increase in rent may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation.
Expected vacancy rates may impact the yield with higher vacancy rates resulting in higher yields.

Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at floating interest rates see note 19.
The Groups interest rate risk is reviewed quarterly by the Board.
The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings through the use of interest rate derivatives see note 16.
Interest rate caps and interest rate swaps are used to both mitigate the risk of an increase in interest rates but also to allow the Group to benefit from a fall in interest rates.
51% of the Groups interest rate exposure is fixed and the remainder is capped.
The Group has employed an external adviser when contracting hedging to advise on the structure of the hedging.
Sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the impact of an increase in interest rates on finance costs to the Group.
Management consider that a significant movement in interest rates would by 200 bps and have therefore carried out sensitivity analysis of the impact of such a movement.
The impact of a 200 bps increase in interest rates for the year would increase the net interest payable in the income statement and reduce net assets by 6.2 million March 2016: 0.6 million.
The impact of a 200 bps decrease in interest rates for the year would reduce the net interest payable in the income statement and increase net assets by 7.7 million March 2016: 0.7 million.
The directors consider this to be a reasonable sensitivity given historic interest rates and the possibility for short term swings in rates.

These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires the Directors to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
Changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the financial statements in the period the assumptions changed.
The Directors believe that the underlying assumptions are appropriate.
The most critical estimates, assumptions and judgements relate to the determination of carrying value of the investment in the Companys subsidiary undertaking.
The nature, facts and circumstance of the investment are taken into account on assessing whether there are any indications of impairment.
Disclosure exemptions The Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions allowed by FRS 101.
These financial statements do not include: certain disclosures regarding the Companys capital: a statement of cash flows: certain disclosures in respect of financial instruments: the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted: and disclosure of related party transactions with wholly-owned members of the Group.
The above disclosure exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated Group accounts into which the Company is consolidated.
