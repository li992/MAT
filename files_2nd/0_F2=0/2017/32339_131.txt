Property, plant and equipment What critical estimates have we made for property plant and equipment?
The plant and equipment in our networks is long-lived with cables and switching equipment operating for over ten years and underground ducts being used for decades.
We also develop software for use in IT systems and platforms that support the products and services provided to our customers.
Our annual depreciation and amortisation charge is sensitive to the estimated service life we allocate to each type of asset.
If an asset life is extended this would reduce the annual depreciation or amortisation charge: reducing a life would increase the charge.
Asset lives are assessed annually and changed when necessary to reflect our current thinking on technological change, network investment plans including the groups fibre rollout programme, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets concerned.
Changes to the service lives of assets implemented in the year had no significant impact on our results for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The carrying values of software, property, plant and equipment are disclosed below and in note 12.
The useful lives applied to the principal categories of assets are disclosed on pages 178 and 179.
