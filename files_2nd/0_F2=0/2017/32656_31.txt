Segmental Analysis IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the Groups segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Executive Chairman of JD Sports Fashion Plc.
Information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker is focused on the nature of the businesses within the Group.
The Groups operating and reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: Sports Fashion includes the results of JD Sports Fashion Plc, John David Sports Fashion Ireland Limited, Spodis SA, Champion Sports Ireland, JD Sprinter Holdings 2010 SL including subsidiary companies, JD Sports Fashion BV, Sports Unlimited Retail BV, JD Sports Fashion Germany GmbH, JD Sports Fashion SRL, JD Sports Fashion Belgium BVBA, JD Sports Fashion Sweden AB, JD Sports Fashion Denmark ApS, JD Sports Fashion SDN BHD, JD Sports Fashion Holdings Aus Pty including subsidiary companies, Size GmbH, ActivInstinct Limited, JD Gyms Limited, Duffer of St George Limited, Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Kooga Rugby Limited, Focus Brands Limited including subsidiary companies, Kukri Sports Limited including global subsidiary companies, Source Lab Limited, R.

co. uk Limited, Ark Fashion Limited, 2Squared Agency Limited, 2Squared Retail Limited and Mainline Menswear Limited.
Outdoor includes the results of Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited, Tiso Group Limited including subsidiary companies and Go Outdoors Topco Limited including subsidiary companies.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker receives and reviews segmental operating profit.
Certain central administrative costs including Group Directors salaries are included within the Groups core Sports Fashion result.
This is consistent with the results as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
IFRS 8 requires disclosure of information regarding revenue from major products and customers.
The majority of the Groups revenue is derived from the retail of a wide range of apparel, footwear and accessories to the general public.
As such, the disclosure of revenues from major customers is not appropriate.
Disclosure of revenue from major product groups is not provided at this time due to the cost involved to develop a reliable product split on a same category basis across all companies in the Group.
Intersegment transactions are undertaken in the ordinary course of business on arms length terms.
The Board consider that certain items are cross divisional in nature and cannot be allocated between the segments on a meaningful basis.
Net funding costs and taxation are treated as unallocated reflecting the nature of the Groups syndicated borrowing facilities and its tax group.
Drawdowns from the Groups syndicated borrowing facility of nil 2016: nil, a deferred tax liability of 8,192,000 2016: asset of 482,000 and an income tax liability of 33,648,000 2016: 15,757,000 are included within the unallocated segment.
Each segment is shown net of intercompany transactions and balances within that segment.
The eliminations remove intercompany transactions and balances between different segments which primarily relate to the net down of long term loans and short term working capital funding provided by JD Sports Fashion Plc within Sports Fashion to other companies in the Group, and intercompany trading between companies in different segments.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.
In the case of goods sold through the retail stores and trading websites, revenue is recognised when goods are sold and the title has passed, less provision for returns.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of the sale and this provision is included within accruals.
Retail sales are usually in cash, by debit card or by credit card.
Wholesale revenue is recognised when goods are dispatched and the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer.
In some instances, goods are sold with a right of return.
Where wholesale goods are sold with a right of return, a provision is made to estimate the expected level of returns based on accumulated experience and historical rates.
The provision for returns is included within accruals.
Wholesale sales are either settled by cash received in advance of the goods being dispatched or made on agreed credit terms.
