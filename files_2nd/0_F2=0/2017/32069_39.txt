NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 30 April 2017 17.
During the period the Group disposed of the Dunlop brand, see note 32.
120 Sports Direct International plc Annual Report 2017 The carrying value of goodwill and brands that are considered to have an indefinite life are allocated to the Groups operating segments before aggregation.
With the exception of Everlast, none of the individual cash-generating units CGUs are considered material to goodwill or indefinite life intangibles Brands.
The carrying value of goodwill and brands allocated to the Groups CGUs, as aggregated except in the case of Everlast, is shown below: 30 April 2017 24 April 2016 m m Goodwill Brands Goodwill Brands m m m m International Sports Retail 7.7 - 3.1 - Lifestyle & other - - 9.0 - Brands excl.
Everlast 25.8 2.4 48.9 6.4 Everlast 54.4 86.2 54.4 74.8 87.9 88.6 115.4 81.2 The Group tests the carrying amount of goodwill and assets with an indefinite life annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that their carrying value might be impaired.
The carrying amounts of other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication of impairment.
Impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amounts to the value in use derived from discounted cash flow projections for each CGU to which the intangible assets are allocated.
A CGU is deemed to be an individual fascia or brand and these have been grouped together into similar classes for the purpose of formulating operating segments as reported in note 4.
The recoverable amount of CGUs was 392m.
Value in use calculations are based on five year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long-term growth rate of the sector served by the CGUs.
The key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each CGU, in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives as at 30 April 2017 were as follows: UK Sports International Brands excl.
Everlast Retail Retail Everlast Sales growth 0%-5% 0%-5% 0%-2% 0%-5% Terminal sales growth 2 % 2 % 0% 2% Gross margin 35%-50% 35%-50% 30%-40% 20%-30% Capital expenditure Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Discount rates 6.3% 6.3% 6.3% 11.0% The pre-tax Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital is used in Sports Retail, Premium Lifestyle and Brands excl.
Everlast as these CGUs are considered to have similar risk profiles.
The pre-tax WACC is used as the discount rate.
The key assumptions are based on managements historical experience and future plans for each CGU.
A reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the grounds of the proven longevity of the brands and trading names and the Groups commitment to maintaining those brands.
All key assumptions are consistent with known external sources of information.
