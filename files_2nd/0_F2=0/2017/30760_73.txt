Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future taxable profits will be available.
Where this is the case, the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised gross tax losses excluding capital losses and other temporary differences of 787 million 2016: 796 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.
Of these, trading losses of 92 million will expire within the next 20 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised gross capital losses of 443 million 2016: 503 million.
These have no expiry date.
There are no temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
