information about the Group and the accounting policies that apply to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
Accounting policies that are specific to a particular note are provided within the note to which it relates.
This section also details the new or amended accounting standards adopted during the year as well as the anticipated impact of future changes to accounting standards that are not yet effective.
UBM plc is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey under the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
The registered office is Ogier House, The Esplanade, St. Helier, JE4 9WG, Jersey.
UBM plc is tax resident in the United Kingdom.
The principal activities of the Group are described in Section 2.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2018.
They are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and are prepared under the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and hedged items which are measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company, UBM plc.
All amounts are rounded to the nearest 0.1m unless otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used for the previous financial year, except for the adoption of the following new and amended IFRSs.
The following new and amended standards have been adopted but they do not impact the consolidated financial statements of the Group: Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Asset Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture: and Annual Improvements 2014-2016 IFRS 12: Disclosure of interests in other entities: IFRS 1: First-time adoption of IFRS IAS 28: Investments in associates and joint ventures Discontinued operations The disposed PR Newswire business was a discontinued operation during 2016.
In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group has recognised an additional 7.8m gain on disposal of PR Newswire primarily due to the release of warranties and indemnities which were originally recognised in accordance with specific clauses in the sale agreement.
This gain has been recognised as an exceptional item for discontinued operations in the year ended 31 December 2017.
The gain has a 2.0 pence impact on basic and diluted earnings per share and no cash flow effect.
Comparative information The comparative information in the consolidated statement of financial position for the year ended 31 December 2016 has been restated for acquisition accounting adjustments in relation to the Allworld Exhibitions acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008.
The impact of the restatement of the 31 December 2016 values is to increase intangible assets, property plant and equipment, provisions and deferred tax liability by 23.0m, 0.2m, 0.5m and 2.4m respectively with a corresponding decrease in goodwill, trade and other receivables, deferred tax asset, trade and other payables and current tax liability of 20.9m, 0.8m, 0.4m, 0.8m and 1.0m respectively.
Refer to Note 6.1 for further details.
Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future see page 45 of the Operating and Financial Review.
The consolidated financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise those of UBM plc the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it has the rights to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.
The financial statements of material subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 105 Section 1: Basis of preparation continued Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are joint arrangements in which the Group has the rights to the net assets through joint control with a third party.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence through the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures and associates using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in the joint venture or associate is initially measured at cost.
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Groups share of net assets of the entity since the acquisition date.
Goodwill relating to the entity is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The income statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of the entity.
The statement of comprehensive income includes the Groups share of any other comprehensive income recognised by the joint venture or associate.
All unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions with joint ventures and associates are eliminated in full.
These investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the payment is established.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by Group entities in their respective functional currency using the spot rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date.
Differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing in the month in which the transactions occurred.
The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in other comprehensive income and are shown as a separate component of equity, which was reset to zero on first time adoption of IFRS.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items designated as a hedge of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation are also recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the accumulated amount of other comprehensive income held in a separate component of equity relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss, along with the cumulative amount of exchange recognised in relation to hedging instruments.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures.
Uncertainty about the assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes which differ from the estimates.
The judgements made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies that have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements relate to: Unrecognised deferred tax assets Note 3.6 The identification of cash generating units and assumptions used in the impairment testing of goodwill Note 4.1 The measurement of retirement benefit obligations Note 7.2 The identification of intangible assets acquired in business combinations Note 6.1 The key areas of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that could have a material effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year relate to: Current tax liabilities Note 3.6 Forecast cash flows used in annual impairment testing of goodwill Note 4.1 Provisions, including warranty provisions Note 4.6 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 106
