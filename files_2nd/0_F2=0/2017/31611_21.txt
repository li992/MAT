The principal variations from the historical cost convention Revenue recognition relate to derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The financial statements of the Group Approximately 40% of the Companys revenue is generated from sales to partners rather than to end users.
The key judgement in accounting comprise the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries prepared at the end of the for the three principal ways in which our business partners are remunerated is determining whether the business partner is a customer of the reporting period.
The Company controls an entity when it is Group in respect of the initial product sale.
The key criteria in this determination is whether the business partner has paid for and taken on the exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power risks and rewards of ownership of the software product from Sage.
At this point the business partner is able to sell on the licence to the end over the entity, which is usually from date of acquisition.

The prior year consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of cash flows and their related notes have been restated for the Where the business partner is a customer of Sage, there are two ways in which they can be remunerated.
Firstly, there are discounts granted as presentation of discontinued operations.

Secondly, there are further discounts given to business partners for New or amended accounting standards.

These discounts are recognised as a deduction from the incremental revenue earned.
There are no IFRS, IAS amendments or IFRIC interpretations effective for the first time this financial year that have had a material impact Where the business partner is not a customer of Sage and their part in the sale has simply been in the form of a referral, they are remunerated on the Group.
in the form of a commission payment.
These payments are treated as a cost within selling and administrative costs.
Going concern An additional area of judgement is the recognition and deferral of revenue on bundled products, for example the sale of a perpetual licence The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the with an annual maintenance and support contract.
When products are bundled together for the purpose of sale, the associated revenue, net of Strategic report on pages 1 to 61. all applicable discounts, is allocated between the constituent parts of the bundle on a relative fair value basis.
The Group has a systematic basis for allocating relative fair values in these situations, based upon published list prices.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern Goodwill impairment basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies There are two key judgement areas in relation to goodwill impairment.
The first is the ongoing appropriateness of the cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
In the current year CGUs Foreign currencies were assessed in the context of the Groups evolving business model, the Sage strategy and the shift to global product development.

The other key judgement area relates to the assumptions applied in calculating the value in use of the CGUs being tested for impairment.

Issues can take many years to resolve and assumptions on the likely outcome have therefore been made by management.
The nature of the assumptions made by management when calculating the carrying amounts relates to the estimated tax which could be payable as a result of decisions with tax authorities in respect of transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
In making the estimates, managements judgement was based on various factors, including: the status of recent and current tax audits and enquiries: the results of previous claims: and any changes to the relevant tax environments.

The amount by which the consideration exceeds the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
The application of accounting policies to business combinations involves judgement and the use of estimates.
During the year, the Group made two significant business combinations in which it acquired Sage Intacct formerly Intacct Corporation and Sage People formerly Fairsail Limited.
The aspects of these transactions that required particular judgement were the identification of acquired intangible assets that met the criteria for recognition in both transactions.
Estimates were required in the measurement of the intangible assets recognised for both acquisitions and of deferred income for Sage Intacct.
The Group engaged external experts to support these assessments.
Management concluded that the intangible assets acquired that qualified for recognition separately from goodwill were customer relationships, technology and, additionally for Intacct, brands.
The fair values of customer relationships were determined using the excess earnings method, technology and brands using the relief from royalty method, and deferred income using a bottom-up approach.
These valuation techniques require a number of key assumptions including revenue forecasts and the application of an appropriate discount rate to state future cash flows at their present value.
The total fair value of intangible assets excluding goodwill acquired with Intacct and Sage People was 179m.
Deferred income acquired with Intacct was measured at 18m.
Full analyses of the consideration transferred, assets and liabilities acquired and goodwill recognised in business combinations are set out in note 16.
The note also includes an explanation of the accounting policy applied.
Amounts recognised for Intacct at 30 September 2017 are provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the date of approval of the Annual Report, and will be finalised during the coming year.
Future accounting standards The Directors also considered the impact on the Group of new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments.
The following revised and new accounting standards may have a material impact on the Group.
They are currently issued but not effective for the Group for the year ended 30 September 2017: IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: and IFRS 16, Leases.
IFRS 9 will be effective for the Group starting 1 October 2018 and will replace the current requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The main changes introduced by the new standard are new classification and measurement requirements for certain financial assets, a new expected loss model for the impairment of financial assets, revisions to the hedge accounting model and amendments to disclosures.
The changes are generally to be applied retrospectively.
IFRS 15 will be effective for the Group starting 1 October 2018.
The standard permits a choice of two possible transition methods for the initial application of the requirements of the new standard: 1 retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, or 2 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised on the date of initial application, being 1 October 2018 for the Group the cumulative catch-up approach.
The Group currently has not selected the transition method for applying the new standard.
The Group is in the process of developing its future IFRS 15 revenue recognition policies and adjusting the relevant business processes to adopt these new policies.
A project has been established across Sages main markets.
This project covers the development of new revenue recognition policies as well as the identification of aspects of processes, data requirements and systems that need to be addressed in order to apply IFRS 15.

To arrive at underlying results, certain adjustments are made for items that are individually important and which could, if included, distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Recurring items These are items which occur regularly but which management judge to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group.
These items relate mainly to fair value adjustments on financial instruments and merger and acquisition M&A related activity, although other types of recurring items may arise.
M&A activity by its nature is irregular in its impact and includes amortisation, adjustments to acquired deferred income and acquisition and disposal-related costs, including integration costs relating to an acquired business and acquisition-related remuneration.
Foreign currency movements on intercompany balances that are charged through the income statement are excluded from underlying so that exchange rate impacts do not distort comparisons.
Recurring items are adjusted each year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Non-recurring items These are items which are non-recurring and are adjusted on the basis of either their size or their nature.
These items can include, but are not restricted to, gains and losses on the disposal of assets, impairment charges and reversals, and  costs.
As these items are one-off or non-operational in nature, management considers that they would distort the Groups underlying business performance.

Current tax expense represents the amount payable on this years taxable profits and any adjustments relating to prior years.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
This note outlines the tax accounting policies, analyses the current and deferred tax expenses in the year and presents a reconciliation between profit before tax in the income statement multiplied by the UK rate of corporation tax and the tax expense for the year.
Accounting policy The taxation expense for the year represents the sum of current tax payable and deferred tax.
The expense is recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Current tax payable or receivable is based on the taxable income for the period and any adjustment in respect of prior periods.
Current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases note 12.

These assets include items such as goodwill, and other intangible assets such as brands, customer relationships, computer software, in-process R&D and technology which have predominantly been acquired as part of business combinations.
These assets are initially measured at fair value, which is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of that business at the acquisition date.
This section also explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the Directors in arriving at the carrying value of these assets.
6.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups total identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1 October 1998 has not been reinstated and is not recycled to the income statement on the disposal of the business to which it relates.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates.
When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the allocation represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.

This is the level at which goodwill is monitored.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the allocation represents the lowest level Annual goodwill impairment tests at which goodwill is monitored.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
In determining value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
The Group performed its annual test for impairment on 30 June 2017.
In all cases, the 2018 budget and the approved Group plan for the three years following the current financial year form the basis 2017 2016 for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
Beyond the three-year plan these projections are extrapolated using an estimated long-term Note m m growth rate.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the average medium-term revenue growth rates and the long-term Cost at 1 October 1,773 1,526 growth rates of net operating cash flows.

Discount rate The Group uses a discount rate based on a local Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for each CGU, applying local government yield bonds and tax rates to each CGU on a geographical basis.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a post-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the Q3 2017 and the risks specific to the CGU.
The post-tax discount rates applied to CGUs were in the range of 6.91% 2016: 6.96% to 15.34% 2016: 14.67%, reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the significant CGUs and management concluded that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Impairment charge The Group performed its annual test for impairment on 30 June 2017.
The recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value for each CGU.
Sage Intacct Subsequent to the annual impairment test on 30 June 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Intacct Corporation resulting in significant goodwill of 516m on 30 September 2017.
Management assessed whether there would be any triggering event or indicator that could lead to an impairment of the goodwill acquired through the Intacct Corporation acquisition and concluded that there were no indicators that the fair value of Sage Intacct is lower than the amount paid by Sage.

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control of those policies.
The Group determines whether it has significant influence based on the voting and any other rights it holds as a result of its investment and also any contractual arrangements in place.
Normally, if the Group holds over 20% of the voting rights of an entity without having control or joint control of that entity, the investment will be treated as an associate unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case.
Accounting policy The Groups investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment is initially measured at cost.
Subsequently, the carrying amount is adjusted to recognise changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date.
Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.
The income statement reflects the Groups share of the associates profit or loss after tax and any noncontrolling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate.
Any change in the Groups share of the associates other comprehensive income is presented as part of the Groups other comprehensive income.
In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any such changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity.
Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
The aggregate of the Groups share of profit or loss of the associate is shown on the face of the income statement outside operating profit.
The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment.
At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired.
If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss in the income statement.
At 30 September 2017, the Group had no investments in associates.
At 30 September 2016, the Groups investment in an associate comprised 100% of the C Ordinary Shares of Fairsail Limited Fairsail.

The majority of the Groups employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
Additionally, the Group operates two small defined benefit schemes in France and Switzerland.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions into separate funds on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to employees.
The risks associated with this type of plan are assumed by the member.
Contributions paid by the Group in respect of the current period are included within the income statement.
The defined benefit scheme is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules, salary and length of pensionable service.
The income statement charge for the defined benefit scheme is the current past service cost and the net interest cost which is the change in the net defined benefit liability that arises from the passage of time.
The Group underwrites both financial and demographic risks associated with this type of plan.
Accounting policy Obligations under defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
The Group also operates a small defined benefit pension scheme in Switzerland and other post-employment benefit schemes in France.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the assets of the Group.
Under French legislation, the Group is required to make one-off payments to employees in France who reach retirement age while still in employment.
The costs of providing benefits under these schemes are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Past service costs should be recognised on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment and the date the Group recognises  costs.
Interest on the pension plan assets and the imputed interest on pension plan liabilities are included within selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Changes in the post-employment benefit obligation due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they arise.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation and future administration costs at the end of the reporting period, less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximate to the terms of the related pension liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation of a defined benefit plan requires estimation of future events, for example salary and pension increases, inflation and mortality rates.
In the event that future experience does not bear out the estimates made in previous years, an adjustment will be made to the plans defined benefit obligation in future periods which could have a material effect on the Group.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the significant assumptions.
The significant assumptions are deemed to be the discount rate and salary increases, as these are most likely to have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations.
The analysis has been performed by the independent actuaries.

In this note we outline the accounting policies, movements in the year on the deferred tax account and the net deferred tax asset or liability at the year end.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction that is expected to arise in a future period.
A deferred tax liability represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result of a current or an earlier transaction.
Accounting policy Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be low, as the Board-approved Group treasury policy limits the value that can be invested with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The Group policy is to place cash and cash equivalents with counterparties which are well established banks with high credit ratings where available.
In some jurisdictions there is limited availability of such counterparties.

Accounting policy Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or when the Group has transferred those rights and either has also transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but no longer has control of the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
14.1 Fair values of financial instruments The carrying amounts of the following financial assets and liabilities approximate to their fair values: trade and other payables excluding tax and social security, trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and accrued income, short-term bank deposits and cash at bank and in hand.
The fair value of borrowings differs from their carrying amounts due to their bearing interest at fixed rates which are currently higher than floating rates.

The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation which is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
On disposal of the net investment, the foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instrument are recycled to the income statement from equity.
The fair values of the Groups external US Dollar and Euro-denominated borrowings designated as a hedge at 30 September 2017 were USD 562m and EUR 128m 2016: USD 650m and EUR 85m.
These borrowings were used to hedge the Groups exposure to the USD and EUR foreign exchange risk on its investments in subsidiaries in the US and Eurozone.

Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while optimising returns to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it with respect to changes in economic conditions and our strategic objectives.
The Group has set a long-term minimum leverage target of 1x net debt to EBITDA and will work to maintain this going forward.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing cash resources required to meet business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
The Company has committed facilities which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital.
The Treasury function has responsibility for optimising the level of cash across the business.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily arises from trade and other receivables.
The Group has a very low operational credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of operational credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
All counterparties must meet minimum credit rating requirements.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on floating rate deposits and borrowings.
The Group's borrowings comprise principally US private placement loan notes which are at fixed interest rates, and the bank revolving credit facility, which is subject to floating interest rates.
At 30 September 2017, the Group had 231m 2016: 264m of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group regularly reviews forecast debt, cash and cash equivalents and interest rates to monitor this risk.
Interest rates on debt and deposits are fixed when management decides this is appropriate.
At 30 September 2017, the Groups borrowings comprised US private placement loan notes of 522m 2016: 574m, which have an average fixed interest rate of 3.26% 2016: 3.40% : and unsecured bank loans of 429m 2016: nil, comprising mainly the bank revolving credit facility, which have an average fixed interest rate of 1.5%.
Foreign currency risk Although a substantial proportion of the Groups revenue and profit is earned outside the UK, operating companies generally only trade in their own currency.
The Group is therefore not subject to any significant foreign exchange transactional exposure within these subsidiaries.
The Groups principal exposure to foreign currency lies in the translation of overseas profits into sterling: this exposure is not hedged.
The Groups external Euro denominated borrowings and a proportion of its US Dollar borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US and Eurozone.
The foreign exchange movements on translation of the borrowings into sterling have therefore been recognised in the translation reserve.
Certain of the Groups intercompany balances have been identified as part of the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
Foreign exchange effects on these balances that remain on consolidation are also reflected in the translation reserve.
The Groups other currency exposures comprise those currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement, reflecting other monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity involved.
At 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2016, these exposures were immaterial to the Group.

Under the Performance Share Plan 3,198,162 2016: 3,410,056 awards were made during the year.
Awards prior to 2016 These performance shares are subject to a service condition and three performance conditions.
Performance conditions are weighted onethird on the achievement of an EPS target, and one-third on the achievement of an organic revenue growth target.
The remaining one-third is based on a TSR target.
The EPS vesting percentage is based on compound EPS growth.
Where compound EPS growth is between 6% and 12%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where compound EPS growth is between 12% and 15%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The organic revenue growth target is based on the Companys compound annual organic revenue growth.
Where growth is between 4% and 8% the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where the Companys compound organic revenue growth is between 8% and 10%, the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
In order for the organic revenue growth target proportion to vest, the underlying operating profit margin in the financial year of vesting must not be less than that of the underlying operating profit margin for the financial year in which the award is granted.
The final third of the award is the performance target relating to TSR which measures share price performance against a designated comparator group.
Where the Companys TSR is between median and upper quartile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7% and where the Companys TSR is between upper quartile and upper decile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The TSR vesting percentage may only exceed 26.7% stretch level if performance against either the EPS target or the organic revenue growth target is also at stretch level.
The comparator group for awards granted prior to 2016 is the companies comprised in the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period, excluding financial services and extraction companies.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The market-based performance condition were included in the fair value calculations, which were based on observable market prices at grant date.
All options granted under performance share awards have an exercise price of nil.
Awards from 2016 onwards These performance shares are subject to a service condition and two performance conditions.
Performance conditions are weighted one half on the achievement of a revenue growth target and one half on the achievement of a TSR target.
The revenue growth target is subject to two underpin performance conditions relating to EPS growth and organic revenue growth.
The revenue growth target is based on the Companys compound annual recurring revenue growth.
Where the Companys annual recurring revenue growth is between 8% and 10% or 10% and 12%, the extent to which the Revenue Performance Condition is satisfied will be calculated on a straight-line pro rata basis between 10% and 40% or between 40% and 50% respectively.
Notwithstanding the extent to which the Revenue Performance Condition has been satisfied, the Revenue Tranche will not be released and will lapse on the Boards determination that i the compound growth of the Companys underlying EPS over the Performance Period is less than 8% per annum: or ii the compound growth of the Companys organic revenue over the Performance Period is less than 6% per annum.
The performance target relating to TSR measures share price performance against a designated comparator group.
Where the Companys TSR is between median and upper quartile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 10% and 40% and where the Companys TSR is between upper quartile and upper decile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straightline pro-rata basis between 40% and 50%.
