173 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP Measures for the year ended 31st March 2017 The group uses various measures to manage its business which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles GAAP.
The groups management believes these measures provide valuable additional information to users of the accounts in understanding the groups performance.
Sales excluding precious metals sales The group believes that sales excluding precious metals is a better measure of the growth of the group than revenue.
Total revenue can be heavily distorted by year on year fluctuations in the market prices of precious metals.
In addition, in many cases, the value of precious metals is passed directly on to our customers.
Underlying profit These are the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted to exclude amortisation of acquired intangibles note 3, major impairment and restructuring charges, profit or loss on disposal of businesses, significant tax rate changes and, where relevant, related tax effects.
The group believes that these measures provide a better guide to the underlying performance of the group.
These are reconciled in note 5.
