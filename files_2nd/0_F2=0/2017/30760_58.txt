i Share options The fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2017 2016 Share price 506p 448p Exercise price 409p 351p Expected volatility 26.04% 28.29% Expected life 3.70 years 3.79 years Expected dividend yield 4.61% 4.65% Risk-free interest rate 0.55% 0.15% The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option prior to its date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.
3,094,372 options granted after 7 November 2002 were exercised during the year 2016: 4,709,978. ii Share awards The fair value of the awards was estimated on the date of grant based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2017 2016 Share price 523p 472p 1 Expected volatility 28% 25% 1 Expected volatility of comparator companies share price 26% 24% 1 Correlation between Aviva and comparator competitors share price 59% 53% 1 Expected life 2.76 years 2.66 years 2 Expected dividend yield 0.00% 4.00% 1 Risk-free interest rate 0.59% 0.59% 1 For awards with market-based performance conditions only.
2 Expected dividend yield assumption was only used to fair value LTIP awards issued in France.
In 2017, LTIP awards with no market performance conditions were issued in France therefore this assumption was not used in the year.
The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the share award prior to its date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the share awards.
