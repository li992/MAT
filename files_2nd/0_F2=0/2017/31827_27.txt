About Us Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information Other Information Alternative Performance Measures Bellway uses a variety of alternative performance measures APM which, although financial measures of either historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows, are not defined or specified by IFRSs.
The directors use a combination of APMs and IFRS measures when reviewing the performance, position and cash of the Group.
The APMs used by the Group are defined below: Pre-exceptional gross profit and pre-exceptional operating profit Both of these measures are reconciled to total gross profit and total operating profit on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The directors consider that the removal of exceptional items provide a better understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Pre-exceptional gross profit margin Pre-exceptional gross profit margin is the pre-exceptional gross profit divided by total revenue.
The directors consider this to be an important indicator of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
Administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue This is calculated as the total administrative overheads divided by total revenue.
The directors consider this to be an important indicator of how efficiently the Group is managing its administrative overhead base.
Pre-exceptional operating profit margin Pre-exceptional operating profit margin is the pre-exceptional operating profit divided by total revenue.
The directors consider this to be an important indicator of the operating performance of the Group.
