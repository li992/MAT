GOODWILL CONTINUED Management has considered the following sensitivities: Market growth and WIPOW Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and WIPOW.
The value in use calculation shows that if the long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the US and UK would still be greater than their carrying value.
Discount rate Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation.
The value in use calculation shows that for the recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have to be increased to 12% 2016: 24% for the US and 16% 2016: 38% for the UK.
Includes 0.1m on the finalisation of the accounting for prior year acquisitions previously reported on a provisional basis Included within the brand value is 11.2m relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 2006.
The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see note 12.
The remaining amortisation life for definite life brands is seven years.
