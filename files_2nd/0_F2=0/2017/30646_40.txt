8 Net finance costs Accounting policy Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial period of time to bring to use are capitalised.
All other interest on borrowings is expensed as incurred.
The cost of issuing borrowings is generally expensed over the period of borrowing so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge.
