PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2017 64 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 7.
Taxation continued The Group has chosen to use a weighted average tax rate rather than the UK rate for the reconciliation of the charge for the year to the profit before taxation per the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group operates in a number of overseas jurisdictions which have tax rates in excess of the UK rate.
As such, a weighted average tax rate is believed to provide more meaningful information to users of the Financial Statements.
The approximate tax rate for this comparison is 25.01% 2016: 24.13%.

These changes were substantively enacted as part ofFinance Bill 2015 on 26 October 2015.
These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 andto 18% from 1 April 2020.
A further change to reduce the UK rate from 1 April 2020 from 18% to 17% was announced on 16March 2016.
This change was substantively enacted as part of Finance Bill 2016 on 15 September 2016.
The weighted average tax rate based on where the Group has made profits and the tax rates applicable in those countries hasremained relatively stable when compared to the prior year.
The main movements in the tax reconciliation are explained as follows: expenses included within the Income Statement which are treated as permanent non-tax deductible items amount to 4.2m.
Included within this adjustment is a 1.1m increase to the tax charge related to a non-recurring exceptional item and a 0.9m increase from the resolution of an uncertain tax position.
the UK tax rate is due to fall to 17% from 1 April 2020.
This reduces the carrying value of the Groups net deferred tax liabilities and has lowered the tax charge for the year by 3.3m.
PZ Cussons is subject to taxation in all of the countries in which it operates.
The tax legislation applicable in these countries is often complex and subject to interpretation both by management and government authorities.
These judgemental interpretations give rise to quantifiable risks which are provided for on the Balance Sheet.
This adjustment increases the tax charge by 2.3m.
the adjustments in respect of prior periods reflect amendments to the estimated tax charge for all Group companies when compared to the final submitted tax returns.
The adjustment reduces the tax charge by 2.7m.
The resulting Income Statement tax charge for the year represents a post-exceptional effective tax rate of 23.98% 2016: 16.73%.
The Group continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and isdependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities.
In assessing these income tax uncertainties, management is required to make judgements in the determination of the unit of account, the evaluation of the circumstances, facts and other relevant information in respect of the tax position taken together with estimates of amounts that may be required to be paid in ultimate settlement with the tax authorities.
As the Group operates in a multinational tax environment, the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often complex and subject to change.
Original estimates are always refined as additional information becomes known.
Taxation on items taken directly to equity and other comprehensive income was a credit of 1.6m 2016: 1.5m charge, 1.2m charge to other comprehensive income and relates to deferred tax on pensions, revalued land and buildings, share option schemes and financial derivatives recognised in the hedging reserve.
