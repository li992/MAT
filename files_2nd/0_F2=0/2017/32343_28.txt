It is the Companys policy that a significant portion of external bank borrowings are at either xed or capped rates of interest in order to manage this risk.
The Company uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its interest rate exposure and hedge future interest rate risk for the term of the bank loan.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Company entirely from the risk ofpaying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully the cash ow risk associated with interest payments, itconsiders that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
The market values of hedging products change with interest rate uctuations, but the exposure of the Company to movements in interest rates is protected by way of the hedging products listed below.
In accordance with accounting standards, fair value is estimated by calculating the present value of future cash ows, using appropriate market discount rates.
For all derivative financial instruments this equates to a Level 2 fair value measurement as dened by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
The valuation therefore does not reect the cost or gain to the Company of cancelling its interest rate protection at the balance sheet date, which is generally a marginally higher cost or smaller gain than a market valuation.
Details of the fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments that were in place are provided below.
