Where an accounting policy is specific to a particular note to the financial statements, the policy is described in the note to which it relates and has been clearly identified in a box.
The financial statements consolidate those of The Unite Group plc, the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not as a group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and approved by the Directors.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Company is a public company and is registered in England, United Kingdom, where it is also domiciled.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 51.
In addition, section 4 of these Notes to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: details of its borrowings and interest rate swaps: and in note 5.3 its exposure to credit risk.
The Group has prepared cash flow projections three years forward to December 2020 and the Group has sufficient headroom to meet all its commitments.
The Group secured an investment grade credit rating and arranged a new 500 million unsecured debt facility during 2017 and this together with existing facilities will be sufficient to fund the Groups commitments over the next three years.
The Group maintains positive relationships with its lending banks and has historically secured new facilities before maturity dates and remained within its covenant levels.
The Group is in full compliance with its covenants at 31 December 2017 and expects to remain so.
Our debt facilities include loan-to-value, interest cover and asset class ratio, all of which have a high level of headroom.
In order to manage future financial commitments, the Group operates a formal approval process, through its Major Investment Approvals committee, to ensure appropriate review is undertaken before any transactions are agreed.
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, investment property under development, investments in subsidiaries and interest rate swaps all of which are stated at their fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has an existing right that gives it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary, has exposure or right to variable returns from its involvement in the subsidiary and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, such as property disposals and management fees, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups retained interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment in the value of fixed assets.
Impact of accounting standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective At the balance sheet date there are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet effective, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue.
The Group earns revenue from the following activities see Note 2.4 : - Rental income - Management fees - USAF performance fee Based on its assessment to date, the Group does not expect the application of IFRS 15 to result in a significant impact on revenue recognition within its consolidated financial statements.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 115 Section 1: Basis of preparation continued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
It is not expected that the transition will have any impact on the carrying value of the relevant assets and liabilities within the consolidated financial statements of the Unite Group plc.
The Group believes that its current hedge relationships will qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
IFRS 16 Leases effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 The International Accounting Standards Board issued a new lease standard IFRS 16 to replace existing lease standard IAS 17 from 1 January 2019, with early adoption possible before that date for entities that have also early adopted IFRS 15 the new revenue standard which comes into effect from 1 January 2018.
A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that lessees are required to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-ofuse asset for lease contracts, subject to exceptions for short term leases and leases of low-value assets.
An initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 has been reviewed by management and a number of leases currently in operation within the Unite Group plc will fall under the scope of IFRS 16.
The standard gives the option to either fully restate or recognise an asset equal to the value of the liability on the date of transition.
The choice of transition method will affect the materiality of the potential impact on adoption of the new standard.
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16 on both IFRS and EPRA measures and intends to adopt the new standard for the financial year ending 31 December 2019.
The impact of the new standard will depend on the transition approach adopted and the contracts in effect at the time of adoption.
It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Groups consolidated results.
More guidance will be given in the 2018 financial statements.
Other standards The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: - IFRS 2 amendments Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transaction - IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement of complexity are set out below and are explained in more detail in the related notes to the financial statements.
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: - valuation of investment property and investment property under development note 3.1 The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which is as follows: - classification of joint venture vehicles note 3.4 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 116 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 2: Results for the year This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group and provides a reconciliation between the primary statements and EPRA performance measures.
On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and net asset value per share.
The Group uses EPRA earnings and NAV movement as key comparable indicators across other real estate companies in Europe.

The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 are Operations and Property.
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.
The Groups properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom.
The Group therefore has one geographical segment.
2.2 Earnings EPRA earnings amends IFRS measures by removing principally the unrealised investment property valuation gains and losses such that users of the financials are able to see the extent to which dividend payments dividend per share are underpinned by earnings arising from purely operational activity.
The reconciliation between Profit attributable to owners of the parent company and EPRA earnings is available in note 2.2 b.
The Operations segment manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.
The way in which the Operations segment adds value to the business is set out in the Operations review on pages 32 to 35.
The Operations segment is the main contributor to EPRA earnings and EPRA EPS and these are therefore the key indicators which are used by the Board to monitor the Operations business.
The Board does not manage or monitor the Operations segment through the balance sheet and therefore no segmental information for assets and liabilities is provided for the Operations segment.

Basic EPS is adjusted in line with EPRA guidelines in order to allow users to compare the business performance of the Group with other listed real estate companies in a consistent manner and to reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis.
EPRA EPS and EPRA EPS pre yield related USAF performance fee are calculated using EPRA earnings.

Accounting policies Revenue is recognised on the following bases: Rental income Rental income from property leased out under operating leases comprising direct lets to students and leases to Universities and commercial tenants is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are sometimes granted on commercial units: these are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the term of the lease.
Management and performance fees The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
In addition, the Group is entitled to performance fees from USAF and LSAV if the joint ventures outperform certain benchmarks.
The Group receives an enhanced equity interest in the JVs as consideration for the performance fee.
Management and performance fees are recognised, in line with the management contracts, in the period to which they relate as services are provided.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 126 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.5 Tax As a REIT, rental profits and gains on disposal of investment properties are exempt from corporation tax.
The Group pays UK corporation tax on the profits from its residual business, including profits arising on construction operations and management fees received from joint ventures, together with UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries in which the Group holds a minority interest.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
As a REIT, rental profits and gains on disposal of investment properties are exempt from corporation tax.
As a result, no deferred tax provision has been recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of property assets revaluation and capital allowances.
The Groups investments in unit trusts are not exempt from tax as a REIT and, where they remain within the charge to tax, a deferred tax liability has been recognised as appropriate.
The Group will be able to utilise its tax adjusted losses against gains arising on the disposal of its investments in unit trusts.
As the deferred tax liability on non-property business investments exceeds the asset relating to the losses, the deferred tax asset in respect of the tax adjusted losses has been recognised in full.
a Tax income statement The total taxation charge credit in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Corporation tax on residual business income arising in UK companies 1.7 Income tax on UK rental income arising in non-UK companies 2.3 Current tax charge 1.7 2.3 Reversal of deferred tax provision in respect of REIT property business assets 39.8 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 4.5 13.7 Effect of change in tax rate 0.6 1.2 Deferred tax charge credit 3.9 27.3 Total tax charge credit in income statement 5.6 25.0 The Group elected to be taxed as a REIT with effect from 1 January 2017.
As a result of this, the Groups investment properties are exempt from tax and no deferred tax is required on the balance sheet in relation to these assets.
Accordingly, the Groups deferred tax now only relates to non-property investments being primarily its interests in joint ventures and historic tax losses.
The movement in deferred tax provided is shown in more detail in note 2.5 d below.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 127 Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.5 Tax continued a Tax income statement continued In the income statement, a tax charge of 5.6 million arises on a profit before tax of 229.4 million.
The taxation charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 2017 2016 m m Profit before tax 229.4 201.4 Income tax using the UK corporation tax rate of 19.25% 2016: 20% 44.2 40.3 Release of deferred tax balances due to REIT conversion 39.8 Property rental business profits exempt from tax in the REIT Group 11.2 Property revaluations not subject to tax 25.0 20.4 Effect of indexation on investments 1.1 2.1 Effect of statutory tax reliefs 0.6 1.5 Income due to Unite Foundation 1.0 Effect of tax deduction transferred to equity on share schemes 0.5 0.4 Rate difference on deferred tax 0.5 1.2 Prior years adjustments 0.7 0.3 Total tax charge credit in income statement 5.6 25.0 The main rate of corporation tax reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017.
Accordingly, the reconciliation above has been calculated at a rate of 19.25% 2016: 20%.
As a UK REIT, the Group is exempt from UK corporation tax on the profits from its property rental business.
Accordingly, the element of the Group's profit before tax relating to its property rental business has been separately identified in the reconciliation above.
"Although the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on the profits from its property rental business, it is required to distribute 90% of the profits from its property rental business after accounting for tax adjustments as a Property Income Distribution ""PID""."
PIDs are charged to tax in the same way as property income in the hands of the recipient.
For the year ended 31 December 2017 the required PID is expected to be 40.7m of which 36.7m has been distributed at the year end, with the remainder to be distributed in May 2018.
The UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
b Tax other comprehensive income Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling nil 2016: 1.6 million credit has been recognised representing deferred tax.
An analysis of this is included in the deferred tax movement on page 128. c Tax statement of changes in equity Within the statement of changes in equity a tax credit totalling 0.7 million 2016: 0.1 million charge has been recognised representing deferred tax.

The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on the rate at which it is expected to reverse.
As a REIT, disposals of investment property are exempt from tax and as a result no deferred tax liability has been recognised in relation to these assets.
The Group's investments in property unit trusts being primarily its interests in joint ventures are not exempt from tax as a REIT.
Where they remain within the charge to tax, a deferred tax liability has been recognised on the excess of the market value of these assets over their historic tax base cost.
At 31 December 2017 the deferred tax liability in relation to these investments was 20.6m.
Company Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary differences of 165.9 million 2016: 118.9 million in respect of revaluation of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is considered unlikely that these investments will be divested.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 129 Section 3: Asset management The Group holds its property portfolio directly and through its joint ventures.
The performance of the property portfolio whether wholly owned or in joint ventures is the key factor that drives net asset value NAV, one of the Groups key performance indicators.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups investments in property assets and joint ventures and their performance over the year.
3.1 Wholly owned property assets The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is held in two groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below.
In the Groups EPRA NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.
i Investment property fixed assets These are assets that the Group intends to hold for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation.
The assets are held at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
ii Investment property under development fixed assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Investment property on completion.
Accounting policies Properties held under operating leases are not included in assets, but the future payments due in respect of these properties are disclosed in note 4.6a.
Investment property and investment property under development are held at fair value.
Inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts.
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if development activities are suspended.
If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate.
During the year the average capitalisation rate used was 6.1% 2016: 6.4%.
The external valuation of property assets involves significant judgement and changes to the core assumptions: market conditions, rental income, occupancy and property management costs, could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets.
See below for more details of the valuation process.
Valuation process The valuations of the properties are performed twice a year on the basis of valuation reports prepared by external, independent valuers, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification.
The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd and Messrs Knight Frank, Chartered Surveyors were the valuers in the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016.
The valuations are based on both: - Information provided by the Group such as current rents, occupancy, operating costs, terms and conditions of leases and nomination agreements, capital expenditure, etc.
This information is derived from the Groups financial systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment.
- Assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers the assumptions are typically market related, such as yield and discount rates.
These are based on their professional judgement and market observation.
The information provided to the valuers and the assumptions and the valuation models used by the valuers are reviewed by the Management Board and the CFO.
This includes a review of the fair value movements over the year.

Where the asset is leased to a University, the valuations also reflect the length of the lease, the allocation of maintenance and insurance responsibilities between the Group and the lessee, and the markets general perception of the lessees credit worthiness.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the capital value per bed derived from actual market transactions.
For development properties, the fair value is usually calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the discounted cash flow method less estimated costs to completion.

Land and buildings are stated at fair value on the same basis as investment properties.
Property, plant and equipment mainly comprise leasehold improvements at the Groups head office and London office as well as computer hardware and software at these sites.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: - Leasehold Shorter life of lease and economic life improvements - Other assets 420 years Intangible assets Intangible assets predominately comprise internally developed computer software which allows customers to book online and processes transactions within the sales cycle.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense incurred, 2017: nil, 2016: nil.
The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 4 to 7 years being the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement within operating expenses.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 134 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 3: Asset management continued 3.4 Investments in joint ventures Group Accounting policies Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Groups share of total gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity basis.
Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value the difference between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture.
The implied discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment loan.
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control: a significant degree of judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.
USAF and LSAV are jointly owned entities that are accounted for as joint ventures.
Due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements and Unites role as manager of the joint venture vehicles, the assessment of joint control following changes to accounting standards IFRS10 involves judgements around a number of significant factors.
These factors include how Unite as fund manager has the ability to direct relevant activities such as acquisitions, disposals, capital expenditure for refurbishments and funding whether through debt or equity.
This assessment for USAF is complex because of the number of unitholders and how their rights are represented through an Advisory Committee.
For some of the activities it is not clear who has definitive control of the activities: in some scenarios the Group can control, in others the Advisory Committee.
However, for the activities which are considered to have the greatest impact on the returns of USAF, acquisitions and equity financing, it has been determined that the Group and the Advisory Committee has joint power in directing these activities and that on balance, it is appropriate to account for USAF as a joint venture.
The assessment for LSAV is more straightforward because the Group and GIC each own 50% of the joint venture and there is therefore much clearer evidence that control over the key activities is shared by the two parties.
The Group has two joint ventures: Groups share of assets results 2017 Legal entity in which Joint venture 2016 Objective Partner Group has interest The UNITE UK Student 26.2% 24.6% Invest and operate Consortium of investors UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund student accommodation Accommodation Fund, USAF throughout the UK a Jersey Unit Trust London Student 50% 50% Develop and operate GIC Real Estate Pte, Ltd LSAV Unit Trust, a Jersey Unit Accommodation Venture student accommodation in Trust and LSAV Holdings Ltd, Real estate LSAV London incorporated in Jersey investment vehicle of the Government of Singapore Part of the Groups interest is held through a subsidiary, USAF Feeder Guernsey Ltd, in which there is an external investor.
A minority interest therefore occurs on consolidation of the Groups results representing the external investors share of profits and assets relating to its investment in USAF.
The ordinary shareholders of The Unite Group plc are beneficially interested in 24.6% 2016: 23.0% of USAF.
Net assets and profit for the year above include the minority interest, whereas EPRA net assets exclude the minority interest.

These were primarily provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties.
As a result of being provided interest free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Groups finance income.
c Transactions with joint ventures The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
The Group receives an enhanced equity interest in the joint ventures as consideration for the performance fee.
The Group has recognised the following fees in its results for the year.
2017 2016 m m USAF 13.1 12.8 LSAV 7.9 8.0 Asset and property management fees 21.0 20.8 LSAV 1.0 Development management fees 1.0 USAF performance fee 4.0 8.1 USAF acquisition fee 0.7 0.5 LSAV acquisition fee 1.0 Investment management fees 5.7 8.6 Total fees 26.7 30.4 Included in the movement in EPRA NAV is a USAF performance fee of 3.4million 2016: 6.5 million.
This is the gross fee of 4.0 million 2016: 8.1 million paid by USAF net of advisory fee costs of nil million 2016: 0.5 million and a 0.6 million 2016: 1.1 million adjustment related to trading with joint ventures.
The USAF performance fee will be settled in units in The UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund rather than cash.
Full details of the USAF performance fees are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 51.
Included in share of joint venture profit in the income statement is a share of joint venture property management fee costs of 1.2 million 2016: 1.6 million.
On an EPRA basis these costs are deducted from the property management fees shown above, plus an adjustment for the minority interest of 0.2 million 2016: 0.4 million.
This results in the net fees included in the Operating Segment result note 2.2a of 14.1 million 2016: 14.0 million.
Development management fees are included in the Property Segment result note 2.2a.
Investment management fees are included within the unallocated to segments note 2.2a.
Included in the movement in EPRA NAV is a USAF property acquisition fee of 0.4 million 2016: 0.4 million.
This is the gross fee of 1.0 million 2016: 0.5 million paid by USAF net of a 0.3 million 2016: 0.1 million adjustment related to trading with joint ventures and a 0.3 million 2016: nil adjustment relating to other acquisition costs paid to a third party.
Included in the movement in EPRA NAV is an LSAV property acquisition fee of 0.5 million 2016: nil.
This is the gross fee of 1.0 million 2016: nil paid by LSAV net of a 0.5 million 2016: nil adjustment related to trading with joint ventures.
During the year the Group has paid operating lease rentals to USAF relating to one property under a sale and leaseback agreement amounting to 0.7 million 2016: 2.2 million.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 138 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 3: Asset management continued 3.4 Investments in joint ventures Group continued c Transactions with joint ventures continued During the year the Group recognised additional proceeds of 2 million in relation to the sale of a property to LSAV in 2015 under the terms of the original sale agreement.
At the balance sheet date the proceeds had not been settled and therefore no cash flows have been disclosed.
In 2016 the Group sold two properties to USAF for 88.4 million.
Both properties had been held on the balance sheet as investment property under development within non-current assets, the proceeds and carrying value of the property are therefore recognised in profit on disposal of property and the cash flows in investing activities.
The profits relating to sales and associated disposal costs and related cash flows are set out below: Profit and loss Profit and loss 2017 2016 LSAV USAF m m Included in profit on disposal of property net of joint venture trading adjustment 1.0 3.2 Profit on disposal of property 1.0 3.2 Cash flow Cash flow 2017 2016 LSAV USAF m m Gross proceeds 88.4 Net cash flows included in cash flows from investing activities 88.4 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 139 Section 3: Asset management continued 3.5 Investments in subsidiaries Company Accounting policies In the financial statements of the Company, investments in subsidiaries are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the revaluation reserve in equity.
Carrying value of investment in subsidiaries The movements in the Companys interest in unlisted subsidiaries and joint ventures during the year are as follows: Investment in subsidiaries 2017 2016 m m At 1 January 725.4 648.3 Revaluation 201.2 77.1 At 31 December 926.6 725.4 The carrying value of investment in subsidiaries has been calculated using the equity attributable to the owners of the parent company from the consolidated balance sheet adjusted for the fair value of fixed rate loans.
This includes investment property, investment property under development and swaps at a fair value calculated by a third party expert.
All investment properties and investment properties under development are classified as Level 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been discussed on page 132.
The fixed rate loans range between Level 1 and Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been discussed further on page 140.
In addition to the equity investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company has provided a loan with interest chargeable at 6.125% to LDC Holdings plc.
The carrying value of the loan to LDC Holdings plc was 90.0 million 2016: 90.0 million.
A further loan of 89.9 million 2016: 89.9 million was provided to LDC Holdings plc with interest chargeable at 5.0%: this loan was fully repaid during the year.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 140 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 4: Funding The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and equity.
The Group continuously monitors its financing arrangements to manage its gearing.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups risk to fluctuations in interest rate movements.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups funding position, including borrowings, gearing and hedging instruments: its exposure to market risks: and its capital management policies.
The Merger reserve arose on the acquisition of the Unilodge portfolio in June 2001.
4.1 Borrowings Accounting policies Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
On 10 October 2013 the Group issued a convertible bond.
The unsecured instrument paid a coupon of 2.5%.
In accordance with IFRS, the equity and debt components of the bond were accounted for separately.
As a result, 80.3 million was recognised as a liability in the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, 9.6 million, which represents the equity component, was credited to reserves.
The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value was amortised through the income statement from the date of issue.
Issue costs of 2.0m were allocated between equity and debt and the element relating to the debt component was amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity of 0.2 million were not amortised.
The full principal value of the Groups convertible bond 89.9 million converted into equity in June with the issue of 18,593,589 ordinary shares in Unite Group plc.
The table below analyses the Groups borrowings which comprise bank and other loans by when they fall due for payment: Group Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 Carrying value Carrying value Carrying value Carrying value m m m m Current In one year or less, or on demand 1.3 1.3 2.9 0.1 Non-current In more than one year but not more than two years 1.4 108.1 85.3 In more than two years but not more than five years 379.4 126.3 267.6 90.0 In more than five years 130.7 239.1 511.5 473.5 267.6 175.3 Total borrowings 512.8 474.8 270.5 175.4 In addition to the borrowings currently drawn as shown above, the Group has available undrawn facilities of 327.0 million 2016: 245.0 million.
A further overdraft facility of 10.0 million 2016: 10.0 million is also available.
Properties with a carrying value of 609.1 million 2016: 998.0 million have been pledged as security against the Groups drawn down borrowings.
The carrying value of borrowings is considered to be approximate to fair value, except for the Groups fixed rate loans as analysed below: 2017 2016 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value m m m m Level 1 IFRS fair value hierarchy 90.0 96.1 176.2 212.5 Level 2 IFRS fair value hierarchy 239.1 263.8 240.3 215.0 Other loans 183.7 183.7 58.3 54.7 Total borrowings 512.8 543.6 474.8 482.2 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 141 Section 4: Funding continued 4.1 Borrowings continued The fair value of loans classified as Level 1 in the IFRS fair value hierarchy is determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities.
The fair value of loans classified as Level 2 in the IFRS fair value hierarchy has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectation of future interest rates.
4.2 Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes and only holds swaps which are considered to be commercially effective.
Accounting policies Interest rate swaps are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark to market movements recognised in the income statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
Hedge accounting, as defined in IFRS, is when the interest rate swap is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to the interest risk of borrowings.
The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group only applies hedge accounting when the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity with any subsequent movements in fair value taken to the income statement.
If the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit-worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The following table shows the fair value of interest rate swaps: 2017 2016 m m Current Non-current 0.8 11.6 Fair value of interest rate swaps 0.8 11.6 The fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates, representing Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
4.3 Net financing costs Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable on funds invested both calculated using the effective interest rate method and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.

The overall average cost of investment debt on an EPRA basis is 4.1% 2016: 4.2%.
4.4 Gearing The Groups adjusted gearing ratio is a key indicator that the Group uses to manage its indebtedness.
EPRA net asset value NAV and adjusted net debt are used to calculate adjusted gearing.
Adjusted net debt excludes mark to market of interest rate swaps as shown below.
The Groups gearing ratios are calculated as follows: 2017 2016 Note m m Cash and cash equivalents 5.1 51.2 42.7 Current borrowings 4.1 1.3 1.3 Non-current borrowings 4.1 511.5 473.5 Interest rate swaps liabilities 4.2 0.8 11.6 Net debt per balance sheet 462.4 443.7 Mark to market of interest rate swaps 0.8 11.6 Adjusted net debt 461.6 432.1 Reported net asset value attributable to owners of the parent company 2.3c 1,729.0 1,451.6 EPRA net asset value 2.3c 1,740.4 1,557.3 Gearing Basic Net debt Reported net asset value 27% 31% Adjusted gearing Adjusted net debt EPRA net asset value 27% 28% Gearing EPRA net debt EPRA net asset value 2.3a 46% 50% Loan to value EPRA net debt Total property portfolio 2.3a 31% 34% THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 143 Section 4: Funding continued 4.5 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks primarily interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by significant changes in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is separated into two main areas: i Development and refinancing The Group had no specific development borrowings as at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates which affect the amount of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups ability to release equity from its developments.
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment.
The Groups policy allows this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps.
ii Medium and long-term finance The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under both floating and fixed rate arrangements.
The majority of this floating debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
The Groups policy guideline has been to hedge 75% and 95% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 210 years.
At 31 December 2017, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 64% 2016: 100% of the Groups medium and long-term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates: however further contracted hedging with a forward start state and planned fixed rate funding will increase the hedge ratio to above 90% over the next 18 months.
Excluding the 4.7 million 2016: 92.9 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 5.2% 2016: 4.6% for an average period of 4.5 years 2016: 5 years, including all debt with current or forward starting swaps the average rate is 4.0% 2016: 4.4%.
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2017 against 4.7 million 2016: 92.9 million of the Groups borrowings.
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 Nominal Applicable Nominal Applicable amount hedged interest rates amount hedged interest rates m % m % Within one year Between one and two years Between two and five years 4.7 2.1 47.6 1.8 More than five years 45.3 2.2 During the year, if interest rates had increased decreased by 1%, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.8 million 2016: 0.6 million lower higher.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
For development activities, the Group has a policy to inject substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the specific facility for the development.
The funding requirements of each scheme are therefore substantially ring-fenced and secured at the outset of works.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and interest rate swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the period remaining until the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest, so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

c Covenant compliance Many of the Groups funding facilities carry covenants.
The Group monitors its covenant position and the headroom available on an ongoing basis.
At 31 December 2017, the Group was in full compliance with all of its borrowing covenants.
The Group is able to use available cash to reduce debt to increase headroom on its loan to value LTV covenants.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 145 Section 4: Funding continued 4.6 Operating leases a Payable Accounting policies Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Where the property interest under an operating lease is classified as an investment property, the property interest is accounted for as if it were a finance lease and the fair value model is used for the asset recognised.
The Group has a number of sale and leaseback properties which are accounted for as operating leases.
The total future minimum lease rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases fall due for repayment as follows: 2017 2016 m m Less than one year 13.1 13.8 Between one and five years 52.7 56.2 More than five years 152.0 171.0 Total 217.8 241.0 These leases primarily relate to properties which the Group has sold and leased back and on which rental income is earned.
The leases are generally for periods between 12 and 17 years and subject to annual RPI-based rent review.
The total operating lease expenditure incurred during the year was 14.5 million 2016: 15.3 million.
b Receivable The Group accounts for its tenancy contracts offered to commercial and individual tenants as operating leases.
The future minimum lease payments receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Less than one year 131.0 77.1 Between one and five years 177.5 140.4 More than five years 262.3 267.2 Total 570.8 484.7 4.7 Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and adjusted net debt, including cash held on deposit.
The Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
The components and calculation of adjusted net debt is set out in note 4.4.
Capital is managed so as to continue as a going concern and to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders and joint venture partners.
The Group uses a number of key metrics to manage its capital structure: - adjusted net debt 4.4 - adjusted gearing 4.4 - LTV 2.3a - weighted average cost of investment debt 4.5aii In order to manage levels of adjusted gearing over the medium term, the Group seeks to deliver NAV growth and to recycle capital invested in lower performing assets into new assets and property developments.
29.6 million of property assets were sold in 2017 and we plan to sell an average of 75 125 million of property each year.
The Group targets a yield on cost of approximately 8%.
The Group does not commit to developing new sites until sufficient equity and funding to fulfil the full cost of the development is secure.
The Board monitors the ability of the Group to pay dividends out of available cash and distributable profits.
The Operations Segment generated cash of 63.2 million 2016: 61.3 million during the year, thereby covering the combined paid interim dividend and proposed final dividend of 54.8 million, 1.2 times 2016: 40.0 million, 1.5 times.

4.9 Dividends Accounting policies Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.
During the year, the Company declared and paid an interim dividend of 17.7 million 7.3p per share 2016: 13.2 million 6.0p per share and paid a 26.7 million final dividend 12.0p per share relating to the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: 21.0 million 9.5p per share.
After the year end, the Directors proposed a final dividend per share of 15.4p 2016: 12.0p, bringing the total dividend per share for the year to 22.7p 2016: 18.0p.
No provision has been made in relation to this dividend.
The Group has modelled tax adjusted property business profits for five years and declared PIDs in respect of the May 2017 and November 2017 distributions to ensure that the PID requirement will be satisfied.
The combined PID from the distributions made during 2017 comprise 78% of the Groups forecast tax exempt property rental business profit, leaving a small amount that can be paid as part of the May 2018 distribution.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 147 Section 5: Working capital This section focuses on how the Group generates its operating cash flows.
Careful management of working capital is vital to ensure that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
On the following pages you will find disclosures around the Groups cash position and how cash is generated from the Groups trading activities, and disclosures around trade receivables and payables.
5.1 Cash and cash equivalents Accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
The Groups cash position at 31 December 2017 was 51.2 million 2016: 42.7 million.
At 31 December 2017 the Company had an overdraft of 2.9 million 2016: overdraft 0.1 million.
The Groups cash balances include 3.1 million 2016: 13.4 million whose use at the balance sheet date is restricted by funding agreements to pay operating costs and loan interest relating to specific properties.
The Group generates cash from its operating activities as follows: Group Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 Note m m m m Profit loss for the year 223.8 226.4 197.9 213.8 Adjustments for: Depreciation and amortisation 3.3 7.0 4.4 Fair value of share based payments 6.1 1.5 1.2 Dividends received 139.3 Change in value of investment property 3.1 103.1 77.2 Change in value of investments 3.5 201.2 77.1 Net finance costs 4.3 28.7 21.8 0.5 0.3 Profit on disposal of investment property 0.6 0.4 Share of joint venture profit 3.4b 103.1 94.8 Trading with joint venture adjustment 7.2 7.5 Tax charge credit 2.5a 5.6 25.0 Cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital 67.0 63.9 2.8 2.9 Decrease in trade and other receivables 13.2 20.4 Decrease increase in inventories 2.3 0.7 Increase in trade and other payables 6.9 26.1 2.5 0.3 Cash flows from operating activities 58.4 70.3 0.3 2.6 8.1 million of the brought forward trade and other receivables was settled in units in USAF rather than cash.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 148 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 5: Working capital continued 5.2 Trade and other receivables Accounting policies Trade receivables are initially recognised at the amount invoiced to the customer fair value and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Board, be collected.
These estimates include such factors as historical experience and industry specific factors.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows: all trade and other receivables are current.
Group Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Trade receivables 19.4 17.8 Amounts due from group undertakings 912.1 686.4 Amounts owed by joint ventures 41.8 36.3 Prepayments and accrued income 11.0 8.4 USAF performance fee 4.0 8.1 Other receivables 6.7 7.3 Trade and other receivables 82.9 77.9 912.1 686.4 The USAF performance fee will be settled in units in USAF.
The Group offers tenancy contracts to commercial Universities and retail unit tenants and individual tenants based on the academic year.
The Group monitors and manages the recoverability of its receivables based on the academic year to which the amounts relate.
Rental income is payable immediately, therefore all receivables relating to tenants are past the payment due date.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 149 Section 5: Working capital continued 5.2 Trade and other receivables continued Movements in the Groups provision for impairment of trade receivables can be shown as follows: 2017 2016 m m At 1 January 1.4 2.1 Impairment charged to income statement in year 0.5 0.7 Receivables written off during the year utilisation of provision 0.1 1.4 At 31 December 1.8 1.4 5.3 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
It arises principally from the Groups cash balances, the Groups receivables from customers and joint ventures and loans provided to the Groups joint ventures.
At the year end, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: 2017 2016 Note m m Cash 5.1 51.2 42.7 Trade receivables 5.2 19.4 17.8 Amounts due from joint ventures excluding loans that are capital in nature 5.2 41.8 36.3 112.4 96.8 a Cash The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by credit rating agencies and credit default swap rates.
b Trade receivables The Groups customers can be split into two groups i students individuals and ii commercial organisations including Universities.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced by the characteristics of each customer.
The Group holds tenant deposits of 9.0 million 2016: 8.5 million as collateral against individual customers.
Based on the Groups experience and historical low level of bad debt the Group views these receivables as recoverable balances with a low risk of default.
c Joint ventures Amounts receivable from joint ventures fall into two categories working capital balances and investment loans.
The Group has strong working relationships with its joint venture partners and therefore views this as a low credit risk balance.
5.4 Trade and other payables Accounting policies Trade payables are initially recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The carrying value of trade payables is considered approximate to fair value.
Trade and other payables due within one year can be analysed as follows: Group Company 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Trade payables 19.7 16.8 Retentions on construction contracts for properties 7.8 5.8 Amounts due to group undertakings 2.5 1.3 Other payables and accrued expenses 67.1 45.8 3.2 3.0 Deferred income 57.5 55.3 Trade and other payables 152.1 123.7 5.7 4.3 Other payable and accrued expenses include 9.0million 2016: 8.5 million in relation to customer deposits.
These will be returned at the end of the tenancy subject to the condition of the accommodation and payment of any outstanding amounts.
Deferred income relates to rental income that has been collected in advance of it being recognised as revenue.
