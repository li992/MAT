Trade and Other Receivables Trade receivables are recognised at amortised cost less impairment losses.
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
