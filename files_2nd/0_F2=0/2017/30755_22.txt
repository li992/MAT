The Groups principal operations are carried out in the United Kingdom, Germany and France.
The Company is registered in the UK, registration number 2714781, with its registered address at 86 Bondway, London, SW81SF.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
2 Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Group financial statements are set out below.
Thesepolicies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors Report on page 79 and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations, and the provisions of the Companies Act2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
New standards and interpretations In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017.
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Amendments to The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 7 for the first time in the current year.
The IAS 7 Disclosure amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to Initiative evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes.
The Groups liabilities arising from financing activities consist of borrowings note 21 and certain derivatives note 22.
A reconciliation between the opening and closing balances of these items is provided in note 28.
Consistent with the transition provisions of the amendments, the Group has not disclosed comparative information for the prior year.
Apart from the additional disclosure in note 28, the application of these amendments has had no impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Amendments The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 12 for the first time in the current year.
to IAS 12 Theamendments clarify how an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient future Recognition of taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible temporary difference.
The application of Deferred Tax Assets these amendments has had no impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements as the for Unrealised Group already assesses the sufficiency of future taxable profits in a way that is consistent with Losses theseamendments.
Annual The Group has adopted the amendments to IFRS 12 included in the Annual Improvements to Improvements to IFRSs20142016 Cycle for the first time in the current year.
The other amendments included in this IFRSs 20142016 package are not yet mandatorily effective and they have not been early adopted by the Group.
IFRS 12 Cycle states that an entity need not provide summarised financial information for interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are classified or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale.
The amendments clarify that this is the only concession from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 12 for such interests.
94 CLS Holdings plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | Corporate governance | Financial statements | Additional information CLS Holdings plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs thathave been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 2009, 2010 and 2014 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts IFRS 2 amendments Classification and measurement of share based payment transactions IFRS 4 amendments Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts IAS 40 amendments Transfers of investment property Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 20122014 Cycle IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency transactions and advanced consideration IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods except for a reclassification arising as a result of IFRS 9.
Listed equity securities see note 16 are currently treated as available for sale assets under IAS 39 and are held at market value on the balance sheet with movements in fair value being recognised directly in equity through other comprehensive income.
On derecognition or impairment of these assets, any gains previously recognised in equity are recycled to the income statement.
Under IFRS 9, this accounting treatment will change and fair value movements will be recognised directly in the income statement.
On transition to IFRS 9 this will result in a material reclassification of the available for sale reserve to retained earnings.
At 31 December 2017 the amount to be reclassified on transition was 17.9 million.
In relation to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers the Groups material revenue stream relates to property rental income.
On the adoption of the standard this revenue stream will not be materially impacted due to property rental income continuing to be within the scope of IAS 17 Leases and therefore is out of scope.
In relation to IFRS 16 which has not yet been endorsed by the EU as the Group is predominantly a lessor this standard will not have a material impact on adoption.
Where the Group is currently a lessee, this relates to immaterial contracts.
2.2 Business Combinations i Subsidiary undertakings Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity or business to benefit from its activities.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date control ceases.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
ii Associates Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence but which are not subsidiary undertakings or joint ventures.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
iii Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value ofidentifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
It is initially recognised as an asset atcost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as anasset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
95 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued 31 December 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued 2.3 Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date, and differences arising on translation are recognised in profit before tax.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities classified as available-for-sale and denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit before tax where the translation difference results from changes in the amortised cost of the security, andare recognised in equity where it results from other changes in the carrying amount of the security.
ii Consolidation of foreign entities The results and financial position of all Group entities which have a functional currency different from sterling are translated into sterling as follows: a assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: b income and expenses for each income statement are translated at the average exchange rates: and c all resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the cumulative translation reserve.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to the cumulative translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised as part of the gain or loss on sale in profit beforetax.
2.4 Investment properties Investment properties are those properties held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
Additions to investment properties comprise costs of a capital nature: in the case of investment properties under development, these include capitalised interest and certain staff costs directly attributable to the management of the development.
Capitalised interest is calculated at the rate on associated borrowings applied to direct expenditure between the date of gaining planning consent and the date of practical completion.
The acquisition of an investment property is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the Group, typically on unconditional exchange of contracts or when legal title passes.
Profit on sale of an investment property is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, typically on unconditional exchange of contracts or when legal title passes.
Investment properties are carried at fair value, based on market value as determined by professional external valuers at thebalance sheet date.
Investment properties being redeveloped for continuing use as investment properties, or for which themarket has become less active, continue to be classified as investment properties and measured at fair value.
Changesinfair values are recognised in profit before tax.
2.5 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at fair value, based on market value as determined by professional external valuers at the balance sheet date, except for fixtures and fittings which are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation andany recognised impairment loss.
96 CLS Holdings plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | Corporate governance | Financial statements | Additional information CLS Holdings plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost less estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives, as follows: Fixtures and fittings 45 years Freehold property 6 years Hotel 20 years Holiday cottages and cabins 2030 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit before tax.
2.6 Financial instruments i Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including swaps and interest rate caps, to help manage its interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value.
Revaluation gains and losses are recognised in profit before tax, except for derivatives which qualify as effective cash flow hedges, thegains and losses relating to which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
ii Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments are initially measured at cost, and are subsequently revalued to fair value.
Revaluation gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets.
On disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income isrecycled through profit before tax.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which arereadily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
iv Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the receivable in full.
Trade and other payables are stated atcost, whichequates to fair value.
v Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, borrowings are stated atamortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised inprofit before tax over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
2.7 Revenue i Rental income Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The cost of incentives isrecognised over the lease term, on a straight-line basis, as a reduction of rental income.
ii Service charge income Service charge income is recognised on a gross basis in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
97 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued 31 December 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued 2.8 Income tax Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying value ofassets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the values used for tax purposes.
Temporary differences are not provided for when they arise from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities inatransaction that does not affect accounting or taxable profit.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount ofassets and liabilities, and is calculated using rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, in the tax jurisdiction in which the temporary differences arise.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in arriving at profit after tax, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax isalso recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset if they relate to income taxes levied by thesame taxation authority, there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical accounting judgements In accordance with IAS 1, the Directors have considered the judgements that have been made in the process of applying theGroups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, and which of those judgements have the most significant effecton amounts recognised in the financial statements.
In the Directors opinion for the year ended 31 December 2017 there are no accounting judgements that are material to the financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The Group uses the valuations performed by its independent external valuers as the fair value of its investment properties.
Thevaluations are based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, future development costs and an appropriate discount rate see note 13 for more detail.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence oftransaction prices for similar properties.
4 Segment information The Group has two operating divisions Investment Property and Other Investments.
Other Investments comprise the hotel at Spring Mews, corporate bonds, shares in Catena AB and First Camp Sverige Holding AB, and other small corporate investments.
The Group manages the Investment Property division on a geographical basis due to its size and geographical diversity.
Consequently, the Groups principal operating segments are: Investment Property: United Kingdom Germany France Sweden Other Investments There are no transactions between the operating segments.
Previously, the United Kingdom segment was split between London and the Rest of United Kingdom.
From 2017, the management of the United Kingdom portfolio has merged and comparative data has been restated to reflect this change.

11 Earnings per share Management has chosen to disclose the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA measure of earnings per share which has been provided to give relevant information to investors on the long-term performance of the Groups underlying property investment business.
The EPRA measure excludes items which are non-recurring in nature such as profits net of related tax on sale of investment properties and of other non-current investments, and items which have no impact to earnings over their life, such as the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments and the net movement on revaluation of investment properties, and the related deferred taxation on these items.

In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in circulation and earnings per share have been restated as if the subdivision were effective from 1 January 2016.
12 Net assets per share Management has chosen to disclose the two European Public Real Estate Association EPRA measures of net assets per share: EPRA net assets per share and EPRA triple net assets per share.
The EPRA net assets per share measure highlights the fair value of equity on a long-term basis, and so excludes items which have no impact on the Group in the long term, such as fair value movements of derivative financial instruments and deferred tax on the fair value of investment properties.
The EPRA triple net assets per share measure discloses net assets per share on a true fair value basis: all balance sheet items are included at their fair value in arriving at this measure, including deferred tax, fixed-rate loan liabilities and any other balance sheet items not reported at fair value.

Valuations were based on current prices in an active market for all properties.
Theproperty valuations were carried out by external, professionally qualified valuers as follows: United Kingdom: Cushman and Wakefield 2016: Cushman and Wakefield: Knight Frank Germany: Cushman and Wakefield France: Jones Lang LaSalle Property valuations are complex and require a degree of judgement and are based on data which is not publicly available.
Consistent with EPRA guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
Inputs into the valuations include equivalent yields and rental income and are described as unobservable as per IFRS 13.
These inputs are analysed by segment in the property portfolio information on the inside front cover.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst an increase in equivalent nominal yield would result in a fall in value and vice versa.
Investment properties included leasehold properties with a carrying amount of 73.1 million 2016: 48.1 million.
Interestcapitalised within capital expenditure in the year amounted to 0.1 million 2016: 0.7 million.
Where the Group leases out its investment property under operating leases the duration is typically three years or more.
Nocontingent rents have been recognised in either the current or the comparative year.
Substantially all investment properties and the hotel detailed in note 14 are secured against debt.
In 2010 the Group purchased a property in London for 1.8 million.
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, should the sitebe developed, additional consideration may become due to the vendor.

The majority of deferred tax assets recognised within the other category relate either to deferred tax on swaps with a negative book value or to corporate bonds carried at below cost.
Losses recognised as deferred tax assets can be carried forward without restriction.

The average period to maturity of these interest rate swaps was 3.9 years 2016: 4.9 years.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to add certainty to, and to minimise the impact of foreign exchange movements on, committed cash flows.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had 23.3 million of outstanding netforeign exchange contracts 2016: 18.4 million.
23 Financial instruments Categories of financial instruments Financial assets of the Group comprise: interest rate caps: foreign currency forward contracts: available-for-sale investments: investments in associates: trade and other receivables: and cash and cash equivalents.
Financial liabilities of the Group comprise: interest rate swaps: forward foreign currency contracts: bank loans: debenture loans: zero coupon notes: unsecured bonds: secured notes: trade and other payables: and current tax liabilities.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: a Interest rate swaps and caps are measured at the present value of future cash flows based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
b Foreign currency options and forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
c The fair values of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices.
Financial assets in this category include availablefor-sale instruments such as listed corporate bonds and equity investments.
d In more illiquid conditions, non-derivative financial assets are valued using multiple quotes obtained from market makers and from pricing specialists.
Where the spread of prices is tightly clustered the consensus price is deemed to be fair value.
Where prices become more dispersed or there is a lack of available quoted data, further procedures are undertaken such as evidence from the last non-forced trade.
e The fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis, using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.

Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity balances.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents, other investments and equity attributable to the owners of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Management perform stress tests of the Groups business model to ensure that the Groups objectives can be met.
The objectives have been met in the year.
The Directors review the capital structure on a quarterly basis to ensure that key strategic goals are being achieved.
As part ofthis review they consider the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows: 2017 2016 m m Debt 914.3 854.4 Liquid resources 206.7 164.1 Net debt 707.5 690.3 Equity 1,033.3 882.5 Net debt to equity ratio 68% 78% Debt is defined as long-term and short-term borrowings before unamortised issue costs as detailed in note 21.
Liquid resources are cash and short-term deposits and listed corporate bonds.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to the owners of the Company.
Externally imposed capital requirement At 31 December 2017 the Group was subject to a minimum equity ratio of total equity to total assets of 22.5% imposed by unsecured bonds of 65.0 million 2016: 65.0 million.
The Group was also restricted from making distributions to shareholders ifto do so would reduce net assets below 250 million, imposed by unsecured bonds of 65.0 million 2016: 65.0 million.
Additionally, the Group was subject to externally imposed capital requirements to the extent that debt covenants may require Group companies to maintain ratios such as debt to equity or similar below certain levels.
Risk management objectives The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which can be grouped as: market risk credit risk liquidity risk The Groups overall risk management approach seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance whilst maintaining flexibility.
Risk management is carried out by the Groups treasury department in close co-operation with the Groups operating units and with guidance from the Board of Directors.
The Board regularly assesses and reviews the financial risks and exposures of the Group.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and to a lesser extent other price risk.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk and also uses natural hedging strategies such as matching the duration, interest payments and currency of assets and liabilities.
113 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued 31 December 2017 23 Financial instruments continued i Interest rate risk The Groups most significant interest rate risk arises from its long-term variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored by the treasury department and by the Board on both a country and a Group basis.
The Boards policy is to mitigate variable interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the flexibility to borrow at the best rates and with consideration to potential penalties on termination of fixed rate loans.
To manage its exposure the Group uses interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and natural hedging from cash held on deposit.
In assessing risk, a range of scenarios is taken into consideration such as refinancing, renewal of existing positions and alternative financing and hedging.
Under these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement for a defined movement in the underlying interest rate.
The impact of a reasonably likely movement in interest rates is set out below: 2017 2016 Income Income statement statement Scenario m m Cash 50 basis points 0.7 0.5 Variable borrowings including caps 50 basis points 2.4 2.8 Cash -50 basis points 0.7 0.5 Variable borrowings including caps -50 basis points 1.4 1.5 ii Foreign exchange risk The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign exchange exposure.
However, it has operations in Europe which transact business denominated in euros and, to a lesser extent, in Swedish kronor.
Consequently, there is currency exposure caused by translating into sterling the local trading performance and net assets for each financial period and balance sheet, respectively.
The policy of the Group is to match the currency of investments with the related borrowing, which largely eliminates foreign exchange risk on property investments.
A portion of the remaining operations, equating to the net assets of the foreign property operations, is not hedged except in exceptional circumstances, such as the uncertainty surrounding the euro in late 2011.
Where foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, the Group will hedge the future committed commercial transaction using foreign exchange swaps or forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups principal currency exposures are in respect of the euro and the Swedish krona.
If the value of sterling were to increase or decrease in strength the Groups net assets and profit for the year would be affected.
The impact of a 1% increase or decrease in the strength of sterling against these currencies is set out below: 2017 2017 2016 2016 Net Profit Net Profit assets before tax assets before tax Scenario m m m m 1% increase in value of sterling against the euro 3.6 0.8 2.0 0.4 1% increase in value of sterling against the Swedish krona 0.4 0.4 0.1 1% fall in value of sterling against the euro 3.6 0.8 2.0 0.4 1% fall in value of sterling against the Swedish krona 0.4 0.4 0.1 iii Other price risk The Group is exposed to corporate bond price risk and, to a lesser extent, to equity securities price risk, because of investments held by the Group and classified in the balance sheet as available-for-sale.
In order to manage the risk in relation to the holdings of corporate bonds and equity securities the Group holds a diversified portfolio.
Diversification of the portfolio is managed in accordance with the limits set by the Group.

Credit risk arises from the ability of customers to meet outstanding receivables and future lease commitments, and from financial institutions with which the Group places cash and cash equivalents, and enters into derivative financial instruments.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is partly represented by the carrying amounts of the financial assets which are carried inthe balance sheet, including derivatives with positive fair values.
For credit exposure other than to occupiers, the Directors believe that counterparty risk is minimised to the fullest extent possible as the Group has policies which limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that rental contracts are made with customers with an appropriate credit history.
Credit risk to customers is assessed by a process of internal and external credit review, and is reduced by obtaining bank guarantees from the customer or its parent, and rental deposits.
The overall credit risk in relation to customers is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Moreover, a significant proportion of the Group portfolio is let to Government occupiers which can be considered financially secure.
At 31 December 2017 the Group held 121.8 million 2016: 116.4 million of available-for-sale financial assets.
Management considers the credit risk associated with individual transactions and monitors the risk on a continuing basis.
Information is gathered from external credit rating agencies and other market sources to allow management to react to any perceived change in the underlying credit risk of the instruments in which the Group invests.
This allows the Group to minimise its creditexposure to such items and at the same time to maximise returns for shareholders.
The table below shows the external Standard & Poors credit banding on the available-for-sale financial investments held bythe Group: 2017 2016 S&P Credit rating at balance sheet date m m Investment grade 6.7 6.8 Non-investment grade 52.7 43.7 Not rated 62.4 65.9 Total 121.8 116.4 c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk management requires maintaining sufficient cash, other liquid assets and the availability of funding to meet short, medium and long-term requirements.
The Group maintains adequate levels of liquid assets to fund operations and to allow theGroup to react quickly to potential opportunities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity on the basis of expected cash flows so that future requirements can be managed effectively.
The majority of the Groups debt is arranged on an asset-specific, non-recourse basis.
This allows the Group a higher degree offlexibility in dealing with potential covenant defaults than if the debt was arranged under a Group-wide borrowing facility.
115 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued 31 December 2017 23 Financial instruments continued Loan covenant compliance is closely monitored by the treasury department.
Potential covenant breaches can ordinarily be avoided by placing additional security or a cash deposit with the lender, or by partial repayment to cure an event of default.
