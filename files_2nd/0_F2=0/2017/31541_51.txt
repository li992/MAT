NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 November 2017 continued 19.
Pensions The Group operates a UK-based pension scheme, the St. Modwen Pension Scheme, with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and, from 1 September 2009, future accrual.
The Group income statement includes the following charges: 2017 2016 m m Defined benefit section 0.2 0.3 Defined contribution section 0.9 0.8 The St. Modwen Pension Scheme is governed by the trustee company, St. Modwen Pensions Limited.
It is regulated by the UK regulatory regime, overseen by the Pensions Regulator.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2014, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 38m and the funding level was 97% based on the Trustees proposed assumptions for technical provisions.
The main actuarial assumptions were: % per annum Investment rate of return pre-retirement : 5.6 Investment rate of return post-retirement : 3.8 Increase in pensions 2.7 The formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as of 5 April 2017 has not been completed at the date of signing these financial statements.
Funding policy As the scheme is almost fully funded, the current schedule of contributions requires the Group to fund the Scheme to such an extent as to cover administrative expenses only.
The contribution for the year ended 30 November 2018 is expected to be nil, consistent with the current year contributions of nil.
From 1 January 2015 the administrative expenses have been met by St. Modwen Properties PLC.
The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30 November 2017 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation was performed using the Projected Unit Credit Method under IAS 19.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2017 2016 % % Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.30 2.40 Rate of increase in pensions in payment pre 6 April 1997 benefits 2.55 2.55 Rate of increase in pensions in payment post 5 April 1997 benefits 3.20 3.30 Discount rate 2.60 2.80 Inflation assumption 2.30 2.40 Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is no longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31 August 2009.
Benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
From 2010 the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index.
The mortality rates adopted are from 85% of the S2PxA tables with CMI 2016 core model previously the VITA Tables with CMI 2013 core projections and a long-term improvement of 1.25% per annum previously 1% per annum with peaked short-term improvements and improvements remaining level at the oldest ages.
The resultant assumptions are, for example: Average future life expectancy in years for a pensioner aged 65 at 30 November 2017: 23.4 male and 25.2 female.
Average future life expectancy in years at age 65 for a non-pensioner aged 40 at 30 November 2017: 25.2 male and 27.1 female.

If the assets within the scheme deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate this will create or increase a deficit within the scheme.
This risk is reduced by holding a significant proportion of the scheme assets in matching assets bonds or similar.
As the scheme matures, it is anticipated that this proportion will increase to better match the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields will typically increase liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an appreciation in the value of scheme assets held in bonds.
Inflation risk As the pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities.
The asset portfolio includes a significant proportion of inflation linked bonds to reduce this risk.
Member longevity The pension obligations provide benefits for the life of the members, therefore increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in liabilities and vice-versa.
Sensitivity analysis Change in assumptions compared with 30 November 2017 actuarial assumptions: A 0.5% decrease in the discount rate would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 2.1m to 30.9m.
A one-year increase in life expectancy would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.4m to 30.2m.
A 0.5% increase in the inflation rate would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.4m to 30.2m.
A 0.5% increase in the rate of increase in deferred pensions would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 0.2m to 29.0m.
A 0.5% increase in the rate of increase in pensions in payments would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.2m to 30.0m.
