Introduction The EPRA Best Practices Recommendations EPRA BPR were issued by EPRAs Reporting and Accounting Committee in August 2011 and the guidance was subsequently updated in November 2016.
Included within EPRA BPR are six EPRA performance measures deemed to be of key importance to investors in property companies and which aim to encourage more consistent and widespread disclosure.
The EPRA performance measures are set out below: Performance measure Definition 1 EPRA Earnings Recurring earnings from core operational activities.
This is a key measure of a companys underlying operating results providing an indication of the extent to which current dividend payments are supported by earnings.
2 EPRA NAV Net asset value adjusted to include properties and other investment interests at fair value and to exclude certain items not expected to crystallise in a long-term property business model.
This measure is consistent with NAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 to the Group financial statements.
3 EPRA NNNAV EPRA NAV adjusted to include the fair values of i financial instruments, ii debt and iii deferred taxes.
This measure is consistent with NNNAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 to the Group financial statements.
4i EPRA Net Initial Yield NIY Annualised rental income based on cash rents at the balance sheet date, less non-recoverable property expenses, divided by the market value of the property, increased with estimated purchasers costs.
4ii EPRA topped-up yield This measure incorporates an adjustment to EPRA NIY in respect of the expiration of rent free periods or other unexpired lease incentives such as discounted rent periods and step rents.
5 EPRA Vacancy Rate Estimated Market Rent Value ERV of vacant space divided by ERV of the whole portfolio.
6 EPRA Cost Ratios This measure includes all administrative and operating expenses including share of joint ventures overheads and operating expenses, net of any service fees, all divided by gross rental income.
Grainger is supportive of EPRAs initiative and, in this report, is disclosing against five of the EPRA measures: EPRA Earnings, EPRA NAV, EPRA NNNAV, EPRA NIY and EPRA Vacancy Rate.
EPRA topped-up NIY is not appropriate to Graingers business.
The EPRA Cost Ratios, too, is less relevant to Grainger as it is distorted by the fact that in the reversionary portfolio rental levels are at a sub-market level.
In relation to EPRA NIY and EPRA Vacancy Rate, the figures shown are in respect of the Grainger wholly-owned market rented assets only.
Not included in these numbers are Graingers wholly-owned reversionary assets or any assets within joint ventures or associates.
The numbers presented in the tables below for EPRA Earnings, EPRA Earnings per share, EPRA NIY and EPRA Vacancy Rate relate to continuing operations only.
The EPRA measures being reported and the calculation of EPRA Earnings, EPRA NAV, EPRA NNNAV and EPRA NIY are set out below: 2017 2016 EPRA Earnings 57.6m 41.8m EPRA Earnings per share 14.0p 10.1p EPRA NAV 1,434.5m 1,379.5m EPRA NAV per share 343p 330p EPRA NNNAV 1,268.2m 1,199.5m EPRA NNNAV per share 303p 287p EPRA Net Initial Yield NIY 3.8% 4.3% EPRA Vacancy Rate 3.4% 2.1% Excludes property that is vacant and is being marketed for sale.

Therefore, it is not appropriate to show any measure of earnings that excludes profit on sale of trading property and so no adjustment has been made for this in the table above.
The adjustment made under this heading in both years relates to an impairment provision made against trading stock.

The adjustment to add the value of the Groups own shares is recognised as these shares do have a market value and this has been the historical basis of the Groups calculation.
In addition, the number of shares used in the NAV calculation is the total number of shares in issue including those held by the Company in treasury or trust for the purposes of settling future share awards.
This should be a close representation of the fully diluted number of shares and so is very unlikely to produce materially different NAV measures.
