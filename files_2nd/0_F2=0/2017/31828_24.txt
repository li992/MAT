Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 July 2017 1 Accounting policies 1.1 Corporate information The financial statements of Softcat plc for the year ended 31 July 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 18 October 2017.
Softcat plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and whose shares are publicly traded.
The registered office is Solar House, Fieldhouse Lane, Marlow, Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom.
The principal activity of the Company continued to be that of a value-added IT reseller and IT infrastructure solutions provider to the corporate and public sector markets.
1.2 Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued bythe International Accounting Standards Board IASB and as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are presented in the Companys presentational and functional currency of Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000, except when otherwise stated.
The Company applied all standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that were effective as of 31 July 2017.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Going concern The financial information has been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
At the date of approving the financial statements, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances that could lead to the Company being unable to settle commitments as they fall due during the twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
1.3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty When applying the Companys accounting policies, management must make a number of key judgements involving estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
These estimates and judgements are based on factors considered to be relevant, including historical experience that may differ significantly from the actual outcome.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include: Revenue cut-off The Companys management information systems are configured to recognise revenue upon notification of dispatch from the supplier or distributor which in instances, especially regarding physical shipments, may not be aligned to when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Under IFRS the point of recognition on physical shipments should be aligned to thedate of delivery, not dispatch.
Management therefore performs an exercise to capture items that may have been dispatched from distributor but not delivered in the financial year, and subsequently defers the recognition of revenue into the following year.
The exercise applied includes several assumptions, which management believes are reasonable, in order to identify items that fitthe criteria for deferral.
Separately, management reviews individual large deals on a case-by-case basis, which reduces the opportunity for error.
1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, see below IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 2 Amendments Share-based Payments IAS 7 Amendments Statement of Cash Flows IFRS 16 Leases, see below IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 76 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued 1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards continued The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Company, except for: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
Either a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Company is in the process of analysing the impact of IFRS 15 on its reporting.
This analysis has identified some discrete areas in which adjustments may be required to reporting under the principal versus agent assessment.
This change is driven by the application of the control principle, where the business would need to establish control of goods, whether hardware, software or services, prior to delivery to the customer.
Application of the control principle and guidance in IFRS 15 may have an impact on the classification of principal versus agent which could result in the Company recognising certain revenue as net.
Management is still to formally conclude this treatment.
The Companys IFRS 15 impact assessment and implementation work remains ongoing, alongside a quantification exercise which is expected to be finalised during the year ending 31 July 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 specifies how to recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with the exception of those with a lease term of less than twelve months or where the underlying asset has a low value.
The Company is assessing the impact of this standard, which is effective from periods beginning 1 January 2019.
1.5 Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes and duty.
The Company assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent.
The following specific recognition criteria must also bemet before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods The Company sells hardware and software that is sourced from and delivered by a number of suppliers.
Revenue from the sale of these goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.
The Company has primary responsibility for the acceptability of goods sold, is exposed to inventory risk during the delivery period, establishes the selling price itself and bears the customers credit risk.
It is therefore considered to be acting as principal in these sales and revenue is measured using the price charged to the customer, excluding sales tax.
Provision of services The Company also provides datacentre, cloud and software services.
Revenue in respect of these services is recognised when theservice has been satisfactorily completed or in line with the stage of completed work.
It is measured at either the sales prices, excluding sales taxes, or by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract.
In addition, the Company sells services provided by third parties.
Revenue for services provided by third parties is recognised atthe point of sale to the customer, as the Company has no ongoing obligations.
The Company establishes the selling price andisexposed to customer credit risk on this revenue and therefore considers itself to be acting as principal, measuring revenueas the price charged to the customer, excluding sales tax.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate EIR applicable.
EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life ofthefinancial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
Interest income is included in finance income in the income statement.
Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 77 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 July 2017 1 Accounting policies continued 1.6 Cost of sales The Company recognises cost of sales at the point at which it recognises revenue as explained above except for contracts which are recognised on a cost of completion percentage methodology.
Cost of sales predominantly relates to the cost of goods and services purchased from suppliers and then sold to customers.
In addition to these costs, the following elements are also included within cost of sales: Rebates Included within cost of sales are rebates received from commercial partners.
Further details are provided on rebates in 1.7, below.
Managed service infrastructure costs The Company operates its own network operating centre which facilitates the selling of Softcat hosted managed services.
Thecosts of maintaining this ability include, but are not limited to, the rental of space in data warehouses, energy and licensing costs.
These costs represent the cost of sale of selling hosted managed service solutions and are included within cost of sales.
Marketing costs and related credits The Company carries out numerous training programmes, activities and schemes that aim to educate its sales force and internally promote the products the business resells.
These activities are often funded by the Companys partners.
Both the cost of the programmes borne by the Company and the credits received, where applicable, are included within cost of sales.
Settlement discounts Through the normal course of business, the Company receives credits from distributors and suppliers for the prompt settlement ofinvoices.
Softcat recognises these discounts in cost of sales as they are considered to be a reduction in the cost of goods sold.
1.7 Rebates Rebates from suppliers are accounted for in the period in which they are earned and are based on commercial agreements with suppliers.
Rebates earned are mainly sales volume related and are generally short term in nature, with rebates earned but not yet received typically relating to the preceding quarters trading.
Rebate income is recognised in cost of sales in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income and rebates earned but not yet received are included within accrued income in the Statement of Financial Position.
1.8 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment other than freehold land is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and or impairment losses, if any.
If the costs of certain components of an item of property, plant and equipment are significant in relation to the total cost of the item, they are accounted for and depreciated separately.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Building improvements remaining period of lease ten years straight line Computer equipment threefive years straight line Fixtures, fittings and equipment six years straight line Motor vehicles three years straight line Land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and thecarrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
Building improvements relate to expenditure on improving both leasehold property and the freehold property of Solar House in Marlow.
Improvements to Solar House are depreciated over a ten-year period, which represents their useful life.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over their useful life which is the lesser of the remaining length of the lease or ten years.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for reasonableness at each financial year end and adjusted for prospectively if appropriate.
78 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued 1.9 Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Amortisation is provided for at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: Computer software threefive years straight line The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
1.10 Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Onerous property leases are provided for in the Statement of Financial Position and represent the present value of the onerous element of an operating lease.
This arises when the Company ceases to use premises and they are left vacant to the end of the lease.
At inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease.
At inception or on reassessment of the arrangement that contains a lease, the Company separates payments and other consideration required by suchan arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values.
1.11 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell.
Inventories are predominantly goods in transit and items for which a customer purchase order has been received but the goods have yet to be delivered to the customer.
1.12 Financial instruments Financial assets The Companys financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
All financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
Trade receivables do not carry interest.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in administrative expenses.
ii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, call deposits and bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
i Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value.
Trade payables due after one year are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
1.13 Pensions The pension costs charged in the financial statements represent the contributions payable by the Company during the year on the defined contribution pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The amounts charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable to the scheme in respect ofthe accounting period and represent the full extent of the Companys liability.
Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 79 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 July 2017 1 Accounting policies continued 1.14 Deferred taxation Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities inthe financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxassets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxprofit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
1.15 Current taxation Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income.
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
1.16 Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
All differences are taken to the income statement.
1.17 Share-based payments During the year the Company operated the following equity-settled share option schemes: Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP provides share options for nominated employees.
The purchase price is set at a mid-market price on the date of grant.
The CSOP operates both approved and unapproved schemes with vesting dependent on continued employment with the Company.
Options typically vest between one and three years and lapse after ten years from the date of grant.
The fair value of the CSOP options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and is charged as an expense inthe income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The Company operates an SIP for employees who were awarded free shares following the initial public offering in November 2015.
Shares were allocated to employees on the basis of length of service.
Free shares awarded to an employee under the SIP are subject to a holding period ending not earlier than the third anniversary and not later than the fifth anniversary of the date on which beneficial interest in the relevant ordinary shares is conferred by the SIP Trustee to the employee.
The fair value of the SIP shares is determined by the share price at date of grant, on 9 December 2015, and the number of shares expected to be transferred following the three-year vesting period.
The assumption used for expected leavers within three years from the date of award has been calculated with reference to historical employee retention rates.
The resulting fair value charge ischarged as an expense in the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The Companys voluntary partnership share purchase programme, which is open to all employees is administered through the SIP.
80 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued 1.17 Share-based payments continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Details in relation to the Softcat Long Term Incentive Plan 2016 awards to Executive Directors are included in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 49.
The awards will only vest and become exercisable upon achievement of performance targets, linked to earnings per share and total shareholder return, as well as being conditional upon continued employment with the Company.
The fair value is measured using a suitable valuation model where appropriate.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of LTIP shares expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of LTIP shares that will eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value ofthe LTIP shares granted.
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
The resulting fair value charge is charged as an expense in the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
Employee Benefit Trust and SIP Trust The Company operates an Employee Benefit Trust and an SIP Trust for the benefit of eligible employees.
The Company recognises the assets and liabilities of these trusts as its own until such assets held vest unconditionally with identified beneficiaries.
The Company meets all costs incurred by the trusts.
1.18 Company accounts Softcat plc is a single entity with no subsidiary undertakings.
The Employee Benefit and SIP Trusts, which hold shares on behalf ofemployees, are not consolidated within the results of Softcat plc and instead are treated as extensions of the Company.
1.19 Exceptional items Items that are material in size and unusual in nature are included within operating profit and disclosed separately in the income statement.
The separate reporting of these items helps to provide a more accurate indication of the underlying business performance.
2 Segmental information The information reported to the Companys Chief Executive, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance, is based wholly on the overall activities of the Company.
The Company has therefore determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is that of value-added IT reseller and IT infrastructure solutions provider.
The Companys revenue and results and assets for this one reportable segment can be determined by reference to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position.
An analysis of revenues by product, which form one reportable segment, is set out below: 2017 2016 Revenue by type: 000 000 Software 414,781 319,978 Hardware 287,424 250,692 Services 130,281 101,681 832,486 672,351 The total revenue for the Company for the year has been derived from its principal activity as an IT reseller.
Substantially all of this revenue relates to trading undertaken in the United Kingdom.

The primary purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Companys operations.
The Companys principal financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash that derive directly from its operations.
Financial assets The financial assets of the Company were as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Cash at bank and in hand 61,643 62,361 Trade and other receivables 173,506 132,787 235,149 195,148 The Directors consider that the carrying amount for all financial assets approximates to their fair value.

Financial risk management The Company is exposed to interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Companys senior management oversees the management of these risks and ensures that the Companys financial risk taking is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Company policies and Company risk appetite.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below: Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
At the year end the Company has no borrowings and therefore the exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the rates received as interest income on cash deposits.
The Company accepts the risk of losing interest on deposits due to interest rate reductions.
Due to the limited exposure to interest rate risk no sensitivity analysis has been prepared.
90 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 20 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Financial risk management continued Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk when dealing with customers and suppliers who wish to be billed in a currency other than Pounds Sterling.
As the vast majority of transactions are with UK customers and are denominated in Pounds Sterling, the Directors consider this foreign currency risk to be small and do not hedge this risk due to the limited exposure.
The level of foreign currency transactions is monitored closely to ensure that the level of exposure is manageable.
Due to the limited exposure to currency risk no sensitivity analysis has been prepared.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to afinancial loss.
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily for trade receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Trade receivables Credit risk from trade receivables is managed in accordance with the Companys established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management.
A customers credit quality is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.
At 31 July 2017, the Company had 1,013 accounts 2016: 871 that owed the Company more than 25,000 each.
These accounts accounted for approximately 14% 2016: 14% of total customers and 84% 2016: 82% of the total value of amounts receivable.
There were 297 customers 2016: 250 customers with balances greater than 100,000 accounting for just over 4% 2016: 4% of the total number of receivable accounts and 63% 2016: 58% of the total value of amounts receivable.
The requirement for impairment is analysed at each reporting date.
The calculation is based on actual incurred historical data.
Themaximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.
The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low as there islimited reliance on single, or a few, customers: instead, sales are typically small in size but large in volume as are the number ofcustomers.
This is illustrated by the fact that no more than 3% of receivables are due from any one customer at the year end.
Financial instruments and cash deposits Credit risk from cash balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with Company policy.
The Company hassignificant cash reserves which are accessible immediately and without restriction.
Credit risk with respect to cash deposits ismanaged by carefully selecting the institutions with which cash is deposited and spreading its deposits across more than one such institution to ease concentration risk.
Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 91 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 July 2017 20 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Company generates positive cash flows from operating activities and these fund short-term working capital requirements.
TheCompany aims to maintain significant cash reserves and none of its cash reserves are subject to restrictions.
Access to cash isnot restricted and could all be drawn upon immediately if so required.
The Board carefully monitors the levels of cash deposits and is comfortable that for normal operating requirements, no external borrowings are currently required.

At 31 July 2017, share options outstanding under the CSOP were as follows: No.

No CSOP options were granted in the year 2016: 500,000.
The fair value of CSOP options granted was calculated using the Black-Scholes model, incorporating relevant assumptions for weighted average share price, weighted average exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and share option term.
The resultant fair value was then spread over the relevant performance period for each tranche of share options.
2016 CSOP Share price 1.06 Weighted average exercise price at grant date 1.05 Expected dividend yield % 4.71 Risk-free interest rate % 0.50 Expected volatility % 40.00 Term 10 years During the year 200,000 FY16: 4,237,740 CSOP options were exercised with an average weighted share price at the date of exercise of 4.09 2016: 1.18.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding CSOP options is 8.07 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non transferability, restrictions and behavioural considerations at the date of granting the options.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the term commensurate with the expected term immediately prior to the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP provides share awards to Executive Directors and Senior Management.
Executive Directors Details in relation to the Softcat Long Term Incentive Plan 2016 awards to Executive Directors are included in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 49.
The awards will vest in 2019 upon achievement of certain performance targets and are conditional upon continued employment.
94 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 24 Share option schemes continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued Executive Directors continued During the year 295,896 2016: 350,000 share awards related to LTIP schemes were issued to two Executive Directors at nil exercise price with a performance period of three years.
The performance conditions on these awards include the Executive Directors continued employment at the date of vesting and satisfaction of the performance conditions which are linked to earnings per share and total shareholder return over the vesting period.
The EPS linked element of the LTIPs awarded in the year were valued using the Black-Scholes model and a Monte-Carlo simulation was used for the TSR linked element of the award.
The following assumptions were used: 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 EPS TSR EPS TSR Proportion of LTIP award 50% 50% 50% 50% Share price 2.97 2.97 3.20 3.20 Weighted average exercise price at grant date 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Risk-free interest rate 0.5% 0.5% 0.5% 0.5% Expected volatility 31% n a 26% n a Performance period years 3 3 3 3 Senior Management An award of 288,244 2016: nil shares was made to members of the Executive Leadership Team and other Senior Management in the year.
These shares had an exercise price of nil at the date of grant and a performance period of three years.
As the exercise price of the options awarded in the year was nil, fair value has been calculated by multiplying the number of share awards issued by the share price on the date of grant.
The resultant fair value is then recognised over the performance period.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of all LTIP awards is 8.98 years Share Incentive Plan SIP The Company operates a SIP for employees who were awarded free shares following the initial public offering in November 2015.
Historical employee attrition rates have been used to calculate the expected number of shares expected to vest.
The resulting income statement charge is spread over the three-year vesting period with a corresponding entry in equity.
No free shares were issued in the year under the SIP 2016: 629,883.
In total, 63,712 free shares were forfeited in the year.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of free shares is 1.36 years.
