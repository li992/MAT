2 The Group enters into derivatives with various counterparties which are governed by industry standard master netting agreements.
The Group holds and provides cash and securities collateral in respect of derivative transactions covered by these agreements.
The right to set off balances under these master netting agreements or to set off cash and securities collateral only arises in the event of non-payment or default and, as a result, these arrangements do not qualify for offsetting under IAS 32.
The effects of over collateralisation have not been taken into account in the above table.
