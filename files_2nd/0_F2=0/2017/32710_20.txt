Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a Basis of Preparation The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements on a going concern basis are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and interpretations by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the International Accounting Standards Board.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS may require management to make critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The estimates and associated assumptions about the future which are made by management relating to unlisted securities, are made using models generally recognised as standard within the industry and inputs are based on the historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Valuations use observable data to the extent practicable.
Changes in any assumptions could affect the reported fair value of the financial instruments.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Fund.
The Fund considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
st New standards, amendments and interpretations effective from 1 July 2016 No new standards were effective or adopted by the Fund during the year having an impact on the financial statements.

Early adoption of standards The Fund did not early adopt any new or amended standards interpretations for the year ended th 30 June 2017. b Financial Instruments Classification The Fund has designated all of its investments as at fair value through profit or loss.
This category comprises financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition and includes financial assets that are not held for trading purposes and which may be sold.
These investments are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the Funds documented investment strategy.
The investments of the Fund are principally in listed equities.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Fund includes in this category cash and cash equivalents, due from brokers and other short term receivables.
Other financial liabilities include all financial liabilities, other than those classified as held for trading.
The Fund includes in this category bank overdraft, due to brokers and other short term liabilities.
Recognition derecognition The Fund recognises a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Regular-way purchases and sales of investments are recognised on their trade date, the date on which the Fund commits to purchase or sell the investment.
Investments are derecognised when the rights to cash flows from the investments have expired or the Fund has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Fund derecognises a financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured initially at fair value being the transaction price.
Transaction costs incurred to acquire financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents, advisers, brokers and dealers.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which the arise.
com Genesis Emerging Markets Fund Limited | 57 Loans and receivables and financial liabilities are measured initially at their fair value plus any directly attributable incremental costs of acquisition or issue.
Fair value measurement Fair value is the amount by which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Securities listed on active markets are valued based on their last traded price for valuation and financial statement purposes.
Positions held in the affiliated investment company, Genesis Smaller Companies SICAV open-ended and listed but not traded, are valued at their fair value at the reporting end date.
In the normal course of business, the Fund utilises Participatory notes P Notes to gain access to markets that otherwise would not be allowable as a foreign investor.
P Notes are issued by banks or broker-dealers and allow the Fund to gain exposure to local shares in foreign markets.
They are valued based on the last price of the underlying equity at the valuation date.
The Funds investment in other funds Investee Funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective Investee Funds offering documentation.
The investments in Investee Funds are primarily valued based on the latest available redemption price for such units in each Investee Fund, as determined by the Investee Funds administrators.
The Fund reviews the details of the reported information obtained for the Investee Funds and considers the liquidity of the Investee Fund or its underlying investments, the value date of the net asset value provided, any restrictions on redemptions and the basis of the Investee Funds accounting.
If necessary, the Fund makes adjustments to the net asset value of the Investee Funds to obtain the best estimate of fair value.
Private placements are not registered for public sale and, excluding Genesis affiliated investment companies, are carried at an estimated fair value at the end of the year, as determined in good faith by the Valuation Committee of the Manager, in consultation with the Board of Directors of the Fund.
Factors considered in determining fair value will include a review of the most recent statement of financial position and operating results of the private placement and such other factors as may be relevant.
Private placements are classified either in Level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy, depending on whether they are valued based on observable or unobservable inputs.
For other investments held, where market prices are not readily available or if available market quotations are not reliable, securities are valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Committee of the Manager, using procedures approved by the Board of Directors.
In such circumstances the value of the security will be determined after considering factors such as cost, type of investment, subsequent trades by the Fund or other investors and other factors as may be relevant.
The Fund may make adjustments to the value of a security if it has been materially affected by events occurring before the Funds NAV calculation but after the close of the primary markets on which the security is traded.
The Fund may also make adjustment to the value of its investments if reliable market quotations are unavailable due to infrequent trading or if trading in a particular security was halted during the day and did not resume prior to the Funds NAV calculation.
Amortised cost measurement Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Financial liabilities, other than those classified at fair value through profit or loss, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the amortisation of these liabilities.

com c Foreign Currency Translation Functional and Presentation Currency The books and records of the Fund are maintained in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
The Directors have considered the primary economic environment of the Fund and considered the currency in which the original capital was raised, past distributions have been made and ultimately the currency in which capital would be returned on a break up basis.
The Directors have also considered the currency to which underlying investments are exposed.
On balance, the Directors believe that US dollars best represent the functional currency of the Fund.
The financial statements, results and financial position of the Fund are also expressed in US dollars which is the presentation currency of the Fund.
Transactions and Balances Transactions in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
At the end of each reporting period monetary items and non-monetary assets and liabilities that are fair valued and are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year.
Foreign exchange gains and losses relating to cash and cash equivalents are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within Net exchange gains or losses.
Foreign exchange gains and losses relating to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within Net change in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
d Recognition of Dividend and Interest Income Dividends arising on the Funds investments are accounted for on an ex-dividend basis, gross of applicable withholding taxes.
Deposit interest and interest on short-term paper is accrued on a dayto-day basis using the effective interest method.
Dividends and interest income are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
e Dividend Distribution Dividend distributions are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
A proposed dividend is recognised as a liability in the period in which it is approved at the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders and is recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
f Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash comprises current deposits with banks.
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible within three months to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes.
Bank overdrafts are accounted for as short term liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position and the interest expense is recorded using the effective interest rate method.
Bank overdrafts are classified as other financial liabilities.
g Due To and Due From Brokers Amounts due to brokers are payables for securities purchased that have been contracted for but not yet delivered on the statement of financial position date.
Amounts due from brokers include receivables for securities sold that have been contracted for but not yet delivered on the Statement of Financial Position date.
com Genesis Emerging Markets Fund Limited | 59 These amounts are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment for amounts due from brokers.
A provision for impairment of amounts due from brokers is established when there is objective evidence that the Fund will not be able to collect all amounts due from the relevant broker.
Significant financial difficulties of the broker, probability that the broker will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default in payments are considered indicators that the amount due from brokers is impaired.
h Segment Reporting Operating Segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting used by the chief operating decision maker CODM.
The CODM, who is responsible for allocation of resources and assisting performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Manager as it is responsible for investment decisions.
i Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
j Taxation The Fund currently incurs withholding taxes imposed by certain countries on investment income and capital gains taxes upon realisation of its investments.
Such income or gains are recorded gross of withholding taxes and capital gains taxes in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Withholding taxes and capital gains taxes are shown as separate items in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In accordance with IAS 12, Income taxes, the Fund is required to recognise a tax liability when it is probable that the tax laws of foreign countries require a tax liability to be assessed on the Funds capital gains sourced from such foreign country, assuming the relevant taxing authorities have full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances.
The tax liability is then measured at the amount expected to be paid to the relevant taxation authorities, using the tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
There is sometimes uncertainty about the way enacted tax law is applied to offshore investment funds.
This creates uncertainty about whether or not a tax liability will ultimately be paid by the Fund.
Therefore, when measuring any uncertain tax liabilities, management considers all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at the time that could influence the likelihood of payment, including any formal or informal practices of the relevant tax authorities.
k Share Capital Participating Preference Shares have no fixed redemption date and do not automatically participate in the net income of the Fund or accrue dividends and are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds net of tax.
l Purchase of Own Shares The cost of purchases of the Funds own shares is shown as a reduction in Shareholders Funds.
The Funds net asset value and return per Participating Preference Share are calculated using the number of shares outstanding after adjusting for purchases.

In some instances, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.

com Genesis Emerging Markets Fund Limited | 69 a Market Price Risk Market price risk is the risk that value of the instrument will experience unanticipated fluctuations as a result of changes in market prices other than those arising from foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer, or all factors influencing all instruments traded in the market.
Market price risk exposure The Fund invests predominantly in quoted equity securities, the fair value of which may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
All investments in securities present a risk of loss of capital, due to poor performance of the individual company, or a sharp deterioration in the sector, country, or regions economic environment.
The Fund also invests in securities and investments, including Investee Funds, that are not traded in active markets and are susceptible to market price risk from uncertainties about their future values of those securities and investments.
Market price risk management Market price risk can be moderated in a number of ways by the Manager through: i a disciplined stock selection and investment process: and ii limitation of exposure to a single investment through diversification and through amongst others, the implementation of investment restrictions.
The Board reviews the prices of the portfolios holdings and investment performance at their meetings.
The Funds portfolio at the end of reporting period reflects the diversified strategy.
The graphs and tables on Country and Sector Exposure of the Portfolio and composition of the Portfolio see pages 35 th to 45 illustrate the allocation of the portfolio assets according to these criteria as at 30 June 2017.
The Fund Manager has identified the MSCI EM TR Index as a relevant reference point for the markets in which it operates.
However, the Manager does not manage the Funds investment strategy to track the MSCI EM TR Index or any other index or benchmark.
The recent performance of the Fund and to the MSCI EM TR Index is shown in the Highlights and Performance section on pages 4 and 5 and is expected to change over time.
Given that the observed volatility of the Funds NAV in 2017 was 6.62% 2016: 19.58%, and assuming the same level of volatility in the coming year, the NAV and profit stands to increase or decrease by the amounts set out below: 2017 2016 $000 $000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 1,279,759 1,099,567 Net Asset Value impact 84,720 215,295 Market price risk Investee Funds The Funds investments in Investee Funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective Investee funds offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those Investee Funds.
The Manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying fund, its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying funds manager.
All of the Investee Funds in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective Investee Funds for their services.
Such compensation generally consists of an asset based fee and a performance based incentive fee and is reflected in the valuation of the Funds investment in each of the Investee Funds.

com The exposure to investments in Investee Funds at fair value is disclosed as part of Note 10.
These investments are included in Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in the Statement of Financial Position.
The Funds maximum exposure to loss from its interests in Investee Funds is equal to the total fair value of its investments in Investee Funds.
The Funds investment strategy entails trading in other funds on a regular basis.
There were no purchases th in Investee Funds during the year ended 30 June 2017 2016: none and total sales amounted to th $439,000 2016: 176,000.
As at 30 June 2017 and 2016 there were no capital commitment obligations th and no amounts due to Investee Funds for unsettled purchases.
During the year ended 30 June 2017 total net losses incurred on investments in Investee Funds were $548,000 2016: losses of $2,037,000.
b Foreign Currency Risk The Fund invests in financial instruments and enters into transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency.
Consequently, the Fund is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its functional currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse affect on the value of that portion of the Funds assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars functional currency.

The degree of sensitivity of the Funds assets to foreign currency risk depends on the net exposure of th the Fund to each specific currency and the volatility of that specific currency in the year.
At 30 June 2017, had the average exchange rate of the US dollar weakened by a reasonable possible movement of 500 basis points in relation to the basket of currencies in which the Funds net assets are denominated, weighted by the Funds exposure to each currency with all other variables held constant, the Fund estimates net assets and the change in net assets per the Statement of Comprehensive Income would have increased by $52,018,000 2016: $44,449,000.
An increase in the US dollar by 500 basis points in relation to the basket of currencies in which the Funds net assets are denominated would have resulted in a decline in net assets by the same amount but in the opposite direction, under the assumption that all other factors remain constant.
The Manager does not consider it realistic or useful to examine foreign currency risk in isolation.
The Manager considers the standard deviation of the NAV which is struck in US dollars as the appropriate risk measurement for the portfolio as a whole as it reflects market price risk generally.

com c Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk exposure Liquidity risk is the risk that the Fund will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations as they arise for settlement associated with financial liabilities or can do so on terms that are materially disadvantageous.
Liquidity risk also arises because the Funds assets may be invested in equities in emerging markets which may be less liquid than developing markets.
The Fund is closed-ended: therefore risk arising from redemption requests from investors does not exist.
Furthermore, the risk of the Fund not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given the large number of listed investments held in the portfolio and the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments.
th The liquidity risk profile of the Fund as at 30 June 2017 was as follows: 2017 2016 $000 $000 Amounts due within one month Amounts due to brokers 4,644 4,941 Payables and accrued expenses 2,055 1,878 Amounts due within one year Capital gains tax payable 1,038 141 Total liabilities 7,737 6,960 There were no amounts due beyond one year.
Liquidity risk management The restrictions on concentration and the diversification requirements detailed above see market price risk also serve normally to protect the overall value of the Fund from the risks created by the lower level of liquidity in the markets in which the Fund operates.
d Credit Risk Credit risk exposure Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment it has entered into with the Fund.
The Fund is exposed to counterparty credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from brokers.
The risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the credit quality of the custodians used by the Fund.
The Manager, on behalf of the Board, regularly reviews the brokers and Custodian used by the Fund, including their internal controls, in order to mitigate these risks.
th The Fund has no receivables past their due dates as at 30 June 2017 2016: nil.
Credit risk management All transactions in securities are settled upon delivery using brokers whose credit worthiness has been formally assessed as equivalent to investment grade or have been formally approved by the Investment Adviser.
The risk of default is mitigated by stringent processes in place by the relevant central depositories, together with broker and local agent adherence to market practices, which ensures that trades are able to settle in a timely and efficient manner.
Cash and cash equivalents are held by the Custodian and third party financial institutions whose credit ratings are assessed as equivalent to investment grade.
com Genesis Emerging Markets Fund Limited | 73 th The maximum exposure to credit risk before any credit enhancements a 30 June is the carrying amount of the financial assets as set out below.
2017 2016 Amounts due Amounts due within 1 year within 1 year $000 $000 Amounts due from brokers 4,636 4,261 Dividends receivable 2,295 4,001 Other receivable and prepayments 172 204 Cash and cash equivalents 35,059 20,245 42,162 28,711 None of these assets are impaired nor past due but not impaired.
Credit Risk Participatory Notes th As at 30 June 2017 the Fund held no P Notes 2016: the Fund held P Notes provided by Deutsche Bank and HSBC which allowed for the Fund to trade in equity securities in Saudi Arabia.
Investments in P Notes involve similar risks associated with a direct investment in the underlying foreign companies or foreign markets that they seek to replicate.
P Notes are not used for the purposes of hedging risk.
Although each P Note is structured with a defined maturity date, early redemption may be possible.
Other risks associated with P Notes include the possible failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement and potential delays or an inability to redeem before maturity under certain market conditions.
The Fund minimizes this risk by entering into agreements only with the counterparties that the Investment Advisor deems credit worthy.
Due to liquidity and transfer restrictions, the secondary markets on which the P Notes are traded may be less liquid than the markets for other securities, or may be completely liquid.
Credit Risk Securities Lending Participation in securities lending transactions exposes the Fund to risk of default by the third party borrower.
To mitigate this risk, the Lending Agent is responsible for monitoring the collateralisation of 102% and 105% and ensuring that these levels are maintained on marked to market fair values of all securities on loan.
In case of default by the borrower, the responsibility to make good the transaction falls to the Lending Agent.
The Investment Adviser actively monitors the capital levels and credit rating of the Lending Agent and the third party borrowers.
e Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
It arises on interest-bearing financial instruments recognised at the end of the reporting period.
74 | Genesis Emerging Markets Fund Limited www.
com Interest rate risk exposure and management The Fund has the ability to borrow up to 10% of the Funds NAV in order to increase the amount of capital available for investment.
The Fund aims to keep its use of an overdraft facility for trading purposes to a minimum only using a facility to enable settlements.
It may also hold interest bearing securities and cash.
Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and cash equivalents and interest payable on borrowing.
However, the Fund was not leveraged in 2017 or 2016.
The majority of the Funds net financial assets were non interest bearing 97.33% on average over the twelve-month th period to 30 June 2017 2016: 98.19%.
As a result, the Fund is not subject to significant amounts of risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates other than the impact such fluctuations may have on capital returns.
The Directors do not consider the exposure to interest risk as being material to the Fund.
f Capital Risk Management The capital of the Fund is represented by the equity attributable to holders of Participating Preference Shares.
The amount of equity attributable to holders of Participating Preference Shares is subject to change, at most, twice monthly as the Fund is a closed-ended fund with the ability to issue additional shares only if certain conditions are met as set out in the Funds scheme particulars.
The Funds objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Funds ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of the investment activities of the Fund.
Ultimate Controlling Party In the opinion of the Directors on the basis of the shareholdings advised to them, the Fund has no immediate or ultimate controlling party.
