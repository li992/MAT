a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative instruments.
b Significant accounting estimates and judgements The Directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
c Segmental reporting The Company is engaged in a single segment business and, therefore, no segmental reporting is provided.
d Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue return after taxation for the year is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. e Income Income from equity investments is accounted for on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
UK dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Overseas dividends are accounted for gross of any tax deducted at source.
Amounts are credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
Derivative instrument income received from dividends on long contracts for difference CFDs are accounted for on the date on which the right to receive or make the payment is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
The net amount is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Interest received on CFDs, bank deposits and money market funds is accounted for on an accruals basis and is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
f Management fees and other expenses Management fees and other expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
g Functional currency and foreign exchange The Directors, having regard to the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined its functional currency to be UK sterling.
UK sterling is also the currency in which the Financial Statements are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are reported in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement as a revenue or a capital item depending on the nature of the underlying item to which they relate.
h Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest paid on contracts for difference CFDs, which is accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method, and dividends paid on short CFDs, which are accounted for on the date on which the obligation to incur the cost is established, normally the ex-dividend date.

Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2017 43 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting Policies continued i Taxation The taxation charge represents the sum of current taxation and deferred taxation.
Current taxation is taxation suffered at source on overseas income less amounts recoverable under taxation treaties.
Taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except where it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where expenses are allocated between revenue and capital any tax relief in respect of the expenses is allocated between revenue and capital returns on the marginal basis using the Companys effective rate of corporation tax for the accounting period.
The Company is an approved Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and is not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting purposes and their treatment for the purposes of computing taxable profits.
Deferred taxation is based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted when the taxation is expected to be payable or recoverable.
Deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to utilise them.
j Dividend paid Dividends payable to equity Shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.
k Investments The Companys business is investing in financial instruments with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of investments is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss, in accordance with the provisions of both Section 11 and Section 12 of FRS 102.
The fair value of investments is initially taken to be their cost and is subsequently measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, or last market prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, or otherwise, at fair value based on published price quotations.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains on investments in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed these costs in note 10. l Derivative instruments When appropriate, permitted transactions in derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include long and short CFDs and futures.
Derivatives are classified as other financial instruments and are initially accounted and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value as follows: Long and short CFDs the dierence between the strike price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract: Futures the dierence between contract price and the quoted trade price.
Where transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, the income and expenses derived are included in net income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the income and expenses derived are included in gains on derivative instruments in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected on the Balance Sheet at their fair value within current assets or creditors.
m Debtors Debtors include securities sold for future settlement, accrued income, taxation recoverable and other debtors incurred in the ordinary course of business.
If collection is expected in one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer they are classified as current assets.
If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
They are recognised initially at fair value and, where applicable, subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
n Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers These are amounts held in segregated accounts as collateral on behalf of brokers and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
o Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund The Company holds an investment in the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc, a short term money market fund investing in a diversified range of short term instruments.
The Fund is readily convertible to cash and is considered a cash equivalent.
p Other creditors Other creditors include investment management fees and other creditors and expenses accrued in the ordinary course of business.
If payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer they are classified as current liabilities.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2017 51 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Financial Instruments Management of risk The Companys investing activities in pursuit of its investment objective involve certain inherent risks.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Company.
The Board with the assistance of the Manager, has developed a risk matrix which, as part of the internal control process, identifies the risks that the Company faces.
Principal risks identified are market, performance, discount control, gearing and currency risks.
Other risks identified are tax and regulatory and operational risks, including those relating to third party service providers covering investment management, marketing and business development, company secretarial, fund administration and operations and support functions.
Risks are identified and graded in this process, together with steps taken in mitigation, and are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Risks identified are shown in the Strategic Report on pages 11 and 12.
This note refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise: Equity shares and bonds held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Derivative instruments which comprise CFDs and futures on equity indices: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations.
The risks identified arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and derivative instrument risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies are consistent with those followed last year.
Market price risk Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through its share capital and reserves.
In addition, the Company has gearing through the use of derivative instruments.
The level of gearing is reviewed by the Board and the Portfolio Manager.
The Company is exposed to a finacial risk arising as a result of any increases in interest rates associated with the funding of the derivative instruments.
Interest rate risk exposure The values of the Companys financial instruments that are exposed to movements in interest rates are shown below: 2017 2016 000 000 Exposure to financial instruments that earn interest Short CFDs exposure plus fair value 45,922 Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers 11,127 1,382 Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund 3,030 6,283 Cash at bank 4,128 4,003 64,207 11,668 Exposure to financial instruments that bear interest Long CFDs exposure less fair value 34,444 39,362 Net exposure to financial instruments that earn bear interest 29,763 27,694 Due to negative interest rates during the year, the Company has received interest on its long CFDs and paid interest on its short CFDs.
52 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2017 17 Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Companys net return on ordinary activities after taxation and its net assets can be affected by foreign exchange rate movements because the Company has income, assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currency which is UK sterling.
The Company can also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example, between the date when an investment is purchased or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in exchange rates aecting the value of investments and derivative instruments: Movements in exchange rates aecting short term timing dierences: and Movements in exchange rates aecting income received.
The portfolio management team monitor foreign currency risk but it is not the Companys current policy to hedge against currency risk.
Currency exposure of financial assets The currency exposure profile of the Companys financial assets is shown below: 2017 long exposure to investments derivative cash at 1 at fair value instruments debtors bank total currency 000 000 000 000 000 Danish krone 48,322 308 48,630 Euro 690,319 105,862 3,696 9 799,886 Norwegian krone 42,216 42,216 Swedish krona 8,172 8,172 Swiss franc 164,455 1,664 166,119 UK sterling 57,630 14,418 4,119 76,167 1,011,114 105,862 20,086 4,128 1,141,190 2016 long exposure to investments derivative cash at 1 at fair value instruments debtors bank total currency 000 000 000 000 000 Danish krone 38,709 162 38,871 Euro 564,407 38,785 2,235 32 605,459 Norwegian krone 31,898 31,898 Swedish krona 15,330 15,330 Swiss franc 158,897 772 159,669 UK sterling 53,506 8,053 3,971 65,530 862,747 38,785 11,222 4,003 916,757 1 Debtors include amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers and amounts invested in the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2017 53 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Financial Instruments continued Currency exposure of financial liabilities The Company finances its investment activities through its ordinary share capital and reserves.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise short positions on derivative instruments and other creditors.
The currency profile of these financial liabilities is shown below: 2017 short exposure to derivative other instruments creditors total currency 000 000 000 Euro 43,991 43,991 Swiss franc 4,999 4,999 UK sterling 2,357 2,357 48,990 2,357 51,347 2016 short exposure to derivative other instruments creditors total currency 000 000 000 UK sterling 2,044 2,044 Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Portfolio Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly due to the underlying exposures, are estimated using Value at Risk and Stress Tests as set out in the Companys internal Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities and derivative instruments which can be sold easily to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of bank overdraft, if required.
Liquidity risk exposure At 31 December 2017 the undiscounted gross cash outflows of the financial liabilities were all repayable within one year and consisted of derivative instrument liabilities of 6,575,000 2016: 577,000 and other creditors of 2,357,000 2016: 2,044,000.
Counterparty risk Certain of the derivative instruments in which the Company invests are not traded on an exchange but instead will be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swaps Dealers Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contract.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Manager employs, the Manager will seek to minimise such risk by only entering into transactions with counterparties which are believed to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance, and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk by the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and by evaluating derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
54 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2017 17 Financial Instruments continued For Over The Counter OTC derivative transactions, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.
At 31 December 2017, 3,825,000 2016: nil was held in cash, in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the Company, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the Company and 11,127,000 2016: 1,382,000 was held by the Company in cash, shown as amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers on the Balance Sheet, in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the broker, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the broker.
Credit risk Financial instruments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with brokers that have been approved by the Manager and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker and are kept under review by the Manager.
Exposure to credit risk arises on unsettled security transactions, derivative instrument contracts and cash at bank.
Derivative instruments risk The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments are set out in a documented Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
Derivative instruments are used by the Manager for the following purposes: To gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial ow of capital: To hedge equity market risk using derivatives with the intention of at least partially mitigating losses in the exposures of the Companys portfolio as a result of falls in the equity market: To position short exposures in the Companys portfolio.
These uncovered exposures benefit from falls in the prices of shares which the Portfolio Manager believes to be over valued.
These positions, therefore, distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial instruments held and interest rates at 31 December 2017, an increase of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables held constant, would have decreased the return on ordinary activities after taxation for the year and decreased the net assets of the Company by 74,000 2016: 69,000.

Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
As explained in Notes 2 k and l on page 44, investments and derivative instruments are shown at fair value.
In the case of cash and cash equivalents, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
Fair Value Hierarchy The Company is required to disclose the fair value hierarchy that classifies its financial instruments measured at fair value at one of three levels, according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values.
Classication Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1.
Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
