Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Legal & General Group Plc 2017 Independent auditors report to the members of Legal & General Group Plc Report on the audit of the financial statements Opinion In our opinion: Legal & General Group Plcs group financial statements and company financial statements the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the groups and of the companys affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the groups profit and cash flows for the year then ended: the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union: the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, and applicable law : and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts the Annual Report, which comprise: the group and parent company balance sheets as at 31 December 2017, the group income statement and statement of comprehensive income, the group cash flow statement, and the group and parent company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended: and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs UK are further described in the Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRCs Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that nonaudit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the company.
Other than those disclosed in note 34 to the financial statements, we have provided no nonaudit services to the group or the company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach Overview Overall group materiality: 102.75 million 2016: 70 million, based on 5% of operating profit before tax.
"Overall company materiality: 27.75 million 2016: 27.75 million, based on 1% of total assets, capped at 27.75 million, to reflect its allocation of materiality for the purpose of the Group audit Based on the outputs of our risk assessment, along with our understanding of the Legal & General structure, we performed full scope audits of components which, using our professional judgement, we considered significant within the following segments: Legal & General Retirement LGR, Legal & General Investment Management LGIM, Legal & General Insurance ""LGI"", General Insurance GI and the former Savings segment which is now classified as discontinued operations."

The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the industries in which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.
We designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the group and company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, the Prudential Regulation Authoritys regulations, the Pensions Regulator legislation, the UK tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant component teams.
Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with the regulators, enquiries of management, review of significant components auditors' work and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of non-participating insurance contract Liabilities Retirement Refer to the Audit Committee Report and note 1 to the financial statements for the directors disclosures of the basis of preparation and use of estimates and notes 19, 20 and 21 for related accounting policies and further information on judgements and estimates.
We focused on this area because the provision for the settlement of future claims for retirement products is significant in size and its estimation involves complex and subjective judgements about future events, both internal and external to the business, for which small changes in assumptions can materially impact the valuation of these liabilities.
Key assumption areas are: Valuation interest rate the discount rate derived from the yield on the assets backing the annuity liabilities used in calculating the present value of annuity and benefit payments.
The discount rate also includes an explicit allowance for future credit default and reinvestment risk on the asset portfolio: and Longevity how long the policyholders receiving annuity payments are expected to live and how that might change over time.
Our audit effort covered these key assumptions.
We focused a greater amount of effort where either of the assumptions changed in the period or where we considered, based on the annual analysis of longevity and credit default, that the assumptions or methodology needed to be reconsidered.
Valuation interest rate We understood and tested the Groups processes and controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data used in The financial results of the Group can be very sensitive to determining the valuation interest rate.

This is a continued area of focus as Management invest in a wider range of asset classes.
Model changes leading to calculation error Changes to the actuarial process or model to calculate the Valuation Interest Rate are not appropriate.
Management needs to continue to assess whether the methodology remains appropriate.

Valuation of complex investments Refer to the Audit Committee Report and note 1 to the financial statements for the directors disclosures of the basis of preparation and use of estimates and note 12 for related accounting policies and further information on judgements and estimates for investment risks.
The groups financial investments enable it to support its insurance liabilities and meet regulatory capital requirements, as well as providing returns on shareholder assets the assets available for distribution to shareholders after taking account of policyholder liabilities, including associated guarantees, options and bonuses.
Most of the groups financial investments are valued by reference to prices on active markets.
However, some are priced by reference to market data and or valuation models.
They vary in complexity depending on the nature of the investments.
Investments that are complex to value and require the use of significant judgement include: Lifetime Mortgages: Commercial Loans: and Private Credit Valuation of complex investments We have obtained all agreements for commercial loans and Private Credit.

We reviewed the methodology adopted by Markit and understood and validated the appropriateness of the methodology adopted.
We have also assessed the appropriateness of the key input assumptions including referencing them to external sources where relevant.
We have reviewed the methodology used to value Lifetime Mortgages against IAS 39.
We have also reviewed the appropriateness of the assumptions used to value the assets in light of market conditions and other available information.
We have checked that the methodology has been correctly implemented in the Lifetime Mortgages valuation model.
We have tested the input of assumptions and data into the valuation model.
We have tested the accuracy of the data on which the valuation is based back to policyholder documentation.
We did not identify any material exceptions in our testing.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
Using the outputs of a risk assessment, along with our understanding of the group, we scoped our audit based on the significance of the results and financial position of individual markets relative to the group result and financial position.
In doing so, we considered qualitative factors and ensured that we obtained sufficient coverage across all financial statement line items in the consolidated financial statements.
We determined the type of work that needed to be performed for each component by us as the group engagement team, component audit teams within PwC UK and from other PwC network firms under our instructions.
The group reports in five reportable segments: LGR, LGIM, LGC, LGI and GI.
Based on the outputs of our risk assessment, along with our understanding of the L&G structure, we performed full scope audits of components which, using our professional judgement, we considered significant within the following segments: LGR, LGIM, LGI and GI.
Additionally, we performed work over the former Savings segment which is now classified as discontinued operations.
Where work was performed by auditors of the components, we determined the level of involvement we needed as the group audit team to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
The group audit team kept in regular communication with component audit teams through onsite visits, regular phone calls, discussions and written instructions, where appropriate.
We tailored the scope of the company audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to enable us to give an opinion on the company financial statements.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Group financial statements Company financial statements Overall materiality 102.75 million 2016: 70 million.
How we determined it 5% of operating profit before tax.
1% of total assets, capped at 27.75 million, to 114 Group financial statements Company financial statements reflect its allocation of materiality for the purpose of the Group audit Rationale for benchmark The engagement team concluded that 102.75 Given the principal activities of the company applied million is the most appropriate figure when and the presentation of only the balance sheet setting an overall materiality on the 2017 and related notes in the group accounts we have engagement.
This represents 5% of 2017 concluded that it is appropriate to apply a operating profit.
The engagement team believes balance sheet related benchmark in determining that operating profit is the most suitable metric the appropriate level of materiality.
to use as a benchmark - operating profit represents the pre-tax result using a smoothed longer term investment return.
Any variance between actual and smoothed investment return is reported below the line.
This variance can fluctuate year on year and from segment to segment.
This reason coupled with the fact that operating profit is a key metric for Legal & General and is used by analysts to assess profitability leads the engagement team to consider that operating profit is a more suitable benchmark for calculating materiality than IFRS profit before tax.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was 13 million - 80 million.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 5.1 million Group audit 2016: 3.5 million and 1.35 million Company audit 2016: 1.35 million as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern In accordance with ISAs UK we report as follows: Reporting obligation Outcome We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in We have nothing material to add or to respect of the directors statement in the financial statements about whether the directors draw attention to.
However, because considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the not all future events or conditions can financial statements and the directors identification of any material uncertainties to the be predicted, this statement is not a groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least guarantee as to the groups and twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
companys ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors statement relating to Going Concern in We have nothing to report.
6R 3 is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
115 Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, CA06, ISAs UK and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below required by ISAs UK unless otherwise stated.
Strategic Report and Directors Report In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
CA06 In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors Report.
CA06 Corporate Governance Statement In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 62 to 67 about internal controls and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures in compliance with rules 7.2.
6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the FCA DTR is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
CA06 In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in this information.
CA06 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 62 to 67 with respect to the companys corporate governance code and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.
CA06 We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the company.
CA06 The directors assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding: The directors confirmation on page 52 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
The directors explanation on page 51 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group.
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors process supporting their statements: checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code : and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.
Listing Rules Other Code Provisions We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: The statement given by the directors, on page 254 that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the groups and companys position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
The section of the Annual Report on page 63-65 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
The directors statement relating to the companys compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors Remuneration In our opinion, the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
CA06 116 Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of directors responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Following a review of certain short dated instruments held by the group, certain assets have been reclassified from Cash and cash equivalents to Financial investments as their tenure is greater than 3 months.
There is a net nil impact on the Consolidated Income Statement.
The reclassification has resulted in an adjustment to the Investments held for trading or designated as fair value through profit or loss in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement of 1,847m at 2016.
Tax comprises UK corporation tax paid of 290m 2016: 249m, overseas corporate taxes of 12m 2016: 16m, and withholding tax of 195m 2016: 159m.
Net cash flows from acquisitions includes cash paid of 64m 2016: nil less cash and cash equivalents received of 1m 2016: nil.
Net cash flows from disposals includes cash received of 286m 2016: 144m less cash and cash equivalents disposed of nil 2016: 416m.

124 Primary Statements and Performance continued 1 Basis of preparation Legal & General Group Plc, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom UK, transacts life assurance and longterm savings business, investment management and general insurance and health business through its subsidiaries and associates in the UK, the United States and other countries throughout the world.
Significant accounting policies The group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The group financial statements also comply with IFRS and interpretations by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the European Union.
The group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
Accounting policies that relate specifically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis.
Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or IFRIC interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the group.
New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the group The group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2017.
Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative The amendments require entities to provide disclosure of changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes such as foreign exchange gains or losses.
The group has provided this information in Note 24.
Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses The amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits against which it may make deductions on the reversal of deductible temporary difference related to unrealised losses.
They also provide guidance on how an entity should determine future taxable profits and explain the circumstances in which taxable profit may include the recovery of some assets for more than their carrying amount.
The amendments did not affect the current or prior period results.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The amendments clarify that the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12, other than those in paragraphs B10B16, apply to an entitys interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate or a portion of its interest in a joint venture or an associate that is classified or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale.
The group concluded that there is no additional information that it needs to disclose as a result of these amendments.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective Certain standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published which are mandatory for the groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 or later periods but which the group has not adopted early, as disclosed below.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued in May 2014, is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and supersedes all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
The standard provides clear guidance over when and how much revenue should be recognised, by introducing a principles-based recognition approach based on the concept of recognising revenue for obligations as they are satisfied.
As the standard does not apply to business classified as insurance contracts, the main impact of IFRS 15 is expected to be on the accounting for revenue from investment management business.
The group does not expect the impact to be significant.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 subject to EU endorsement.
The standard will be applied retrospectively, subject to the transitional options provided for in the standard, and provides a comprehensive approach for accounting for insurance contracts including their valuation, income statement presentation and disclosure.
The group has mobilised a project to assess the financial and operational implications of the standard and work will continue throughout 2018 to ensure technical compliance and to develop the required system capability to implement the standard.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial Instruments which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The IASB subsequently issued Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts which allows entities which meet certain requirements to defer their implementation of IFRS 9 until adoption of IFRS 17 or 1 January 2021, whichever is the earlier.
As disclosed in the 31 December 2016 financial statements, the group will meet these requirements and it will therefore apply this deferral of IFRS 9.
The sale of the Mature Savings business, announced in 2017, is not expected to change this conclusion.
The impact of IFRS 9 on the groups financial statements will depend on the interaction of the asset classification and measurement with the insurance contract measurement at the date of transition, particularly for liabilities which are measured using locked-in discount rates.
125 Primary Statements and Performance continued 1 Basis of preparation continued Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective continued IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments was issued in June 2017 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
The Interpretation clarifies the application of recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle These improvements were issued in December 2017 and consist of minor amendments affecting IFRS 3 Business combinations, IFRS 11 Joint arrangements, IAS 12 Income taxes and IAS 23 Borrowing costs.
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits These amendments were issued in February 2018 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
The amendments require entities to use updated assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement: they also clarify how the requirements for accounting for a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement affect the asset ceiling requirements.
Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.
The Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements associated with and the application of significant accounting policies.
The significant accounting issues considered by the Audit Committee are included within the Audit Committee Report on page 72.
The major areas of judgement on policy application are considered below: Financial statement area Critical accounting judgement Note Insurance and investment contract Assessment of the significance of insurance risk transferred to the group in Notes 21 and 22 liabilities determining whether a contract should be accounted for as an insurance or investment contract.
Consolidation Assessment of whether the group controls underlying entities and should Notes 44-46 therefore consolidate them.
The assessment takes account of various criteria, including decision making ability, equity holding and the rights to a variable return from the entity.
The table below sets out those areas of the financial statements which are particularly susceptible to changes in estimates and assumptions: Financial statement area Critical accounting assumptions Note Valuation of insurance and Determination of longevity, mortality and morbidity assumptions used in Notes 19-22 investment contract liabilities the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities.
The assumptions for the rate of future longevity, mortality and morbidity are based on the groups internal experience and judgements about how experience may vary in the future.
This assessment takes into account market benchmarking, internal experience studies and independent industry data.
Determination of valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are sensitive to the assumptions made, for example, on credit default of the backing assets.
These assumptions take into account consideration of market experience and historic data internal data.
Valuation of unquoted illiquid assets Determination of fair value of unquoted and illiquid assets, and investment Notes 12 and 20 and investment property property involves judgements, as mark to model valuations, through the incorporation of both observable and unobservable market inputs, inherently include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of plausible valuation for financial assets.
Defined benefit pension plan Determination of pension plan assumptions including mortality, discount Note 25 rates and inflation.
These assumptions have been set in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 and include consistent judgements with those in setting the annuity liabilities where possible.
Note 25 includes a sensitivity analysis to alternative assumption.
Consolidation principles Subsidiary undertakings The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are those entities including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts over which the group directly or indirectly has control i. e. when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee Note 44.
Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
Puttable instruments held by external parties in consolidated investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Associates and joint ventures The group has interests in associates and joint ventures Note 45 which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity vehicles, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities.
In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, Investments in associates, these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Associates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost.
The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reflect the groups share of total comprehensive income after the date of the acquisition.
126 Primary Statements and Performance continued 1 Basis of preparation continued Product classification The groups products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance contracts participating and non-participating or investment contracts participating and non-participating.
The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 21 and 22 respectively.
Fiduciary activities Assets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements.
Where the group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.
Foreign exchange and exchange rates Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions.
The functional currency of the groups foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The assets and liabilities of all of the groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the groups presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders equity.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
The year end exchange rates at 31 December 2017 were 1.35 United States Dollar and 1.13 Euro 31 December 2016: 1.24 United States Dollar and 1.17 Euro.
The average exchange rates for year ended 31 December 2017 were 1.29 United States Dollar and 1.14 Euro 31 December 2016: 1.36 United States Dollar and 1.22 Euro.

The profit loss before tax reflects profit loss before tax attributable to equity holders.
Group debt costs exclude interest on non recourse financing.
During 2017, changes have been made to the organisational structure.
Investment Discounts On Line Limited the IDOL has been transferred to LGI from LGR.
Comparatives have been amended accordingly.
The impact of this reclassification has been to reduce LGR 2017 operating profit by 2m, and increase LGI UK and Other 2017 operating profit by 2m.
Discontinued operating profit from divisions primarily reflects the operating profit of the Savings division following the announcement in December 2017 to sell the Mature Savings business to Swiss Re.
For these operating profit disclosures, discontinued operations also includes the results of Legal & General Netherlands and Cofunds.
These businesses were sold during 2017 and were components of the LGI UK and Other and Savings divisions respectively.
Profit before tax attributable to equity holders in the Consolidated Income Statement of 1,991m excludes the profit before tax associated with discontinued operations of 99m, as this is included in the Profit after tax from discontinued operations of 80m.
This supplementary operating profit information one of the group's key performance indicators provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and the group believes it provides shareholders with a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year.
For LGR, worldwide pension risk transfer business including longevity insurance is within LGRI, and individual retirement and lifetime mortgages is within LGRR.
LGIM represents institutional and retail investment management and workplace savings businesses.
LGC represents shareholder assets invested in direct investments, and traded and treasury assets.
LGI represents business in retail and group protection written in the UK, networks, and protection business written in the US LGIA.
General Insurance comprises short-term household and other personal insurance.
Discontinued operations represent businesses that have either been sold or announced to sell in 2017, namely Mature Savings including with-profits, Legal & General Netherlands LGN sold in April 2017 and Cofunds sold in January 2017.
LGN and Cofunds were not classified as discontinued in 2016.
Operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes and exceptional items.
Operating profit therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the groups insurance businesses and shareholder funds, except for LGCs trading businesses which includes the IFRS profit before tax and LGA which excludes unrealised investment returns to align with the liability measurement under US GAAP.
Variances between actual and smoothed investment return assumptions are reported below operating profit.
Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition, and start-up costs, are also excluded from operating profit.
Sale of Mature Savings In December 2017, the group announced the sale of its Mature Savings business to the ReAssure division of Swiss Re Limited Swiss Re for 650m.
The sale is subject to regulatory approval and the Part VII transfer is planned to complete in 2019.
As a result of the announcement the assets and liabilities of the Mature Savings business are classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and its results are included within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Income Statement and any associated disclosures.
Release from operations includes dividends from the US of 80m within the LGIA line.
2. International and other includes 48m of restructuring costs 59m before tax within the group investment projects and expenses line.
The IDOL business has been transferred to LGI from LGR.
The impact of this transfer has been to reduce LGR 2016 release from operations by 1m and increase LGI UK and Other 2016 release from operations by 1m.
Workplace Savings represents administration business only.
Profits on fund management services are included within LGIM excluding Workplace Savings.
Discontinued operations primarily reflects the result from the Savings division following the announcement in December 2017 to sell the Mature Savings business to Swiss Re.
For this Reconciliation of release from operations to operating profit before tax disclosure, discontinued operations also includes the results of Legal & General Netherlands sold in April 2017 and Cofunds sold in January 2017.
These businesses were sold during 2017 and were previously reflected in the LGI UK and Other and Savings divisional results respectively.
Release from operations for LGR, LGIM and LGI represents the expected IFRS surplus generated in the year from the in-force non profit annuities, workplace savings and protection businesses using best estimate assumptions.
The LGIM release from operations also includes operating profit after tax from the institutional and retail investment management businesses.
The LGI release from operations also includes dividends remitted from LGIA and operating profit after tax from the remaining LGI businesses.
The release from operations within discontinued operations reflects the shareholders share of bonuses on with-profits business, operating profit after tax from the Mature Savings business, and dividends remitted from Legal & General Netherlands LGN.
New business surplus strain for LGR, LGIM and LGI represents the cost of acquiring new business and setting up prudent reserves in respect of the new business for UK non profit annuities, workplace savings and protection, net of tax.
The new business surplus and release from operations for LGR, LGIM and LGI excludes any capital held in excess of the prudent reserves from the liability calculation.
Net release from operations for LGR, LGIM, LGI and discontinued operations is defined as release from operations plus less new business surplus strain.
Release from operations and net release from operations for LGC and General Insurance represents the operating profit net of tax.
See Note iii for more detail on experience variances, changes to valuation assumptions and non-cash items.
Release from operations includes US dividends of 63m within the LGIA line and dividends remitted from LGN of 70m within the discontinued operations line.
2. International and other includes 43m of restructuring costs 54m before tax within the group investment projects and expenses line.

The impact of this classification has been to reduce LGR 2016 release from operations by 1m and increase LGI 2016 release from operations by 1m.
Other experience variances for LGR includes the impact of an improvement in the quality of scheme data relating to bulk annuities.
Mortality assumption changes for LGR include a one-off longevity release of 274m in relation to an update of the portfolio base mortality assumptions as noted at H1 17, as well as the impact of moving trend assumptions from adjusted CMI 2014 to adjusted CMI 2015.
The LGI assumption change reflects the impact of actual experience as well as refinements in the treatment of insured persons with sub-standard health.

Subsequent to 31 December 2017, the directors proposed a final dividend for 2017 of 11.05 pence per ordinary share.
Subject to approval at the AGM, the dividend will be accounted for as an appropriation of retained earnings during the year ended 31 December 2018, and is not included as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
133 Primary Statements and Performance continued 5 Earnings per share Earnings per share is a measure of the portion of the group's profit allocated to each outstanding share.
It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares.
For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the company, derived from continuing operations.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.

135 Balance sheet management 7 Principal products A significant part of the groups business involves the acceptance and management of risk.
A description of the principal products offered by the groups segments is outlined below.
The group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the board.
The groups risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 48-53.
Details of the risks associated with the groups principal products and the control techniques used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 8 and 16 to 18.
Legal & General Retirement LGR Annuity contracts Annuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment.
No surrender value is available under any of these products.
Pension risk transfer PRT represents ulk annuities, whereby the group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund, are written predominantly to UK clients, but also for US, Dutch and Irish clients.
Immediate and deferred annuity contracts are also offered to individual policyholders.
Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase.
The income stream from a deferred annuity is delayed until a specified future date.
A small portfolio of immediate annuities has been written as participating business.
Some non-participating deferred annuities sold by the group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.
The value of such guaranteed options are currently immaterial.
There is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK non-profit business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases.
In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI, or for a minority CPI, becomes negative.
The total of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2017 was 640m 2016: 610m.
Thus, 1% negative inflation, which was reversed in the following year, would result in a guarantee cost of approximately 6m 2016: 6m.
Negative inflation sustained over a longer period would give rise to significantly greater guarantee costs.
Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative inflation hedges and limited price indexation swaps.
The group also offers products for individuals that provide a guaranteed level of income over a chosen fixed period of time, in exchange for an initial lump sum payment from the policyholder.
The products can provide a fixed lump sum at maturity and or options to surrender on nonguaranteed terms.
The group has written some deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum pensions.
These options expose the group to interest rate and longevity risk as the cost would be expected to increase with decreasing interest rates and improved longevity.
The market consistent value of these guarantees carried in the balance sheet is 220m at end December 2017 2016: 250m.
Longevity insurance contracts The group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reflecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return.
Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.
Lifetime mortgages Lifetime mortgages are a form of equity release mortgage that provide non-commercial borrowers with a loan secured against their main residence, without the need for regular repayments.
They are regulated retail mortgages offered only to borrowers over the age of 55 through specialist intermediaries.
Interest accrues over the term of the loan and is repayable at the time the principal becomes due.
Loans can be advanced in a single lump sum amount or in several subsequent drawdowns of an agreed facility.
All lifetime mortgages provide a no negative equity guarantee, which means that if the loan is repaid from the sale of the property and the net sale proceeds are lower than the balance of the loan, the group will accept the net sale proceeds as full settlement.
Legal & General Investment Management LGIM LGIM offers both active and passive management on either a pooled or segregated basis.
Assets are managed on behalf of pension funds, institutional clients, sovereign wealth clients, retail funds and subsidiary companies within the group.
The core products are set out below.
Index fund management LGIM provides a diversified range of pooled index funds, providing a wide choice and the ability to pursue specific benchmarks efficiently.
In addition, segregated solutions are offered to institutional clients providing large scale customisation against established market capitalisation weighted and alternative indices.
Active fixed income and liquidity management A range of pooled and segregated active fixed income funds.
The LGIM liquidity funds offer institutional investors a solution for their cash management requirements across a range of core currencies.
The liquidity funds aim to deliver competitive returns with a high level of diversification, whilst focusing on capital preservation through portfolios of high quality, liquid assets.
Solutions and Liability Driven Investment LDI A range of pooled and bespoke solutions to help fide-risk defined benefit pension schemes.
These solutions will usually combine active or passive underlying portfolios with derivative overlays designed to meet clients specific requirements.
Solutions also includes a range of pooled multi-asset funds for retail and institutional clients, built using LGIMs expertise in asset allocation which is informed by an in-house research capability.
The underlying asset classes may be managed on an active or passive basis within LGIM.
An allocation strategy service is also offered to institutional clients, which may also allocate some of the portfolio to managers other than LGIM.
136 Balance sheet management continued 7 Principal products continued Legal & General Investment Management LGIM continued Active equity An active equity management business comprising focused teams managing stock selection across different regions.
Real Assets A range of pooled funds, segregated accounts and joint ventures investing on behalf of UK and overseas investors across physical real estate, private corporate debt, infrastructure debt and real estate loans.
The business has specialist teams of fund and asset managers and an inhouse research team.
Legal & General Capital LGC Investment strategy and implementation Legal & General Capital manages shareholder assets which are not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders.
LGCs investments fall into two distinct categories: direct investments and traded assets.
The value of, and income from, both categories is sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy.
Potential volatility in returns are managed using a range of techniques, including performance benchmarks, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging, and exposure concentration limits by asset type, sector and geographic region.
Direct investments and structuring Direct investments are an integral part of the wider group strategy.
Direct investments are typically illiquid investments entered into through acquisition, joint venture with strategic partners or by creating new companies directly.
LGC seeks to create revenue-generating direct investments in sectors where there are significant funding shortfalls, namely housing, infrastructure including urban regeneration and clean energy and SME finance.
LGC employs capital and sector expertise to target attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Legal & General Insurance LGI LGI business comprises UK retail and group protection, US protection and universal life business LGIA, networks, and the Netherlands business LGN, which was disposed of in 2017.
UK protection business retail and group The group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits.
They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benefits: these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately.
The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms.
Some sickness benefits cover the policyholders mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates.
In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and offer policyholders conversion options.
US protection business Protection consists of individual term assurance, which provides death benefits over the medium to long term.
The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter.
During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract.
After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.
Reinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims.
These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the group's balance sheet.
Within LGIA, reinsurance and securitisation is also used to provide regulatory solvency relief including relief from regulation governing term insurance and universal life reserves.
US universal life Universal life contracts written by LGIA provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long term.
The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate.
LGIA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate.
LGIA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.
The reserves for universal life totalled $557m 412m at 31 December 2017 $596m 482m at 31 December 2016.
The guaranteed interest rates associated with those reserves ranged from 1.5% to 6%, with the majority of the policies having guaranteed rates ranging from 3% to 4% 2016: 3% to 4%.
General Insurance GI General Insurance business comprises Household and Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU, and Pet products.
Household These contracts provide cover in respect of policyholders' homes, investment properties, contents, personal belongings and incidental liabilities which they may incur as a property owner, occupier and individual.
Exposure is normally limited to the rebuilding cost of the home, the replacement cost of belongings and a policy limit in respect of liability claims.
In addition, there is an additional cover option for Family Legal Protection FLP to cover costs of pursuing certain UK legal proceedings arising from, for example: death personal injury, buying hiring goods or services, infringement of property legal rights and breach of employment contracts.
Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU These contracts provide cover in respect of continuing payment liabilities incurred by customers when they are unable to work as a result of accident, sickness or unemployment.
Exposure is limited to the monthly payment level selected by the customer sufficient to cover the payment and associated costs, up to the duration limit specified in the policy, usually 12 months.
137 Balance sheet management continued 7 Principal Products continued General Insurance GI continued Pet insurance Legal & General Pet Insurance is currently arranged and administered by Ultimate Pet Partners Limited and underwritten by Legal & General Insurance Limited.
The policies aim to protect dogs and cats against unexpected accidents and illnesses.
These are then split into three categories accident only, 12 month or lifetime cover.
In 2017, the group agreed to acquire Buddies Enterprises Limited, with the deal completing in January 2018.
Buddies provide pet insurance policies which are largely marketed through breeders, and these policies will be underwritten by the group from January 2018.
1 Savings A range of contracts are offered in a variety of different forms to meet customers long term savings objectives.
Policyholders may choose to include a number of protection benefits within their savings contracts.
Typically, any guarantees under the contract would only apply on maturity or earlier death.
On certain older contracts there may be provisions guaranteeing surrender benefits.
Savings contracts may or may not guarantee policyholders an investment return.
The contracts fall into three main types: - Non-participating savings, pensions and endowment contracts: - Participating savings business, comprising endowment contracts, with-profits pensions and with-profits bonds: and - Unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products.
For unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders and therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented in respect of the associated assets and liabilities.
Unit linked business is written both inside and outside the with-profits fund.
Collective investment business is administered by Legal & General Portfolio Management Services Limited.
Pensions individual and corporate These are long term savings contracts through which policyholders accumulate pension benefits.
Some older contracts contain a basic guaranteed benefit expressed as an amount of pension payable or a guaranteed annuity option.
Other options provided by these contracts include an open market option on maturity, early retirement and late retirement.
The group would generally have discretion over the terms on which the latter types of options are offered.
Endowment policies These contracts provide a lump sum on maturity determined by the addition of annual and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a minimum sum assured death benefit.
With-profits bonds These contracts provide an investment return to the policyholder which is determined by the attribution of regular and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a death benefit, typically of 101% of the value of the units allocated to the policyholder.
Participating contracts The with-profits fund ceased writing new business on 31 January 2015.
Only increases to existing pension policies and new members to existing Group Personal Pension Schemes, where allowed for in the policy terms and conditions, have been accepted after that date.
Regular premiums in payment at the date of closure will also continue to be accepted.
Discretionary increases to benefits on participating contracts are allowed in one or both of annual and final bonus form.
Some older participating contracts include a guaranteed minimum rate of roll up of the policyholders fund up to the date of retirement or maturity.
Bonuses are determined in accordance with the principles outlined in the Funds Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM for the management of the with-profits fund.
The principles include: The with-profits fund will be managed with the objective of ensuring that its assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities and other regulatory and capital requirements without the need for additional capital from outside the With Profits Fund.
Bonus rates will be smoothed so that some of the short term fluctuations in the value of the investments of the with-profits fund and the business results achieved in the with-profits fund are not immediately reflected in payments under with-profits policies: The inherited estate is the excess of assets held within the With-Profits Fund over and above the amount required to meet liabilities, including those which arise from the regulatory duty to treat customers fairly in settling discretionary benefits.
Following the closure to new businesses of the With-Profits Fund on 31 January 2015, the Board agreed a run-off plan.
They will consider annually whether part of the inherited estate should be distributed to with-profits policyholders.
In adverse circumstances this may result in a deduction from investment returns in order to increase the value of the inherited estate.
The amount and timing of any distribution from or deduction to increase the inherited estate shall be determined by the Board.
Following this approach, the Board has agreed that there should be no distribution of the estate and no charge for options and guarantees as part of the 2017 bonus declaration.
The distribution of surplus to shareholders depends upon the bonuses declared for the year.
Typically, bonus rates are set having regard to investment returns, although the group has some discretion setting rates and would normally smooth bonuses over time.
The volatility of investment returns could impact the funds capital position and its ability to pay bonuses.
If future investment conditions were less favourable than anticipated, the lower bonus levels resulting would also reduce future distributions to shareholders.
The estate would normally be expected to absorb the impact of these investment risks.
Only in extreme scenarios, where shareholders were required to provide support to the WithProfits Fund to meet its liabilities, would these risks affect equity.
As part of the 2007 with-profit fund restructure, the 1996 sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
As a result, the Board of Directors of Legal and General Assurance Society Limited LGAS undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within LGAS to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment reduced from 50m at the end of 2016 to zero at the end of 2017.
In December 2017, the group announced the sale of its Mature Savings business to Swiss Re.
The sale is subject to regulatory approval and the Part VII transfer is expected to complete in 2019.
138 Balance sheet management continued 8 Asset risk The group is exposed to the following categories of asset risk as a consequence of offering the principal products outlined in Note 7.
The group is also exposed to insurance risk as a consequence of offering these products - more detail on insurance risk can be found in Note 18.
Market risk Exposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets.
Credit risk Exposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the group.
Liquidity risk The risk that the group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
The financial risks associated with LGIM's businesses are directly borne by the investors in its funds.
Therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented.
The group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board.
A description of the risks associated with the group's principal products and the associated control techniques is detailed below.

In addition, it ensures that, even under plausible but unlikely severe conditions, the group has access to the funds necessary to cover all outgoings such as surrenders, withdrawals and maturing liabilities.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had 3.6bn 2016: 2.9bn of cash and cash equivalents in shareholder funds and non-profit non-unit linked funds and a 1.0bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility in place, provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in December 2022.
143 Balance sheet management continued 9 Assets analysis The group has categorised its assets and liabilities in the following disclosure in accordance with the level of shareholder exposure to market and credit risks.
While the sale of the Mature Savings business will impact this exposure, and hence classification, in future years, the groups risk exposure at 31 December 2017 remains unchanged by the announcement of the sale.
Therefore, a consistent disclosure with prior year has been maintained.
The four categorisations presented are: Unit linked For unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
Unit linked business is written in both LGAS and Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders.
The group is therefore not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.
As a result, risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.
With-profits Policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and returns of the with-profits fund.
The return to shareholders on virtually all participating products is in the form of a transfer to shareholders equity, which is analogous to a dividend from the fund and is dependent upon the bonuses credited or declared on policies in that year.
The bonuses are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, property and fixed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns.
The with-profits classification excludes unit linked contracts.
Non profit non-unit linked Shareholders are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of assets backing non profit non-unit linked business held in the UK with-profits fund, which comprises Annuities, Protection and Non profit Savings products.
Shareholder All other assets are classified as shareholder assets.
Shareholders of the group are directly exposed to market and credit risk on these assets.
This includes the assets and liabilities of our overseas insurance operations and general insurance.
The table below presents an analysis of the balance sheet by category.
All of the quantitative risk disclosures in Notes 16 and 17 have been provided using this categorisation.

The value of business acquired represents the present value of anticipated future profits in acquired contracts.
These amounts are amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
Intangible assets acquired via business combinations, such as the value of customer relationships, are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised over their useful life in line with the expected emergence of profit from the business.
Where software costs are separately identifiable and measurable they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life.
Purchased interest in long term businesses and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

147 Balance sheet management continued 11 Deferred acquisition costs The group incurs costs to obtain and process new business.
These are accounted for in line with the appropriate accounting standards as follows: Long term insurance business Acquisition costs comprise direct costs, such as initial commission, and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
Some acquisition costs relating to non-participating insurance contracts written outside the with-profits fund which are incurred during a financial year are deferred by use of an asset which is amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable, and in accordance with the expected incidence of future related margins.
For participating contracts, acquisition costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
General insurance A proportion of commission and other acquisition costs relating to unearned premiums is carried forward as deferred acquisition costs or, in respect of reinsurance outwards, as deferred income.
Investment contracts For participating investment contracts, acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as initial commission and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
These costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
For non-participating investment contracts, only directly attributable costs relating to investment management services which vary with, and are related to, securing new contracts and renewing existing contracts, are capitalised and amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable from future revenue.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
Total deferred acquisition costs are presented gross of held for sale assets in 2017 and net of held for sale assets in 2016.
The maturity analysis of the assets between less and more than 12 months is based on Total as at 31 December balances.
Of the total gross deferred acquisition costs 1,407m 2016: 1,490m relates to the LGIA business.
148 Balance sheet management continued 12 Financial investments and Investment property The group holds financial investments and investment property to back insurance contracts on behalf of policyholders and as group capital.
The group classifies its financial investments on initial recognition as held for trading HFT, designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, available-for-sale AFS or loans and receivables.
Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.
The groups policy is to measure investments at FVTPL except for certain overseas assets where the related liability is valued on a passive basis not using current information, in which case investments are classified as AFS or loans held at amortised cost.
All derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classified as HFT.
Certain financial investments held by the group are designated as FVTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Investment and Market Risk Committee and the groups investment strategy.
Assets designated as FVTPL include debt securities including lifetime mortgages and equity instruments which would otherwise have been classified as AFS and reverse repurchase agreements within loans which would otherwise be designated at amortised cost.
Assets backing participating and non-participating policyholder liabilities outside the US are designated as FVTPL.
For participating contracts the assets are managed on a fair value basis to maximise the total return to policyholders over the contract life.
The groups non-participating investment contract liabilities outside of the US are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FVTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch in the income statement.
Financial investments classified as HFT and FVTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Financial investments classified as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity.
Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on non-equity instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.
Financial investments classified as loans are either measured at FVTPL, or initially measured at fair value plus acquisition costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The FVTPL classification currently only applies to reverse repurchase agreements.
Financial investments are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial investments are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire, or when the group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.
Financial assets, other than those at fair value, are assessed for impairment at each balance sheet date.
They are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events after initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return.
Investment property in the UK is valued bi-annually by external chartered surveyors at open market values in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period.
Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reflect any material changes in fair value.
The group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of various transactions, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions.
The amount and type of collateral required where the group receives collateral depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.
Collateral received in the form of cash, where the group has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding liability for its repayment.
Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the counterparty defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.
Non-cash collateral pledged where the group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated is not derecognised from Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.
Cash collateral pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding receivable is recognised for its return.

As at 31 December 2016 1,891m of reverse repurchase agreements were classified in Other assets.
On review, we have determined that these instruments meet the definition of a financial asset and therefore should have been included within Financial investments.
Accordingly, the prior year numbers have been restated resulting in a decrease in Other assets of 1,891m and an increase in Financial investments of 1,891m.
The instruments have been classified as Loans at fair value, and assessed as fair value Level 2.

There are no material differences between the carrying values reflected above and the fair values of these loans.
iii Fair value hierarchy Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the group's view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the group's level 2 assets have been valued using standard market pricing sources, such as iBoxx, IDC and Bloomberg, which use mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, except for swaps holdings.
In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices.
Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have classified them as level 2.
The groups policy is to re-assess categorisation of financial assets at the beginning of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time.
There have been no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2017 other than those noted above 2016: no significant transfers.

154 Balance sheet management continued 12 Financial investments and Investment property continued iii Fair value hierarchy continued a Level 3 assets measured at fair value Level 3 assets where internal models are used, represent a small proportion of assets to which shareholders are exposed.
These comprise property, unquoted equities, untraded debt securities and securities where the broker methodology is unknown.
Unquoted securities include suspended securities excluding investments in private equity and property vehicles.
Untraded debt securities include private placements, commercial real estate loans, income strips and lifetime mortgages.
In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In these situations, the group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the group has classified within Level 3.
The group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available.
The group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate.
As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the group's credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.
The most significant assets classified as Level 3, and the valuation methodologies applied to them, are described below.
Equity securities Level 3 equity securities amount to 1,451m 2016: 1,101m and are valued by a number of third party specialists using a range of techniques, including earnings multiples and price earnings ratios, which are deemed to be unobservable.
Other financial investments Lifetime mortgage loans amount to 2,023m 2016: 852m.
They are valued using a discounted cash flow model by projecting best-estimate net asset proceeds and discounting using rates inferred from current LTM pricing, thereby ensuring the value of loans at outset is consistent with the purchase price of the loan, and ensuring consistency between new and in-force loans.
Inputs to the model include property growth rates and voluntary early redemptions.
The valuation at 31 December 2017 reflects a long-term property growth rate assumption of RPI 0.5%.
Commercial real estate loans amount to 2,169m 2016: 1,777m.
Their valuation is outsourced to Markit who use discounted future cash flows based on a yield curve.
The discount factors take into consideration the z-spread of the LGIM approved comparable bond and an initial spread agreed by both parties.
The initial spread is the calculated premium required to discount cash flows to par value purchase price.
Income strip assets amount to 1,153m 2016: 953m.
Their valuation is outsourced to Knight Frank and CBRE who apply a yield to maturity to discounted future cash flows to derive valuations.
The overall valuation takes into account the property location, tenant details, tenure, rent, rental break terms, lease expiries and underlying residual value of the property.
Private placements held by the US business amount to 346m 2016: 373m.
They are valued using a pricing matrix comprised of a public spread matrix, internal ratings assigned to each holding, average life of each holding, and a premium spread matrix.
These are added to the risk-free rate to calculate the discounted cash flows and establish a market value for each investment grade private placement.
Commercial mortgage loans amount to 342m 2016: 365m and are determined by incorporating credit risk for performing loans at the portfolio level and for loans identified to be distressed at the loan level.
The projected cash flows of each loan are discounted along stochastic risk free rate paths and are inclusive of an Option Adjusted Spread OAS, derived from current internal pricing on new loans, along with the best observable inputs.
These are further adjusted for credit improvements due to seasonality and illiquidity premiums.
Other debt securities which are not traded in an active market have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations.
These prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transactions.
Investment property Level 3 investment property amounting to 8,337m 2016: 8,150m is valued with the involvement of external valuers.
All property valuations are carried out in accordance with the latest edition of the Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, and are undertaken by appropriately qualified valuers as defined therein.
Whilst transaction evidence underpins the valuation process, the definition of market value, including the commentary, in practice requires the valuer to reflect the realities of the current market.
In this context valuers must use their market knowledge and professional judgement and not rely only upon historic market sentiment based on historic transactional comparables.
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker.
These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee and validated independently as appropriate.
The groups policy is to reassess the categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time.

Other financial investments comprise debt securities, lifetime mortgages and derivative assets.
The realised and unrealised gains and losses have been recognised in investment return in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The group holds regular discussions with its pricing providers to determine whether transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy have occurred.
The above transfers occurred as a result of this process and further internal investigations.
In 2017, transfers into Level 3 include 874m of private placement and 795m of income strips, which were previously classified as Level 2.
In 2016, transfers into Level 3 included 1.6bn of commercial real estate loans, which were previously classified as Level 2.
Other Level 3 movements for the current year primarily reflects the deconsolidation of the group's investment in a property fund see Note 38. b Effect on changes in assumptions on Level 3 Fair values of financial instruments are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument and are not based on observable market data.
Where possible, the group assesses the sensitivity of fair values of Level 3 investments to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternative assumptions.
As outlined above, Level 3 investments are valued using internally-modelled valuations or independent third parties.
Where internally-modelled valuations are used, sensitivities are determined by adjusting various inputs of the model and assigning them a weighting.
Where independent third parties are used, sensitivities are determined as outlined below: Unquoted investments in property vehicles and direct holdings in investment property are valued using valuations provided by independent valuers on the basis of open market value as defined in the appraisal and valuation manual of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations have been determined using alternative yields.
Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations have been determined using alternative price earnings multiples.
No reasonably possible increases or decreases in fair values have been given for securities where the broker valuation methodology is unknown.
The group is therefore able to perform a sensitivity analysis for its Level 3 investments, which amount to 19.7bn.
The effect of changes in significant unobservable valuation inputs to reasonable alternative assumptions would result in a change in fair value of - 1.2bn, which represents 6% of the total value of Level 3 investments.
156 Balance sheet management continued 13 Derivative assets and liabilities The groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The group uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39 are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.
The groups principal uses of hedge accounting are to: i Defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a firm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur: and ii Hedge the fair value movements in loans due to interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations.
Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction.
The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis.
Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges between 80% and 125% effectiveness with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, within other expenses, in the current year.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reflected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance contract.
Cash inflows and outflows are presented on a net basis where the group is required to settle net or has a legally enforceable right of offset and the intention is to settle on a net basis.

Derivative liabilities are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within Payables and other financial liabilities Note 26.
The group has entered into fixed rate borrowings denominated in USD and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
In order to hedge these risks the Group has entered into a cross currency interest rate swap, enabling the exposure to be swapped into a fixed rate in its functional currency.
These had fair value totalling 119m and a notional amount of 1,099m at 31 December 2017.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in respect of these hedges during 2017.
158 Balance sheet management continued 13 Derivative assets and liabilities continued The contractual undiscounted cash flows in relation to non-unit linked derivatives have the following maturity profile.

Cash flows arising from implied events covered by credit derivatives are presented in the table above on an expected basis as cash flows within one year.
Forward foreign exchange contracts - net investment hedges The group hedges part of the foreign exchange translation exposure on its net investment in certain overseas subsidiaries, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
It recognises the portion of the gain or loss which is determined to be an effective hedge through reserves within shareholders' equity, along with the gain or loss on translation of the foreign subsidiaries.
Derivative contracts - held for trading The group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures in accordance with the groups risk management policy, but for various reasons are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship.
Therefore, these contracts must be designated as held for trading, and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Cash inflows or outflows are presented on a net basis where the group is required to settle net or has a legally enforceable right of offset and the intention is to settle on a net basis.

161 Balance sheet management continued 15 Other assets continued i Receivables under finance leases The Company leases certain investment properties to third parties.
Under these agreements the lessee is considered to retain all the risks and reward of ownership, therefore the contracts have been classified as finance leases.
At the lease commencement date, the Company has recognised a receivable asset in its balance sheet to reflect the net investment in the lease, equal to the present value of the lease payments.
The Company recognises finance income over the lease term to reflect the rate of return on the net investment in the lease.
In 2017 the group acts as a lessor of one finance lease, which is of 20.7 years duration and relate to the provision of healthcare services.
The other party, as lessee, is regarded to be the economic owner of the leased assets.

166 Balance sheet management continued 16 Market risk continued ii Currency risk The group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either insurance or investment contract liabilities or hedging.
The group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies, of which the largest is US dollars.
The group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the groups business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.
Businesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the Groups consolidated shareholders equity which is expressed in sterling.
This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits.
These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the groups regulatory capital requirements by currency.
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.
As at 31 December 2017, the group held 10% 2016: 19% of its total equity attributable to shareholders in currencies, mainly US dollar and Euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit.
The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts.
The groups management of currency risk reduces shareholders exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
The groups exposure to a 10% exchange movement in the US Dollar and Euro on an IFRS basis, where the values of economic hedging instruments are reflected at their carrying value as opposed to their notional amounts, are reflected below.
A 10% appreciation in the US Dollar to Sterling period-end foreign exchange rate would have a 1m 2016: 33m impact on shareholder equity and a 5m 2016: 3m on the US business profit before tax.
A 10% appreciation in the Euro to Sterling period-end foreign exchange rate would have a 33m 2016: 59m impact on shareholder equity.
17 Credit risk The credit profile of the groups assets exposed to credit risk is shown below.
The credit rating bands are provided by independent rating agencies.
For unrated assets, the group maintains internal ratings which are used to manage exposure to these counterparties.
Unit linked assets have not been included as shareholders are not directly exposed to risk.
The carrying amount of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements represent the maximum exposure to credit risk.
Of the total debt securities and accrued interest that have been internally rated and unrated, nil is rated AAA, 209m AA, 114m A, 225m BBB, 60m BB or below and 9m as unrated.
Of the total debt securities and accrued interest that have been internally rated and unrated, 484m is rated AAA, 3,210m AA, 3,029m A, 3,432m BBB, 78m BB or below and 55m of unrated.

Of the total debt securities and accrued interest that has been internally rated, nil was rated AAA, 267m AA, 109m A, 234m BBB, 71m BB or below and 112m as other.
As at 31 December 2016, 89m of reverse repurchase agreements were classified in Other assets.
Accordingly, the prior year numbers have been restated resulting in a decrease in Other assets of 89m and an increase in Financial investments of 89m.
Of the total debt securities and accrued interest that has been internally rated, 388m was rated AAA, 1,236m AA, 2,773m A, 2,061m BBB, 77m BB or below.

As at 31 December 2016, 18m of reverse repurchase agreements were classified in Other assets.
Accordingly, the prior year numbers have been restated resulting in a decrease in Other assets of 18m and an increase in Financial investments of 18m.
170 Balance sheet management continued 17 Credit risk continued Impairment The group reviews the carrying value of its financial assets other than those held at FVTPL at each balance sheet date.
If the carrying value of a financial asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.
There must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.
Impairment is only recognised if the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of assets held at amortised cost or fair value of assets classified as available for sale.
Assets which are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The table below provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets which have been impaired and the ageing analysis of financial assets which are past due but not impaired.
Unit linked assets have not been included as shareholders are not exposed to the risks from unit linked policies.

172 Balance sheet management continued 18 Insurance risk The group is exposed to insurance risk as a consequence of offering the principal products outlined in Note 7.
Insurance risk is the exposure to loss arising from experience being different to that anticipated.
Detailed below are the risks associated with each of the group's segments and the associated controls operated.
They are applicable to all stated products across the group.

which they remain ill. Higher than expected incidence or duration would increase costs over the level currently assumed in the calculation of liabilities.
1 For savings contracts providing Savings The pricing basis for contracts providing minimum assured death benefits include minimum assured death benefits, provision for future trends in mortality based on past experience.
The level of mortality risk higher mortality rates may result in accepted within each contract is not sufficiently material to warrant formal underwriting at an increase in claims costs.
1 Older contracts containing a basic Savings The ultimate cost of basic guarantees provided on older contracts will depend on the take guaranteed benefit expressed as up rate of any option and the final form of annuity selected by the policyholder.

However, the book of business guaranteed annuity option, expose itself is diminishing in size.
As at 31 December 2017 the value of guarantees is estimated the group to interest rate and to be 48m 31 December 2016: 59m.

Persistency risk In the early years of a policy, lapses LGI and The pricing basis for protection business includes provision for policy lapses.

Actual trends in policy lapse rates are monitored with adverse been recovered from product trends being subject to actuarial investigation.
For insured contracts, terms and conditions typically include surrender deductions to mitigate the risk.
In later periods, once the acquisition costs have been recouped, the effect of lapses and surrenders depends upon the relationship between the exit benefit, if any, and the liability for that contract.
Exit benefits are not generally guaranteed and the group has some discretion in determining the amount of the payment.
As a result, the effect on profit in later periods is expected to be broadly neutral.

Other risks Subsidence risk The incidence of subsidence can General Underwriting criteria for general insurance business includes assessment of subsidence have a significant impact on the Insurance risk, with an appropriate premium being charged for the risk accepted in line with industry level of claims on household practice.
Accumulation of risks There is limited potential for single incidents to give rise to a large number of claims across the different contract types written by the group.
In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long term and short term insurance business written by the group.
However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure.
The groups capital model seeks to measure risk correlations particularly those that would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios become more extreme.
An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.
Operational risk Operational risk is defined as loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events.
Potential for exposure to operational risk extends to all the groups businesses.
The group has constructed a framework of internal controls to minimise material loss from operational risk events recognising that no system of internal control can completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent action or reputational damage.
174 Balance sheet management continued 19 Long term insurance valuation assumptions The group's insurance assumptions, described below, relate exclusively to the UK insurance business.
The non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the group's operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.
The proposed sale of the Mature Savings business has not materially impacted the 2017 long term assumptions.
The impact of the business risk transfer agreement from 1 January 2018 as described in Note 43 on long term assumptions will be appropriately reflected from this date.
i Non-participating business For its non-participating business the group seeks to make prudent assumptions about its future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience.
The approach used to set non-participating assumptions is generally similar to that previously used to determine the assumptions used for Solvency I and there has been no material change in approach as a result of the Solvency II regulatory regime, which came into effect on 1 January 2016.
These assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.
There are no material changes to overall non-economic prudent assumptions or the minimum prudent economic margins at 2017 arising from the regular review of these prudent margins.
Valuation rates of interest and discount rates The valuation interest rate for each contract type is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract adjusted for the risk that asset proceeds are not received by the group.
For some business, this yield is the gross redemption yield or appropriate forward yield on fixed interest securities and the running yield on variable interest securities.
For other business it is the Internal Rate of Return on the portfolio of backing assets.
In 2017, the group continued to hold an additional reserve to protect against the risk of an uplift in defaults in the current economic environment and maintained the level of the long term default allowance at 42bps per annum 2016: 42bps for unapproved securities and property backing non profit business.
For approved securities and swaps backing the non profit annuity business, the allowance is 9bps per annum 2016: 9bps.
For unapproved securities backing non-profit annuity business, the credit default allowances equate to 54bps per annum 2016: 55bps when expressed over the duration of the assets held, leading to an overall total default provision of 2.7bn 2016: 2.7bn.
The group believes the total default allowance is prudent to cover all reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
For equity investments, the yield is based on the current dividend yield, adjusted for prudence.
For property holdings, yields are based on the rental income payable.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMIB of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and or UK death registrations, with an appropriate allowance for prudence.
These tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.
The majority of internal statistical investigations are carried out at least annually to determine the extent to which the groups experience differs from that underpinning the standard tables and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.
Persistency The group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually.
Persistency can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.
The group tries to balance past experience and future conditions by making prudent assumptions about the future expected long term average persistency levels.
For non-participating contracts where explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.
Expenses The group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business.
Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the groups business plan.
An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made, taking account of both salary and price information.
The expense assumptions also include an appropriate allowance for prudence.
Premiums For those contracts where the policyholder does not have the right to vary the amount of the premium paid, full credit is taken for the premiums contractually due at the valuation date.
For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, the provision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
ii Participating business For its participating business, the group seeks to establish its liabilities at their realistic value in line with the requirements set out in UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
Non-economic assumptions Non-economic assumptions are set to represent the groups best estimates of future experience.
175 Balance sheet management continued 19 Long term insurance valuation assumptions continued Economic assumptions Realistic reporting requires a market consistent economic model.
The model is calibrated using market data from a variety of market sources.
This enables assumptions to be determined for the term structure of risk free interest rates, and for property and equity volatility.
Risk free interest rates are determined with reference to the swap yield curve on the valuation date less a credit risk adjustment CRA of 10bps for 2017 2016: swap yield curve on the valuation date less a CRA of 17 bps.
Property volatility is set with reference to historic variations in property prices.
Equity volatility is set so that the model reproduces observed market prices of traded equity derivatives.
Correlations between asset classes are based on historic data.
Each investment scenario contains a consistent set of assumptions for investment returns and inflation.
Future bonuses Future reversionary and terminal bonuses are consistent with the bonus policies set out in Legal and General Assurance Society Limiteds LGAS Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
Guaranteed annuity options The guarantees are valued on a market consistent basis.
The valuation methodology allows for the correlation between interest rates and the proportion of the policyholders who take up the option.
Guaranteed cash options The liability is determined assuming that policyholders choose the most valuable alternative between the annuity and cash available at retirement.
Value of in-force non-participating contracts The group makes a deduction from the liabilities for the expected value of future profits arising on non-participating contracts written in the withprofits part of the LGAS Long Term Fund.
The economic assumptions used to calculate the value of these profits are consistent with those used to calculate liabilities for with-profits business.
Non-economic assumptions represent best estimates of expected future experience on this business.

The table above shows the assumption of the dominant product for the positive liabilities and the single rate for the negative liabilities.
An appropriate valuation interest rate is applied at all times during the projection, i. e. when liabilities switch from being negative to positive the valuation interest rate will also switch from being high to low.
The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.
The percentage of the table varies with the duration that the policy has been in-force for the first five years.
The percentage of the table varies with the duration that the policy has been in-force for the first two years.
For term assurance with critical illness, morbidity rates are assumed to deteriorate at a rate of 0.50% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females 2016: 0.50% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females.
There is an additive loading of 1.00% 2016: 1.00% for guaranteed term contracts post policy duration 5.
The percentage of the TM00 TF00 tables varies with the duration that the policy has been in-force for the first five years.
Thereafter, a bespoke mortality table constructed based on TM00 TF00 tables, AM92 AF92 tables and UK death registrations.
Mortality rates are assumed to reduce whilst business is ceded to reinsurer after which any reduction is maintained but no further reduction is applied based on CMI2015 2016: CMI2014 model with a long term annual improvement rate of 1.5% for males and 1.0% for females 2016: 1.5% for males and 1.0% for females.
Table created by blending PCXA00 with PNXA00 tables.
The base table to be used for bulk purchase annuity policies in deferment is PNMA00 up to and including age 55 and PCMA00 for age 65 and above for males.
The identical method is applied to females using PNFA00 and PCFA00.
For vested annuities, mortality rates are assumed to reduce according to an adjusted version of CMIB's mortality improvement model: CMI 2015 2016: CMI 2014 with the following parameters: Males: Long Term Rate of 2.00% p. a.
2016: 1.50% p. a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 120 Additional period smoothing is applied for males only by age-specific constant additions to initial rates.
In aggregate, assumptions regarding future longevity improvement at end 2017 have developed in line with emerging experience.
Different business classes have different effective dates for applying improvers.
For certain annuities, a further allowance is made for the effect of initial selection.
The basis above is applicable up to age 90.
After age 90 the basis is blended towards a bespoke table from age 105 onwards 2016: After age 90 the basis is blended towards a bespoke table from age 105 onwards.
Persistency assumptions Lapse rates assumptions are used in the valuation of certain classes of long term business.
Where this is the case, the valuation persistency basis is set by applying a prudential margin over the best estimate assumptions.
The tables below show the major products where lapse rates have been used.
For term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policy's lifetime when it is treated as an asset but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policy's lifetime when it is treated as a liability.
Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.
For unitised business, the margin acts to either increase or decrease the best estimate lapse rates, depending upon which approach results in the higher liability.
The direction of the margin is assessed for unit life business and unit pensions business separately.
A summary of the lapse basis for major classes of non-profit business is shown below.
The lapse rates for unit linked business represent the decrement from in-force to surrender.

For 2017 the group has aligned sensitivity analysis disclosure requirements across various reported metrics, primarily for interest rate, equity, property value, and annuitant mortality.
The current disclosure also reflects managements view of key risks in current economic conditions.
The interest rate sensitivity assumes a 100bps increase, and 50bps decrease, in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with a 100bps and 50bps change in the real yields on variable securities for respective sensitivity analyses.
For the UK with-profit funds, valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields adjusted to allow for the impact of PRA regulations.
The impact of economic sensitivities on shareholders share of with-profit bonus declared in the year is relatively nominal for its insensitivity to market movements due to the smoothing policies applied.
The interest rate sensitivities reflect the impact of the regulatory restrictions on the reinvestment rate used to value the liabilities of the long term business.
No yield floors have been applied in the estimation of the stresses, despite the current low interest rate environment.
The inflation stress adopted is a 50bps p. a. increase in inflation resulting in a 50bps p. a. reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield.
In addition the expense inflation rate is increased by 50bps p. a.
In the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields are unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions.
The equity stress is a - 25% in equity values.
The property stress adopted is a -15% in property market value.
Rental income is assumed to be unchanged: however the vacant possession value is stressed down by 15% in line with the market value stress.
Where property is being used to back liabilities, the valuation interest rate used to place a value on the liabilities moves with the implied change in property yields.
The credit default stress assumes a -10bps stress to the current credit default assumptions for unapproved corporate bonds which will have an impact on the valuation interest rates used to discount liabilities.
The credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of the individual bonds in the asset portfolio and their outstanding term using Moodys global credit default rates.
The annuitant mortality stress is a -1% in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.
The assurance mortality stress represents an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance contracts by 5%.
For any single weather event with claims in excess of 30m 2016: 30m but less than 520m 2016: 509m the ultimate cost to Legal & General Insurance Limited would be 30m plus 50% of the 5m XS 30m layer 2016: 30m plus 50% of the 5m XS 30m layer plus the cost of the reinsurance reinstatement premium.
The ultimate cost to the group is greater as a proportion of the catastrophe reinsurance cover is placed with Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, which is exposed to 93% of claims between 35m and 105m and Legal & General Reinsurance Limited, which is exposed to 71% of claims between 105 and 225m, a new participant in the Legal & General Insurance Limited catastrophe reinsurance cover in 2017.
The impact of a 1 in 500 year modelled windstorm and coastal flood event would exceed the upper limit of the catastrophe cover by approximately 295m 2016: 280m, with an estimated total cost to Legal & General Insurance Limited of 350m 2016: 335m and to the group of 490m 2016: 590m.
The above sensitivity analyses do not reflect management actions which could be taken to reduce the impacts.
The group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position.
A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities.
The analyses also ignore any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.
In calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged, though in practice, items may be correlated.
The sensitivity of the profit and equity to changes in assumptions may not be linear.
These results should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order, which could be significantly more or less than the amounts shown above.
180 Balance sheet management continued 21 Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract.
This is the case if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, other than a scenario which lacks commercial substance.
Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
Contracts can be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes significant.
Any contracts not considered to be insurance contracts under IFRS are classified as investment contracts.
A number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features DPF which entitle the policyholders to receive guaranteed benefits as well as additional benefits: the amount or timing of which is contractually at the discretion of the group: and which are contractually based on: - the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract: - realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer: or - the profit or loss of the company, fund or other entity which issues the contract.
Contracts with DPF are referred to as participating contracts.
With-profits contracts in the UK are classified as participating.
Long term insurance Death claims are accounted for on notification of death.
Surrenders for non-linked policies are accounted for when payment is made.
Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted.
All other long term claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due.
Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.
The change in the insurance liability reflects the reduction in liabilities due to the payment of claims in the year, offset by liabilities arising from new business.
The movement also reflects assumption changes relating to variables such as claims expectations, expenses and the unwind of the previous periods expectations.
Under current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, as permitted by IFRS 4, Insurance contracts.
- UK In the UK, insurance contract liabilities are determined following an annual investigation of the insurance entities in accordance with regulatory requirements.
For non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method.
This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs, and contractually guaranteed benefits.
For unit linked insurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.
For participating contracts, the liabilities to policyholders are determined on a realistic basis in accordance with guidance previously set out in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 27, Life assurance.
Although FRS 27 is no longer an operational standard, the group has grandfathered the provisions into its IFRS reserving methodology.
This includes an assessment of the cost of any future options and guarantees granted to policyholders valued on a market consistent basis.
The calculation also takes account of bonus decisions which are consistent with Legal & General Assurance Society Limiteds LGAS Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
The shareholders share of the future cost of bonuses is excluded from the assessment of the realistic liability.
In determining the realistic value of liabilities for participating contracts, the value of future profits on non-participating business written in the with-profits part of the fund is accounted for as part of the calculation.
The present value of future profits PVFP for this business is separately determined and its value is deducted from the sum of the liabilities for participating contracts and the unallocated divisible surplus.
Unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are received and non-unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are due.
- Overseas All annuity business written by overseas subsidiaries is recognised in line with those written in the UK.
All other long term insurance contract liabilities for business transacted by overseas subsidiaries are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods which reflect local supervisory principles or, in the case of the US, on the basis of US GAAP.
General insurance Liabilities, together with related reinsurance recoveries, are established on the basis of current information.
Such liabilities can never be definitive as to their timing or the amount of claims and are therefore subject to subsequent reassessment on a regular basis.
Claims and related reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in respect of all incidents up to the year end.
Provision is made on the basis of available information for the estimated ultimate cost, including claims settlement expenses, claims reported but not yet settled and claims incurred but not yet reported.
An unexpired risk provision is made for any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums and after taking account of investment return.
Liability adequacy tests The group performs liability adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash flows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount with the carrying value of the liability.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, initially reducing deferred acquisition costs and then by establishing a provision for losses.
181 Balance sheet management continued 21 Insurance contract liabilities continued Reinsurance The groups insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide financing.
Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured.
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.
Reinsurance is recorded as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which case the associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.
Contracts with reinsurers are assessed to determine whether they contain significant insurance risk.
Contracts that do not give rise to significant transfer of insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered to be financial reinsurance and are accounted for and disclosed in a manner consistent with financial instruments.

Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly, unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the table.

185 Balance sheet management continued 22 Investment contract liabilities Under current IFRS requirements, participating investment contract liabilities are measured using local GAAP, as permitted by IFRS 4.
In the UK, participating investment contract liabilities are determined in accordance with guidance previously set out in FRS 27, including a value for guarantees, in the same way as participating insurance contracts.
The groups non-participating investment contracts are all unit linked contracts.
These liabilities are measured at fair value by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the group's unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date.
Claims are not included in the income statement but are deducted from investment contract liabilities.
The movement in investment contract liabilities consists of claims incurred in the year less the corresponding elimination of the policyholder liability originally recognised in the balance sheet and the investment return credited to policyholders.

If refinancing under the group's credit facilities was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassified as repayable between one and five years.
Undiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had in place a 1.0bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in December 2022.

Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.

Savings Plan US.
The group pays contractual contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes.
The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
Contributions of 49m 2016: 52m were charged as expenses during the year in respect of defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The group operates the following defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas: - Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund the Fund.
The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995: the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2015: - Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme was, with a few exceptions principally transfers from the Fund, closed to new members from August 2000 and finally closed to new members from April 2007: the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2015: and - Legal & General America Inc. Cash Balance Plan US : the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2016.
The UK defined benefit schemes operate within the UK pensions regulatory framework.
The UK Fund and Scheme were closed to future accrual on 31 December 2015.
As part of this arrangement, payments to the Fund and Scheme in respect of future accruals ceased from this date and were replaced with a company contribution payment of between 5% and 15%.
In addition, as part of the closure, the company will contribute an additional 3m per annum until 31 December 2024 towards the deficit.
The assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds to meet long term pension obligations to past and present employees.
Trustees are appointed to the schemes and have a responsibility to act in the best interest of the scheme beneficiaries.
The trustees long term objectives are to minimise the risk that there are insufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme over the longer term, control the on-going operational costs of the schemes and to maximise investment returns for the beneficiaries within an acceptable level of risk.
The total number of members of the UK Fund and Scheme was: 2017 2016 Employed deferreds 264 381 Deferreds 3,568 3,900 Pensioners 3,593 3,524 7,425 7,805 194 Balance sheet management continued 25 Provisions continued ii Retirement benefit obligations continued Defined benefit schemes continued The group works closely with the trustees to develop an investment strategy for each UK scheme in order to meet the long term objectives of the trustees as noted above.
Each UK scheme has a Statement of Investment Principles which governs the mix of assets and limits for each class of asset.
As noted below, the asset mix of the UK defined benefit schemes is primarily split between bonds, Liability Driven Investment LDI funds and equities.
Additionally, certain parts of the liabilities of the scheme are secured by way of annuities purchased from the group.
These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes, but at 31 December 2017 the value of these annuities, on an IAS 19 basis, was 875m 2016: 779m.
The Scheme and Fund expose the group to a number of risks: Risk Detail Uncertainty in benefit payments The value of the groups liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out.
This in turn will primarily depend on the level of inflation and how long individuals live.
Volatility in asset values The group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in the Scheme and the Fund to meet future benefit payments.
Uncertainty in cash funding Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the group being required to provide higher levels of cash funding, although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years.
In addition, the group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension regulation.
These risks are managed within the risk appetite of the Scheme and Fund.
The sensitivity of the net obligations to changes in any of the variables are monitored and action is taken if any risk moves outside of the appetite During 2017, an asset switch was made for the Scheme and Fund, resulting in a significant reduction in the holding of equities and an increased holding in LDI Funds.
The main goal of the use of LDI is to hedge movements in the liabilities due to changes in interest rate and inflation expectations.
On a gilts flat measure, the Scheme and Fund currently hedge 68% interest rate changes and 64% inflation expectation changes.
Annuities are purchased to mitigate risks for certain parts of the pension liabilities which passes the risks from the Scheme and Fund onto the group.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out on the Scheme and Fund every three years, updated by formal reviews at each reporting date.
The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
Where the Scheme or Fund are in deficit following the triennial valuation, the group and the trustee agree a deficit recovery plan.
Both the Scheme and Fund have formal deficit recovery plans which aim to make good the deficits over a certain period of time.
The triennial valuation at 31 December 2015 showed a total funding deficit for both the Scheme and the Fund of 599m.
As a result of this, a recovery plan was agreed of 77m a year until 2024.
The latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2015 was completed on 15 August 2017.
The Scheme and the Fund liabilities have an average duration of 19.8 years 2016: 20.7 years and 20.1 years 2016: 20.8 years respectively.
The expected undiscounted benefits payments to members of the Scheme and Fund, including pensions in payment secured by annuities purchased from the group, are shown in the unaudited chart below: 195 Balance sheet management continued 25 Provisions continued ii Retirement benefit obligations continued Defined benefit schemes continued The liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the Fund and Scheme is not restricted.
Plan assets exclude the insurance contracts issued by the group.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows.
The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.
The benefits paid from the defined benefit schemes are based on percentages of the employees' final pensionable salary for each year of credited service.
The group has no liability for retirement benefits other than for pensions.
The Fund and Scheme account for all of the UK and over 97% of worldwide assets of the group's defined benefit schemes.
The principal actuarial assumptions for the UK defined benefit schemes were: Fund and Fund and Scheme Scheme 2017 2016 % % Rate used to discount liabilities 2.47 2.70 Rate of increase in pensions in payment pre-2006 service 3.67 3.70 Rate of increase in deferred pensions pre-2006 service 3.78 3.82 Rate of general inflation RPI 3.18 3.25 Post retirement mortality 2017: 80% 90% Male Female Fund and 70% 80% Male Female Scheme of PCMA PCFA 00 with improvement at CMI 2015 base date 2013 with long term rates 1.5% pa males and 1.0% pa females, with tapering linearly down to nil between ages 90 and 120.

Legal & General Netherlands was classified as held for sale in 2016.
During 2017 annuities were purchased from the group.
A premium of 161m 2016: nil was paid from the assets of the Scheme and the Fund to purchase these annuities.
These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes and so the actuarial remeasurement recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes allowance for this premium payment as well as annuity receipts over 2017 of 53m.
The gross amount of actuarial losses net of tax recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year was 72m 2016: 121m loss net of tax : cumulative 898 m 2016: 826 m. The post-retirement mortality assumptions have been updated to the mortality improvement table.
The effect on the defined benefit obligation of the Scheme and Fund of assuming reasonable alternative assumptions in isolation is shown below.
Opposite sensitivities are broadly symmetrical, but larger sensitivities are not necessarily broadly proportionate due to the existence of maxima and minima for inflation linked benefits.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Scheme and Fund.

Within derivative assets as at 31 December 2016, 839m of forward currency contracts have been reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2, following a review of the inputs required in their valuation.
23,163m of repurchase agreements have been restated from amortised cost to fair value Level 2 to properly reflect their classification as fair value through profit and loss.
At the same time 43m of accrued interest on repurchase agreements has been reclassified from Other to Repurchase agreements.
Future commission costs are modelled using expected cash flows, incorporating expected future persistency.
They have therefore been classified as level 3 liabilities.
The entire movement in the balance has been reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement during the year.
A reasonably possible alternative persistency assumption would have the effect of increasing the liability including held for sale liabilities by 4m 2016: 5m.
Significant transfers between levels There have been no significant transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 for the year ended 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: no significant transfers, other than those noted above.
199 Balance sheet management continued 27 Management of capital resources Solvency II The group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which it operates.
At a group level, Legal & General had to comply with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA at the balance sheet date.
In December 2015, the group received approval to calculate its Solvency II capital requirements using a Partial Internal Model together with the approval by the PRA of applications for major model change in December 2016 and December 2017.
The vast majority of the risk to which the group is exposed is assessed on the Internal Model basis approved by the PRA.
Capital requirements for a few smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds.
The groups US insurance businesses are valued on a local statutory basis, following the PRAs approval to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the group solvency calculation.
The table below shows the shareholder view of the group Own Funds, Solvency Capital Requirement SCR and Surplus Own Funds, based on the Partial Internal Model, Matching Adjustment and Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions recalculated as at end December 2017 in line with the PRA guidance.
The Solvency II results are estimated and unaudited.
As at 31 December 2017 the group had a Solvency II surplus of 6.9bn 31 December 2016: 5.7bn over its Solvency Capital Requirement, corresponding to a coverage ratio on a shareholder view basis of 189% 31 December 2016: 171%.
The shareholder view of the Solvency II capital position is as follows: 2017 2016 bn bn Core tier 1 Own Funds 11.6 11.0 1 Tier 1 subordinated liabilities - 0.6 2 Tier 2 subordinated liabilities 3.1 2.1 Eligibility restrictions 0.1 0.1 3,4 Solvency II Own Funds 14.6 13.6 5 Solvency Capital Requirement 7.7 7.9 Solvency II surplus 6.9 5.7 6 SCR coverage ratio 189% 171% 1.
Tier 1 subordinated liabilities of 0.6bn were redeemed on 2 May 2017.
Tier 2 subordinated liabilities include $1.35bn of USD subordinated notes issued in 2017.
Own Funds do not include an accrual for the dividend of 658m 2016: 616m declared after the balance sheet date.
Solvency II Own Funds allow for a risk margin of 5.9bn 2016: 6.4bn and TMTP of 6.2bn 2016: 7.0bn.
The SCR is not subject to audit.
Coverage ratio is based on unrounded inputs.
The shareholder view basis excludes the contribution that the with-profits fund and the final salary pension scheme would normally make to the group position.
This is reflected by reducing the groups Own Funds and the groups SCR by the amount of the SCR for the with-profits fund and the final salary pension schemes.
On a proforma basis, which includes the contribution of with-profits fund and the final salary pension scheme in the groups Own Funds and corresponding SCR in groups SCR, the coverage ratio at 31 December 2017 is 181% 31 December 2016: 165%.
On 6 December 2017 the group announced its intention to sell the Mature Savings business to the ReAssure division of Swiss Re.
Swiss Re assumed the economic exposure of the business from 1 January 2018 via a risk transfer agreement.
It is expected that the formal transfer of the business will be completed in mid-2019, subject to satisfaction of normal conditions for a transaction including court sanction.
The transfer will be effected by way of a Part VII transfer under the Financial Services Markets Act 2000.
The impact of the risk transfer agreement has been reflected in the 2017 Own Funds.
Due to the proximity of the transaction to the year end, the model change to make an allowance on the SCR will take place during 2018 and therefore the SCR in 2017 does not include any impact of the risk transfer agreement.

200 Balance sheet management continued 27 Management of capital resources continued Capital management policies and objectives The group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage.
The group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.
Capital measures The group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business.
The measures used by the group include: Accounting and Economic bases Management use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and Economic Capital basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.
The group maintains a risk-based capital model that is used to calculate the groups Economic Capital balance sheet and support the management of risk within the group.
This modelling framework, suitably adjusted for regulatory constraints, also meets the needs of the Solvency II regime.
Our Economic Capital model has not been reviewed by the Prudential Regulatory Authority PRA, nor will it be.
Regulatory bases The financial strength of the groups insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements see below.
Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements In each country in which the group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities.
The minimum capital requirements have been maintained at all times throughout the year.
This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.
The required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance companys liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance companys liabilities and risk exposures.
The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the group operates are detailed below: Group regulatory basis The group is required to comply with the Solvency II capital requirements using a Partial Internal Model.
The group capital requirements for a handful of smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds.
The groups capital requirements in respect of its US insurance businesses are valued on a local statutory basis, following PRA approval of the groups application to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the group solvency calculation.
UK regulatory basis At the balance sheet date, required capital for the life business was based on the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA.
All material EEA insurance firms, including Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, Legal & General Insurance Limited, and Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited LGIMs insurance subsidiary are required to hold eligible own funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement, calculated on an Internal Model basis.
These firms, as well as the non-EEA insurance firm Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited LGRe based in Bermuda contribute over 97% of the groups SCR.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital RBC based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.
Bermudan regulatory basis Bermudan regulated insurers are required to hold sufficient capital to meet 120% of the Bermudan Solvency Capital Requirement BSCR.
The BSCR model follows a standard formula framework: capital attributed to each risk is calculated by applying capital factors to the assets and liabilities.
The individual risk elements excluding operational risk are combined using a covariance matrix and then added to an operational risk charge.
201 Balance sheet management continued 28 Acquisitions During 2017 the group completed a number of small acquisitions, including 100% of Renaissance Villages later living sector for a consideration of 51m and 100% of English Care Villages later living accommodation for a consideration of 39m.
These businesses have therefore been consolidated in the group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
29 Disposals During 2017, the group made the following disposals: On 1 January 2017, the group completed the disposal of Cofunds Limited Cofunds to Aegon for 141m, net of transaction costs.
The sale included the Investor Portfolio Service IPS platform as well as Cofunds retail and institutional business.
The group carrying value of the investment was 141m resulting in a net nil current year impact to the group.
On 6 April 2017, the group completed the sale of Legal & General Netherland Levensverzekering Maatschappij N. V. LGN to Chesnara plc Chesnara for 161.0m 137m.

30 Held for sale and discontinued operations On 6 December 2017 the group announced the sale of its Mature Savings business to Swiss Re for 650m.
The sale is expected to be final in 2019 following the completion of the Part VII transfer.
As a result of the announcement the assets and liabilities of the Mature Savings business have been classified as held for sale.
The group also initiated the planned disposal of a number of investments which are expected to finalise in 2018.
These have also been classified as held for sale and the associated assets and liabilities included in the below table.
The 2016 balances relate to planned disposals of investment property, LGN and Cofunds, which were disposed of in 2017 detailed in note 29.

Included in Total assets of the disposal groups are assets in consolidated funds, which are held by the Mature Savings business and disclosed within Financial investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The group controls these funds and therefore consolidates 100% of the assets with any non-controlling interest recognised in the Net asset value attributable to unit holders.
Following the disposal of the Mature Savings business, the group currently anticipates that it will retain control of these funds and so will continue to recognise 100% of the assets while increasing its non-controlling interest in the Net asset attributable to unit holders.
Insurance contract liabilities include participating insurance contracts, unallocated divisional surplus relating to with-profits business and the value of in-force non-participating contracts.

208 Additional financial information continued 33 Tax The tax shown in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax Current tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values.
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or charged or credited directly in equity.
Tax attributable to policyholders and equity holders The total tax expense shown in the groups Consolidated Income Statement includes income tax borne by both policyholders and shareholders.
This has been apportioned between that attributable to policyholders' returns and equity holders' profits.
This represents the fact that the groups long-term business in the UK pays tax on policyholder investment return, in addition to the corporation tax charge charged on shareholder profit.
The separate presentation is intended to provide more relevant information about the tax that the group pays on the profits that it makes.
For this apportionment, the equity holders' tax on long-term business is estimated by applying the statutory tax rate to profits attributed to equity holders.
This is considered to approximate the corporation tax attributable to shareholders as calculated under UK tax rules.
The balance of income tax associated with UK long-term business is attributed to income tax attributable to policyholders' returns and approximates the corporation tax attributable to policyholders as calculated under UK tax rules.
Use of estimates Tax balances include the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Income Statement.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
For tax this includes the determination of liabilities recoverables for uncertain tax positions and estimation of future taxable income supporting deferred tax asset recognition.
Tax rates The table below provides a summary of the standard corporate income tax rates of territories we operate in.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020 have been enacted in UK law.
Enacted rates between 20% and 17% have been applied to UK temporary differences to calculate UK deferred assets and liabilities on the basis of when temporary differences are expected to reverse.
On 22 December 2017, the US passed US Tax Reform measures.
As a result the US federal corporate income tax rate has reduced from 35% to 21% from 1 January 2018.
The enacted rate of 21% has been applied to US temporary differences to calculate US deferred assets and liabilities on the basis of when temporary differences are expected to reverse.

The US federal corporate income tax rate has reduced from 35% to 21% from 1 January 2018.
2017 includes the impact of the one-off US tax benefit of 246m arising from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the US corporate income tax rate.
Excluding the impact of the US tax rate change, the effective tax rate was 20.8%.
Equity holders' effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the tax attributable to equity holders over profit before tax attributable to equity holders.
The UK standard tax rate is used in the above reconciliation as a significant proportion of the group's profits are earned and are taxable in the UK.
The group's standard corporate income tax rate for the year, reflecting the standard tax rates of the countries we operate in, proportionately applied to equity holders profits before tax by country, is 19.0% 2016: 20.3%.
210 Additional financial information continued 33 Tax continued ii Deferred tax - Consolidated Balance Sheet Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised provided for temporary differences and unused tax losses.
The recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences and tax losses are supported by management's best estimate of future taxable profits to absorb the losses in future years.

Pre the 2014 award, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period was dependent on the group's relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
New performance conditions attached to awards from 2014 result in the number of options that vest being equally dependent on the group's relative TSR and Earnings per Share EPS Dividend per Share DPS growth.
In addition, the awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds over three, four and five years.
The Share Bonus Plan SBP awards restricted shares, combined awards of CSOP options and restricted shares and combined awards of CSOP options and nil-paid options.
With the exception of the Executive Directors, recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments.
Under the HMRC tax-advantaged Employee share plan ESP, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first 20 of the employees' contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between 20 and 125.
There is currently no match on contributions between 125 and 150.
From time to time, the group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years.
The fair value of granted shares is equal to the market value at grant date.
The fair values of the share grants made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions: SAYE PSP Award date 7-Apr-17 18-Apr-17 Weighted average share price 246.3 249.3 Weighted average exercise price 201.0 n a Expected volatility 29% 17%-60% Expected life 3 - 5 years 3 - 5 years Risk free investment rate 0.16-0.42 0.10% Dividend yield 6.1% 6.1% ii Total recognised expense The total recognised expense relating to share-based payments in 2017 was 31m 2016: 26m before tax, all of which related to equity settled share schemes.

217 Additional financial information continued 37 Share capital, share premium and employee scheme treasury shares An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if: there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms: and the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
Where any group entity purchases the company's equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.
Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the balance sheet.

All shares issued carry equal voting rights.
The holders of the companys ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at shareholder meetings of the company.
ii Employee scheme treasury shares The group uses the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT and the Legal & General Group Employee Share Plan ESP to purchase and hold shares of the group for delivery to employees under various employee share schemes.
Shares owned by these vehicles are included at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are shown as a deduction from shareholders' equity.
They are disclosed as employee scheme treasury shares until they vest to employees.
Share-based liabilities to employees may also be settled via purchases directly from the market or by the issue of new shares.
The ESOT has waived its voting rights and its rights to some of the dividends payable on the shares it holds.
Employees are entitled to dividends on the shares held on their behalf within the ESP.

The decrease in non-controlling interest to 76m 2016: 338m reflects the deconsolidation of the Leisure Fund Unit Trust following a reduction in the groups equity holding in the fund which, taking into account all other factors associated with the groups investment in that fund, led to the judgement that as at 31 December 2017, the group no longer exercised control over the fund.
No individual non-controlling interest is considered to be material on the basis of the year end carrying value or share of profit or loss.

Total other liabilities are presented gross of held for sale liabilities in 2017 and net of held for sale liabilities in 2016.
The maturity analysis of the liabilities between less and more than 12 months is based on the Total other liabilities as at 31 December.
219 Additional financial information continued 40 Related party transactions There were no material transactions between key management and the Legal & General group of companies during the year.
All transactions between the group and its key management are on commercial terms which are no more favourable than those available to employees in general.
Contributions to the post-employment defined benefit plans were 93m 2016: 75m for all employees.
At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 there were no loans outstanding to officers of the company.
i Key management personnel compensation The aggregate compensation for key management personnel, including executive and non-executive directors, is as follows: 1 2017 2016 m m Salaries 10 9 Post-employment benefits - - Share-based incentive awards 4 5 Key management personnel compensation 14 14 Number of key management personnel 15 15 1.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, Key management personnel compensation included social security costs.
These costs should not have been included in the analysis, as they are not an employee benefit.
The table has therefore been restated to exclude these costs.
The restatement has no impact on either Total expenses nor Profit before income tax in the Companys Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 31 December 2016. ii Related party transactions The group has the following related party transactions: - Annuity contracts issued by Legal & General Assurance Society Limited LGAS for consideration of 161m 2016: 3m purchased by the group's UK defined benefit pension schemes during the year, priced on an arm's length basis: - Investments in venture capital, property and financial investments held via collective investment vehicles.

220 Additional financial information continued 41 Contingent liabilities, guarantees and indemnities Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions.
The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them.
The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.
Various group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time.
The relevant members of the group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
The provisions made are regularly reviewed.
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.
In 1975, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited LGAS was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Office on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of LGAS.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to LGAS against any liability LGAS may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of LGAS would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV is now owned by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Whether LGAS has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
LGAS has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given warranties, indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions or corporate disposals.
Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of group companies in support of their business activities including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain group companies' liabilities under the group pension fund and scheme.
LGAS has provided indemnities, a liquidity and expense risk agreement, a deed of support and a cash and securities liquidity facility in respect of the liabilities of group companies to facilitate the groups matching adjustment reorganisation pursuant to Solvency II.

221 Additional financial information continued 43 Post balance sheet events Mature Savings Risk transfer agreement Following the announcement of the sale of the Mature Savings business to the ReAssure division of Swiss Re, on 1 January 2018 the group entered into a risk transfer agreement with ReAssure Limited a subsidiary of Swiss Re, whereby the group will transfer all economic risks and rewards of the Mature Savings business to Swiss Re from that date.
The risk transfer agreement will stay in place until the business is transferred under a court approved scheme under Part VII of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which is expected to complete in 2019.
With-profits pension scheme contributions On 4 January 2018, the with profits fund, which forms part of the Mature Savings business being sold to Swiss Re, paid a one-off sum to the shareholder fund in exchange for the removal of all future obligations in respect of both deficit repair contributions and ongoing trustee expenses for the Legal & General Group UK Pensions & Assurance Fund and Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme.
Acquisitions The acquisition of Buddies Enterprises Limited announced on 17 October 2017 has been completed after the year-end.
222 Additional financial information continued 44 Subsidiaries The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of information about the groups subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and other significant holdings.
A complete list of the groups subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and significant holdings in this context is provided in Notes 44 and 45.
Subsidiaries are those entities including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts over which the group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the operating and financial policies in order to gain economic benefits.
Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
The interests of parties, other than the group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The basis by which subsidiaries are consolidated in the group financial statements is outlined in the basis of preparation Note 1.
The particulars of the companys subsidiaries, mutual funds and partnerships that have been consolidated as at 31 December 2017 are listed below.
The main territory of operation of subsidiaries incorporated in England and Wales is the UK.
For overseas subsidiaries the principal country of operation is the same as the country of incorporation.
All subsidiaries have a 31 December year end reporting date and are 100% owned, unless stated otherwise.
The registered office of all subsidiaries in England and Wales is One Coleman Street, London EC2R 5AA, United Kingdom, and in Ireland is Dillon Eustace, 33 Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, unless otherwise noted.
All subsidiaries are held through intermediate holding companies unless noted that they are held direct by the company.
Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital, are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights including potential voting rights and substantive and protective rights.
The group reassesses the appropriateness of the consolidation of an investee whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there has been a change in the relationship between the group and the investee which affects control.

231 Additional financial information continued 46 Interests in structured entities A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominating factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights might relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangement.
The group has interests in investment vehicles which, depending upon their status, are classified as either consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities as described below: - Debt securities, consisting of traditional asset backed securities, together with securitisation and debentures and Collateralised Debt Obligations CDOs : - Investment funds, largely being unit trusts: - Specialised investment vehicles, analysed between Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles ICAVs, Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs, Societes d'Investissement a Capital Variables SICAVs, Specialised Investment Funds SIFs and Property Limited Partnerships.
All of the group's holdings in the above vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment vehicle's offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investment vehicles.
The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle, including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle's manager.
All of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment vehicles for their services.
Such compensation generally consists of an asset based fee and a performance related incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.

Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
236 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax continued A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions.

Share-based payments The Company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries.
The fair value of the equity instruments granted is spread over the vesting period of the instrument and treated as a capital contribution to the respective subsidiary.
The total capital contribution is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
The capital contribution to the subsidiaries is accounted for as an increase in the investment in the parent companys financial statements.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimate, if any, in the cost of the investment in the subsidiary and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity over the remaining vesting period.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the accumulated capital contribution and the actual cost to the Company is transferred to retained earnings.
Any capital contribution is subsequently recharged to the respective subsidiary as incurred and the corresponding cost of investment is reduced.
