152 Glossary Alternative Performance Measures APMs In response to the Guidelines on APMs issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA, additional information is provided on the APMs used by the Group below.
In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not required under IFRS.
These additional measures commonly referred to as Alternative Performance Measures provide additional information on the performance of the business and trends to shareholders.
These measures are consistent with those used internally, and are considered critical to understanding the financial performance and financial health of the Group.
APMs are considered to be a key measure to monitor how the businesses are performing because this provides a more meaningful comparison of how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis and achieves consistency and comparability between reporting periods.
These alternative performance measures may not be directly comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies and they are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures.
