FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the company accounts For the fifty-two weeks ended 30 April 2017 34 Accounting policies Basis of accounting and presentation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements as issued by the Financial Reporting Council FRC.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
The company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: the requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: to disclose IFRSs issued but not effective: the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments: the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: the requirements of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements: the requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures, to present key management personnel compensation and intragroup transactions including wholly owned subsidiaries: the requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, to present certain comparative information and capital management disclosures: and the requirements of IFRS 1 to present an opening statement of financial position when adopting FRS 101 for the first time.
The basis for all of the above exemptions is because equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group in which the entity is consolidated.
Greene King plc is a public company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet.
The carrying value of investments is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
On transition to FRS 101, the previous GAAP carrying amount at the date of transition was regarded as deemed cost.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are derecognised when thecompany no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the companys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, andislikely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability or forecast transaction.
The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction affects the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised inequity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, thecumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 123 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the company accounts continued For the fifty-two weeks ended 30 April 2017 34 Accounting policies continued Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The company has an employee benefit trust for the granting ofshares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders funds.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Share-based payments Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
Thefair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken inthe fair value calculation of any vesting conditions service and performance, other than market conditions performance linked to the price of the shares of the company.
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and or service conditions have not been met.
Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
No estimates or judgments were considered to be significant.
