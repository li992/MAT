DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant Accounting Policies Daejan Holdings PLC is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance on 24 July 2017. a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and these are presented on pages 78 to 82. b Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the Companys functional currency and the Groups presentational currency, rounded to the nearest thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: investment property, derivative financial instruments and current asset investments.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Corporate Governance Report on page 41.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the events or amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of complexity, judgement or estimation are set out in Note 1 u below.
The accounting policies set out in this Note 1 have been applied consistently throughout the Group to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, except as described below.
Accounting standard changes The only standards, amendments to standards or interpretations that became effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 was IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements amendment.
The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations relevant to the Group have been issued but are not yet effective.
None of these has been early-adopted by the Group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures amendment IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements amendment IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities amendment IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 16 Leases IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements amendment IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows amendment IAS 12 Income Taxes amendment IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment amendment IAS 19 Employee Benefits amendment IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates amendment Page 53 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued IAS 23 Borrowing Costs amendment IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures amendment IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation amendment IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets amendment IAS 38 Intangible Assets amendment IAS 40 Investment Property amendment The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of these new standards on its financial reporting.
On IFRS 9 & IFRS 15 the Groups initial assessment is that these standards will not have a material impact on financial reporting.
c Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct relevant activities of an entity and an exposure to variable returns so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.
d Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
e Income available for distribution Under the articles of association of certain Group investment undertakings, realised capital surpluses are not available for distribution as dividends.
f Foreign currency translation The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on re-translation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
The cumulative translation difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero as at the date of transition to IFRS.
The year end and average rates used for these purposes were as follows: Year end Average 2017 2016 2017 2016 US Dollar 1.25 1.44 1.31 1.51 g Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk arising from operational and financing activities.
As these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would recover or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
h Investment property IFRS defines investment properties as those which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
All of the Groups property falls within this definition.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and subsequently recorded at fair value.
Page 54 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 External, independent valuation firms having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent relevant experience in the location and category of property being valued, value the portfolio annually at the Companys year end.
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The valuations are prepared either by considering the aggregate of the net annual operating income from the properties using a market yield capitalisation rate which reflects the risks inherent in the net cash flow which is then applied to the net annual operating income, or on a sales comparison basis.
Any gains or losses arising from a change in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property continues to be treated as an investment property, and is measured based on the fair value model.
Interest is capitalised on such developments to the extent that such interest is directly attributable to the cost of redevelopment.
A property interest under an operating lease is classified and accounted for as an investment property on a property-by-property basis when the Group holds it to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both.
Any such property interest under an operating lease classified as an investment property is carried at fair value.
Where material, the aggregate present value of the minimum future lease payments under such leases is recognised as a liability.
Acquisitions and disposals are recognised on the date that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Any resulting gain or loss based on the difference between sale proceeds and valuation is included in the income statement and taxation applicable thereto is shown as part of the taxation charge.
i Current investments Investments comprise equity securities and other investments held for trading and classified as current assets stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
j Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently carried at cost less an allowance for impairment.
These assets are not discounted as the effect is deemed immaterial.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term deposits.
These short term deposits are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Bank overdrafts are therefore included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved.
m Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
n Net rental income Net rental income comprises rent and service charges receivable less applicable provisions and costs associated with the properties.
Rental income from investment property leased out under operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the certain term of the Page 55 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
If a rent review is due but not yet agreed with the tenant any expected rent increase is only recognised when receipt is highly probable.
Service charge income is recognised as the services are provided.
Net rental income is stated net of recoverable VAT.
The cost of repairs is written off to the income statement in the year in which the expenditure was incurred.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
o Dividend income Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established which, in the case of quoted securities, is the ex-dividend date.
p Taxation Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities which, in the case of investment property, is assumed to be through sale, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
q Segmental reporting The Company has identified its operating segments on the basis of those components of the Group which engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses and for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to allocate resources and assess performance.
The Group has determined the Chief Operating Decision Maker to be the Board of Directors.
r Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than investment property see Note 1 h and deferred tax assets see Note 1 p, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment loss recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-inuse.
The value-in-use is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Page 56 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 s Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
t Loans and borrowings Floating rate and fixed rate loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recorded at amortised cost.
Transaction costs are deducted from the fair value at recognition and any differences between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
When mortgages are refinanced, any redemption costs are immediately recognised in the income statement.
u Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are set out above.
Not all of these policies require management to make subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
The following is intended to provide further detail relating to those accounting policies that management consider particularly significant because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.
i Property valuations The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective, depending on many factors, including the individual nature of each property, its location and expected future net rental values, market yields and comparable market transactions as set out in Note 9.
Therefore the valuations are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of difficult market or economic conditions such as those that have arisen following the EU Referendum and UK general election.
As noted in Note 1 h, all the Groups properties are valued by external valuers with appropriate qualifications and experience.
ii Income taxes The tax treatment of some transactions and calculations cannot be determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
In particular, the Group is discussing the treatment of historical financing arrangements with tax authorities as set out in Note 6.
In such cases, a best estimate of the relevant tax charge or credit is made, having regard to the extent of uncertainties associated with it.
Where the final outcome of such matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, those differences will be reflected in the income and deferred taxes amounts at the time of formal resolution.
Page 57 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2.
Segmental Analysis The Group is managed through two discrete geographical divisions and has only one product or service, being investment in property for the generation of rental income and or capital appreciation.
This is reflected in the Groups structure and in the segment information reviewed by the Board.

In the UK, the average number of staff provided by the property and administrative management companies who performed roles for the Group totalled 203 2016 206.
The average number of full time equivalents whose staff costs were borne by the Group during the year was 143 2016 147.
The aggregate staff cost of these persons is shown above and can be analysed as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Salaries 5,492 5,542 NI contributions 593 538 Pensions 713 747 6,798 6,827 In addition the property and administrative management companies provide, under agency arrangements, staff to perform various caretaking roles.
Those costs totalling 1,037,000 2016 1,071,000 are included within property operating expenses Note 3 under porterage, cleaning and repairs.
Details of Directors remuneration are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Financial Income and Expenses 2017 2016 000 000 Financial income: Bank interest receivable 44 36 Other financial income 455 300 499 336 Financial expenses: Interest payable on bank loans 3,053 2,904 Interest payable on mortgages 10,466 9,779 Other interest payable 13 9 13,532 12,692 Page 60 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 6.
Taxation Taxation based on the profit for the year of the Company and its subsidiaries: 2017 2016 000 000 UK corporation tax 8,026 9,139 UK prior year items 751 1,134 8,777 10,273 Overseas taxation 808 448 Total current tax 9,585 9,825 Deferred tax 33,830 34,234 Deferred tax reduction in future tax rate 7,149 13,822 Total deferred tax 26,681 20,412 Total tax charge 36,266 30,237 Reconciliation of tax expense Profit before taxation 198,396 173,242 Corporation tax at the standard UK rate of 20% 2016 20% 39,679 34,648 Reduction in future tax rate 7,149 13,822 Prior year items 751 1,134 Impact of different tax rates 6,582 10,145 Indexation and non-taxable items 3,426 1,143 Other 171 725 Total tax charge 36,266 30,237 Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 18 November 2015.
A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% effective 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016.
This will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax balances at 31 March 2017 have been calculated based on the rate of 17% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The Groups effective tax rate for the current year was 18.3% 2016: 17.5%.
The current year charge benefited from the reduction in the future UK tax rate to 17% enacted during the year, which reduced UK deferred tax liabilities while the prior year benefited from a reduction in the future tax rate from 20% to 18%.
This reduction was largely offset by tax on profits arising in the USA, where tax rates are higher than in the UK.
Also in the UK an element of our property revaluation gains are not taxable due to an indexation allowance.
The rate of this allowance increased to 3.1% 2016: 1.6%.
Tax liabilities are recognised when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority.
In assessing the amount of tax due the Group uses professional advisers in both the UK and the USA to assist in assessing tax due on open tax computations.
The principal uncertain tax item relates to enquiries opened by HMRC relating to the interpretation of tax legislation regarding historical financing arrangements that had been entered into over several years in the ordinary course of business but have now ceased.
At present the probable range of outcomes of the tax due is 0 to 49 million.
The directors have made an accrual which is near the middle of Page 61 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued this range and which is in their view an adequate estimate of potential tax and interest that might arise.
Due to the uncertainty associated with such items, it is possible that at a future date, on reaching a conclusion on these open tax matters, the final outcome may vary significantly.
Earnings per Share Earnings per share is calculated on the earnings, after taxation and non-controlling interests, of 161,779,000 2016 142,900,000 and the weighted average shares in issue during the year of 16,295,357 2016 16,295,357.
Dividends 2017 2016 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015, paid 13 November 2015 @ 53p per share 8,637 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016, paid 4 March 2016 @ 35p per share 5,703 Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016, paid 11 November 2016 @ 58p per share 9,452 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017, paid 10 March 2017 @ 35p per share 5,703 15,155 14,340 The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 10,266,000, representing 63p per share.
This dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Investment Property Long Short Total Total Freehold leasehold leasehold 2017 2016 000 000 000 000 000 Balance at 1 April 1,638,584 345,546 25,231 2,009,361 1,855,230 Disposals 1,192 1,192 3,682 New acquisitions 472 472 10,380 Additions to existing properties 29,495 211 29,706 16,559 Revaluation recognised in profit 131,315 13,181 12 144,508 117,947 Foreign exchange movements recognised in other comprehensive income 62,753 11,192 73,945 12,927 Balance at 31 March 1,862,619 368,938 25,243 2,256,800 2,009,361 External, independent professional valuations of all the Groups UK investment properties were carried out by Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP, RICS Registered Valuers at 31 March 2017.
The aggregate amount of 1,668.6 million is based on open market values, assessed in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014.
The Groups USA investment properties were also independently professionally valued at 31 March 2017 by Joseph J. Blake and Page 62 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Associates, Inc. and Metropolitan Valuation Services, Inc. both USA Certified General Real Estate Appraisers.
The aggregate amount of 602.5 million is based on open market values, assessed in accordance with the Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice of the Appraisal Institute.
All three valuers have recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.
The aggregate professional valuations included in the above table have been reduced by an amount of 14.3 million 2016 11.3 million, relating to lease incentives included in Trade and other receivables.
As explained in Note 1 u i, property valuations are inherently subjective, depending on many factors, including the individual nature of each property, its location and expected future net rental values, market yields and comparable market transactions.
These fair value measurements are unrealised and classified as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
There have been no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the year.
During the year 1.0 million 2016 1.3 million of unrealised property revaluation recognised in prior years was realised through the sale of properties.
Valuation techniques and key inputs We set out the valuation techniques used below and the key inputs used in these valuation techniques are set out in the tables over the page.
UK commercial property was valued using the income capitalisation method, requiring the application of the appropriate market based yield to net operating income.
Adjustments are made to allow for voids when less than five years are left under the current tenancy and to reflect market rent at the point of lease expiry or rent review.
Estimated fair value is sensitive to and would increase if either net operating income increased or estimated yield decreased.
UK residential property was valued using a sales valuation approach, derived from recent comparable transactions in the market, adjusted by applying discounts to reflect status of occupation and condition.
The largest discounts were applied to those properties subject to registered tenancies, reflecting the relative difference in security of tenure, whilst the smallest discounts were applied to those properties subject to assured shorthold tenancies.
The base discount for condition was reduced from 15% in 2016 to 10% in 2017 reflecting current estimates of costs being incurred.
Estimated fair value is sensitive to and would increase if the sales values increased.
USA commercial and residential properties excluding co-operative apartments have been valued using the application of a capitalisation rate, based on recent arms length transactions, to an assessment of stabilised net income, and for residential properties the values are cross-checked to recent comparative sales evidence.
USA commercial and residential estimated fair value is sensitive to and would increase if either capitalisation rates decreased or estimated rental values increased.
USA co-operative residential apartments have been valued using the application of a discount rate, based on recent arms length transactions, to an assessment of net income over the period to full reversion, cross-checked to recent comparative sales evidence.
USA unsold co-operative residential apartments estimated fair value is sensitive to and would increase if either discount rates decreased, estimated rental values increased or estimated sales values increased.
There are inter-relationships between the groups of inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
Movements in more than one input having the effect of increasing fair value would give rise to a magnifying effect on the valuation.
Conversely, movements of inputs having opposite effects on fair value would have a mitigating effect on the valuation.
Page 65 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued The present value of future minimum lease payments in relation to the leasehold investment properties is 9.8 million at 31 March 2017 2016 13.5 million.

Financial Assets and Liabilities The Groups financial instruments are analysed into categories as follows: 2017 2016 Financing Financing Carrying income Carrying expense amount expense amount income 000 000 000 000 Current asset investments 162 159 10 Current assets at fair value 162 159 10 Derivative financial instruments 3,084 86 3,170 788 Current liabilities at fair value 3,084 86 3,170 788 Trade and other receivables 65,062 455 63,119 300 Cash and cash equivalents 84,283 44 84,863 36 Current assets at amortised cost 149,345 499 147,982 336 Trade and other payables 48,276 13 52,817 9 Floating rate loans and borrowings 80,228 3,053 82,099 3,690 Fixed rate loans and borrowings 272,311 10,466 239,829 8,993 Current and non-current liabilities at amortised cost 400,815 13,532 374,745 12,692 Total financial instruments 254,392 12,947 229,774 11,578 The finance income of 86,000 2016: 788,000 relating to derivative financial instruments is stated net of 35,000 income 2016: 84,000 expense relating to credit risk movements.
Fair values of financial instruments The Groups financial instruments are either recorded at fair value or their fair values are not materially different from their carrying amounts except for fixed rate loans and borrowings.
These are stated at amortised cost as shown in the table above and as explained in Note 1 t. The fair value of fixed rate loans and borrowings was 287,351,000 2016 260,057,000.
At both the current and preceding year end there were no non-recurring fair value measurements.
The Group does not hedge account and all its interest rate swaps are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value, with any movement being recorded in the consolidated income statement.
The fair values of all interest rate swaps and fixed rate loans and borrowings are determined by reference to observable inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Fair values have been determined by discounting expected future cash flows using market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument, as adjusted to reflect the credit risk attributable to the Group and, where relevant, its counterparty.
Page 70 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Financial instrument risk management In common with all businesses, the Group is exposed to the following types of risk which arise from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk This note presents information about the nature of the Groups exposure to such risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Reference to disclosures given elsewhere in the financial statements is included as appropriate.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, has delegated to the finance function the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of those objectives.
The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups trade receivables from tenants.
Trade receivables The majority of the Groups rental income is demanded quarterly in advance and demands are sent out prior to the due date.
Management monitors arrears continually and prompt action is taken to address potential defaults as appropriate.
The credit worthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to the agreement of the lease.
Where appropriate collateral is required by the Group to support lease obligations.
In many cases this takes the form of a tenant security deposit but also includes parent company guarantees, bank or other guarantees where appropriate.
Provision is made on a sliding scale against any rental arrears where recovery is in doubt or where solicitors have been instructed to recover the debt, with full provision for impairment usually being made where a tenant is in arrears for more than a year.
Details of the Groups trade receivables and the extent of impairment provisions against them are set out in Note 11.
Due to the large number of tenants across various sectors and geographical locations, the Board does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
Cash and derivative financial instruments The credit rating of counterparties to financial instruments is kept under review.
The Groups interest rate swaps are currently out-of-the-money: consequently, counterparty risk on swaps does not represent a major risk at the current time.
The counterparty risk on cash and short-term deposits is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any institution by reference to their credit rating.
Such balances are generally placed with major financial institutions where credit risk is not considered significant.
Maximum exposure The aggregate carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets, which are stated net of impairment provisions, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking into account the value of the tenant security deposits held and other collateral.
Page 71 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Groups management of its working capital and the finance charges and amortisation of its loans and borrowings.
The Groups policy is to seek to maintain cash balances to meet all short and medium term requirements.
The Group has a low level of gearing relative to the property investment sector as a whole and has long standing relationships with many leading banks and financial institutions from which the Board expect to be able to raise further funds if required.
At 31 March 2017, gearing was 14.6 per cent.
on the basis of gross debt to gross assets.
Cash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2017 were 84.3 million 2016 84.9 million and 49.3 million of loans and borrowings were repayable within one year 2016 15.5 million.
In addition, at the same date, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 48.4 million 2016 48.4 million, which expire between 2018 and 2022.
The maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash flows arising from the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2017 was as follows: 2017 Aggregate Due Due Due Due after Carrying undiscounted within within within more than amount cash flows one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 80,228 80,228 2,269 26,712 51,247 Mortgages 272,311 272,311 47,028 30,514 47,891 146,878 Interest 71,774 11,206 9,857 21,870 28,841 Interest rate swaps 3,084 5,822 1,320 971 1,135 2,396 Trade and other payables 48,276 48,276 48,276 403,899 478,411 110,099 68,054 122,143 178,115 2016 Carrying Aggregate Due Due Due Due after amount undiscounted within within within more than cash flows one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 82,099 82,099 1,375 1,375 79,349 Mortgages 239,829 239,829 14,141 32,629 53,122 139,937 Interest 74,696 10,910 9,762 21,927 32,097 Interest rate swaps 3,170 3,424 1,298 1,298 828 Trade and other payables 52,817 52,817 52,817 377,915 452,865 80,541 45,064 155,226 172,034 Market risk Market risk arises mainly from the impact that changes in interest rates might have on the cost of Group borrowing and the impact that changes in the US dollar sterling rate of exchange might have on the Groups recognition of its USA net assets.
Interest rates The Group seeks to reduce the interest rate risk by fixing rates on a majority of its loans and borrowings, whilst maintaining some loans at floating rates in order to retain flexibility in relation to short term interest rates.
Interest rates are fixed either through the use of fixed rate mortgage finance or through interest rate swaps.
The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these Page 72 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 only to limit exposure to potential interest rate fluctuations.
The interest rate profile of the Groups loans and borrowings is set out in Note 15.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 0.6 million per annum, on the basis of the floating rate debt outstanding at 31 March 2017, after taking account of the interest swaps in place.
There also exists a risk to the income statement arising from the recognition and re-measurement of interest rate swaps at fair value.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would give rise to a reduction in fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 March 2017 of 3.1 million, together with a corresponding increase in the Groups profit before taxation.
Interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps held by the Group at the year end were as follows: Contracted rate Notional principal Fair value 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Per cent.
000 000 000 000 Maturing within one to two years 5.6 5.6 25,000 25,000 2,084 3,170 Maturing after five years 1.6 30,000 1,000 55,000 25,000 3,084 3,170 Foreign exchange rates The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk in relation to its USA net assets by funding its USA investment property with US dollar denominated loans and borrowings.
As the Groups investment in USA assets are held for the long term and funds are not usually returned to the UK, the Groups policy is not to hedge its residual exposure.
Management monitors exchange rates on a regular basis and elects to transfer funds only when the rate is favourable to do so.
It is estimated that a 10 per cent depreciation of the US dollar against sterling would cause a decrease in the sterling value of the Groups USA net assets of 25.1 million.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent together with net debt.
This is kept under constant review to ensure the Group has sufficient capital to fund its operations and that the Groups strategy of low gearing is maintained.
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between longer-term finance appropriate to fund its long-term investment property holding strategy and cost effectiveness, given availability of debt in the market.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Net debt comprises a mix of fixed rate mortgages and shorter-term bank loans as set out in Note 15 and cash and short term deposits as set out in Note 12.
All loans and borrowings are secured against investment property and the bank loans are drawn against committed facilities.
Related Party Transactions Day-to-day management of the Groups properties and its operations in the UK is mainly carried out by Highdorn Co. Limited and by Freshwater Property Management Limited.
Mr B S E Freshwater and Mr S I Freshwater are Directors of both companies.

The amounts paid and payable by the Group for the provision of property and other management services by Highdorn Co. Limited and Freshwater Property Management Limited, included above, were as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Balance due to related party managing agents at 1 April 2,891 4,087 Charged during the year 4,488 3,975 Paid during the year 5,490 5,171 Balance due to related party managing agents at 31 March 1,889 2,891 Mr B S E Freshwater, Mr S I Freshwater and Mr D Davis are trustees of two charities that own 6.3% of the share capital of the Company.
These charities have received dividend payments in the year of 960,659 2016 909,010.
The Directors interests in the Company and the principal shareholders are described on pages 30 and 31.
The Board considers that the Directors are the key management personnel of the Group and their remuneration is disclosed on page 35.
Contingent Liabilities The Group is from time to time party to legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors are not aware of any current actions which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
Operating Lease Agreements The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases which vary in terms and provisions between type of property and type of tenure.
Leases providing for contingent rents are rare within the Groups property portfolio and no amounts for contingent rents are included in rental income for the year 2016 Nil.
At the balance sheet date, future minimum lease payments receivable by the Group under operating leases were as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Due within one year 76,536 75,480 Due within one to two years 49,043 45,112 Due within two to five years 105,796 97,011 Due after more than five years 273,792 301,211 505,167 518,814 Many of the Groups residential properties are let under assured shorthold tenancies which typically are for initial terms of 12 months or less, whereafter they are cancellable at short notice.
The Groups experience is that a significant proportion of such tenancies are held over after the expiry of their initial term.
