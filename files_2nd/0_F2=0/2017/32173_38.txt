Financial Statements Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Principal accounting policies SSE plc the Company is a company domiciled in Scotland.
The address of the registered office is given on the back cover.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosures FRS 101 and its interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
This represents a change in accounting standards adopted as the Company previously adopted IFRS, as a result of the change no transitional adjustments were identified.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement and related notes.
It has also taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101: A Cash flow statement and related notes: Related party disclosures: Disclosures in respect of capital management: and The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
As the consolidated financial statements of SSE plc include the equivalent disclosure, the Company has also taken advantage of the exemptions, under FRS 101, available in respect of the following disclosure: Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial instrument disclosures.
Share-based payments required by paragraphs 45 b and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Going concern The Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.
Basis of measurement The financial statements of the Company are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, available-forsale financial assets and assets of the Company pension scheme which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Company pension scheme which are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view.
The financial statements of the Company are presented in pounds sterling.
Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements.
The Groups key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted in Note 4.1 of the consolidated financial statements, with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately.
Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these individual financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Investments In the Company, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment charges.
Interests in joint arrangements and associates Associates are those investments over which the Company has significant influence but neither control nor joint control.
The Companys interests in its joint operations are accounted for by recognising its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the operation.
In these arrangements, the Companys share of the revenue will be eliminated as it relates to its purchased share of the output from the arrangement.
The Companys joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the joint venture and associate investments are carried at historical cost plus the Companys share of post-acquisition results, less any impairment in value.
The Company recognises its share of the results of these equity-accounted operations after tax and interest in the income statement.

This dual tranche issue comprises 300m with a coupon of 3.625% and $900m with a coupon of 4.75%.
The $900m tranche has been swapped back to both Euros and Sterling, bringing the all-in rate down to 2.72% and resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches to SSE of 3.02% per annum which compares favourably to the all-in funding cost of 4.02% achieved on SSEs most recent hybrid equity securities issued in 2015.
Due to the hybrids having a fixed redemption date, they have been accounted for as a debt item and included within Loans in Loans and Borrowings above, this is in contrast to the previous hybrid issues which have no fixed redemption date and are accounted as Equity, see Note 9.
