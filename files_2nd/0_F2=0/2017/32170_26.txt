Corporate information and operations Assura plc Assura is incorporated in England and Wales and the Companys Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
As of 1 April 2013, the Group has elected to be treated as a UK REIT.
See Note 6 for further details.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and investment properties, including investment properties under construction and land which are included at fair value.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs and interpretations adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Standards affecting the financial statements The following standards and amendments became effective for the Company in the year ended 31 March 2017.
The pronouncements either had no material impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes in presentation and disclosure only: n Annual improvements 20102012 cycle n Annual improvements 20112013 cycle Standards in issue not yet effective The following standards and amendments are in issue as at the date of the approval of these financial statements, but are not yet effective for the Company.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed below will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company in future periods but are continuing to assess the potential impact effective for periods beginning on or after the date in brackets.
In particular, lease income is outside the scope of IFRS 15 and as the Group is a lessor, IFRS 16 is not expected to materially impact the treatment of leases to tenants.
n IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 n IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 n IFRS 16 Leases not yet endorsed in the EU n Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of share-based payment transactions 1 January 2018 n Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiative 1 January 2017 n Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses 1 January 2017 n Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 20142016 Cycle The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors Report on page 66 and are presented in sterling.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements.
All intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Key sources of estimation and uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation and uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Property valuations The key source of estimation and uncertainty relates to the valuation of the property portfolio, where a valuation is obtained twice a year from professionally qualified external valuers.
The evidence to support these valuations is based primarily on recent, comparable market transactions on an arms length basis.
However, the assumptions applied are inherently subjective and so are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
Property valuations are one of the principal uncertainties of the Group.
Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of valuation are set out on page 80 and they key unobservable inputs relating to the valuations are set out in Note 10.

Significant accounting policies continued Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors do not consider there to be significant judgements applied with regards to the policies adopted.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
In the Company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
In addition, the Company recognises dividend income when the rights to receive payment have been established normally when declared and paid.
Where properties are acquired through the purchase of a corporate entity but the transaction does not meet the definition of a business combination under IFRS 3, the purchase is treated as an asset acquisition.
Where the acquisition is considered a business combination, the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is held as goodwill, initially recognised at cost with subsequent impairment assessments completed at least annually.
Where the initial calculation of goodwill arising is negative, this is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property portfolio Properties are externally valued on an open market basis, which represents fair value, as at the balance sheet date and are recorded at valuation.
Any surplus or deficit arising on revaluing investment properties and investment property under construction IPUC is recognised in the income statement.
All costs associated with the purchase and construction of IPUC are capitalised including attributable interest.
Interest is calculated on the expenditure by reference to specific borrowings where relevant and otherwise on the average rate applicable to short-term loans.
When IPUC are completed, they are classified as investment properties.
In determining whether leases and related properties represent operating or finance leases, consideration is given to whether the tenant or landlord bears the risks and rewards of ownership.
Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classified as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Where an investment property is held under a head lease it is initially recognised as an asset as the sum of the premium paid on acquisition and the present value of minimum ground rent payments.
The corresponding rent liability to the head leaseholder is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
The market value of investment property as estimated by an external valuer is increased for the unamortised pharmacy lease premium held at the balance sheet date.
Net rental income Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis and recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
A rent adjustment based on open market estimated rental value is recognised from the rent review date in relation to unsettled rent reviews.
Pharmacy lease premiums received from tenants are spread over the lease term, even if the receipts are not received on such a basis.
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease.
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through service charges is charged to the income statement.
com 81 Notes to the accounts continued For the year ended 31 March 2017 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Gains on sale of properties Gains on sale of properties are recognised on the completion of the contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous reporting period, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
Financial assets and liabilities Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and discounted as appropriate.
Other investments are shown at amortised cost and held as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate.
Debt instruments are stated at their net proceeds on issue.
Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are spread over the period to redemption at a constant rate on the carrying amount of the liability.
Financial instruments Where the Group uses derivative financial instruments, in the form of interest rate swaps, to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations they are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The resulting gains or losses are recognised through the income statement.
Cash equivalents are limited to instruments with a maturity of less than three months.
Tax Current tax is expected tax payable on any non-REIT taxable income for the period and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or tax deductible.
Deferred tax is provided on items that may become taxable at a later date, on the difference between the balance sheet value and tax base value.
Income statement definitions EPRA earnings represents profit calculated in accordance with the guide published by the European Public Real Estate Association.
See Note 7 for details of the adjustments.
Underlying profit is no longer reported to avoid confusion, being very similar to the industry standard EPRA EPS measure which is now reported.
Capital and other represents all other statutory income statement items that are excluded from EPRA earnings.
Employee costs Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Share-based employee remuneration Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight line basis.
The fair value of share options is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Model and is dependent on factors including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk free interest rate.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to share options granted.
Segmental information The Group is run as one business and as such no segmental analysis is presented for the current or prior year results.

The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Groups property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or sold in the three years post completion of development.
The Group will otherwise be subject to corporation tax at 19% in 2018 2017: 20%.
The Group tax credit charge relates to its non-property income.
As the Group has sufficient brought forward tax losses, no tax is due and so the amount represents the movement in deferred tax.
The movement in part relates to brought forward losses that have been utilised during the year, with the remainder representing a change in the estimated losses that will be utilised in the future.
As a REIT, the Group is required to pay Property Income Distributions PIDs equal to at least 90% of the Groups rental profit calculated by reference to tax rules rather than accounting standards.
In the year to 31 March 2016, the taxable rental profit of the Group was nil as a result of capital allowances available, and consequently no PID was required.
A small PID is expected to be required for the year to 31 March 2017 which will be distributed in due course within the usual quarterly dividends and in advance of the payment deadline of 31 March 2018.
To remain as a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Groups qualifying activities and the balance of business.
The Group remains compliant at 31 March 2017.
Further reductions in the main rate of corporation tax have been substantively enacted: the rate reduced to 19% from 1 April 2017 and will reduce to 17% from 1 April 2020.
These changes have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax.

Property assets Investment property and investment property under construction IPUC Properties are stated at fair value, which has been determined for the Group by Savills Commercial Limited and Jones Lang LaSalle as at 31 March 2017.
The properties have been valued individually and on the basis of open market value in accordance with RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014 the Red Book.
Valuers are paid on the basis of a fixed fee arrangement, subject to the number of properties valued.
Initial yields mainly range from 4.40% to 5.00% 2016: 4.65% to 5.25% for prime units, increasing up to 8.00% March 2016: 6.15% for older units with shorter unexpired lease terms.
For properties with weaker tenants and poorer units, the yields range from 6.00% to 12.00% March 2016: 6.15% and over 8.0% and higher for those very close to lease expiry or those approaching obsolescence.
A 0.25% shift of valuation yield would have approximately a 68.1 million 2016: 54.2 million impact on the investment property valuation.

Property assets continued Descriptions and definitions relating to valuation techniques and key unobservable inputs made in determining fair values are as follows: Valuation techniques used to derive Level 3 fair values The valuations have been prepared on the basis of fair market value which is defined in the RICS Valuation Standards as the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
Unobservable inputs These include: estimated rental value ERV based on market conditions prevailing at the valuation date: estimated average increase in rent based on both market estimations and contractual situations: equivalent yield defined as the weighted average of the net initial yield and reversionary yield : and the physical condition of the property determined by inspections on a rotational basis.
A decrease in the ERV would decrease market value.
A decrease in the equivalent yield would increase the market value.
An increase in the remaining lease term would increase the fair value.
Property, plant and equipment The Group holds computer and other equipment assets with cost of 1.0 million 2016: 0.7 million and accumulated depreciation of 0.6 million 2016: 0.5 million, giving a net book value of 0.4 million 2016: 0.2 million.

Share-based payments As at 31 March 2017, the Group had two long-term incentive schemes in place the Value Creation Plan VCP and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
The long-term incentive arrangements are structured so as to align the incentives of relevant Executives with the long-term performance of the business and to motivate and retain key members of staff.
To the extent practicable long-term incentives are provided through the use of share-based or share-fulfilled remuneration to provide alignment of objectives with the Groups shareholders.
Long-term incentive awards are granted by the Remuneration Committee, which reviews award levels on a case by case basis.
As at 31 March 2017, the Employee Benefit Trust held a total of 61,898 2016: 1,256,714 Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each in Assura plc.

Share-based payments continued The fair value of the newly issued PSP equity settled units granted during the year was estimated as at the date of grant using the Stochastic Model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which units were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the models used for the year ended 31 March 2017: 2017 Expected share price volatility % 23 Risk free interest rate % 0.03 Expected life of units years 3 The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The fair value of the units granted in 2017 was 454,600 based on the market price at the date the units were granted.
This cost is allocated over the vesting period.
The cost allocation for all outstanding units in the period was a charge of 318,000 2016: 468,500 and a credit has been recorded during the year in respect of the lower than expected employer national insurance contributions payable on the awards that vested during the period so that the total income statement charge was 0.1 million 2016: 1.9 million.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group holds cash and liquid resources as well as having debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments and properties are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and capital risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
In the event of a default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental income shortfall and may incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property.
Given the nature of the Companys tenants and enhanced rights of landlords who can issue proceedings and enforcement by bailiffs, defaults are rare and potential defaults are managed carefully by the credit control department.
The maximum credit exposure in aggregate is one quarters rent of circa 18 million: however, this amount derives from all the tenants in the portfolio and such a scenario is hypothetical.
The Groups credit risk is well spread across circa 800 tenants at any one time.
Furthermore the bulk of the Groups property income derives from the NHS or is reimbursed by the NHS, which has an obligation to ensure that patients can be seen and treated and steps in when GPs are unable to practise, hence the risk of default is minimal.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.
com 95 Notes to the accounts continued For the year ended 31 March 2017 23.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
Investments in property are relatively illiquid: however, the Group has tried to mitigate this risk by investing in modern purpose built medical centres which are let to GPs and NHS PropCo.
In order to progress its property investment and development programme, the Group needs access to bank and equity finance, both of which may be difficult to raise notwithstanding the quality, long lease length, NHS backing, and geographical and lot size diversity of its property portfolio.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring that it has a spread of sources and maturities.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of up to 30 years and have a weighted average lease length of 13.2 years.
All leases are subject to revision of rents according to various rent review clauses.
Future minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases along with trade and other receivable as at 31 March are as follows: On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 demand 3 months months years 5 years Total Receivables as at 31 March 2017 m m m m m m Non-cancellable leases 18.8 56.5 289.0 648.5 1,012.8 Trade and other receivables 9.5 9.5 28.3 56.5 289.0 648.5 1,022.3 On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 demand 3 months months years 5 years Total Receivables as at 31 March 2016 m m m m m m Non-cancellable leases 15.9 47.8 252.7 629.0 945.4 Trade and other receivables 7.5 7.5 23.4 47.8 252.7 629.0 952.9 The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, including interest, at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 based on contractual undiscounted payments at the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The total contracted discounted payments are higher than the total minimum rentals receivable due to the rent receivable not including any residual values on properties at the end of the lease contract.
In practice, the Group expects a significant renewal of leases at the end of the lease term.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups cash deposits and, as debt is utilised, long-term debt obligations.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using fixed rate debt, or by interest rate swaps, for the majority of loans and borrowings although the Group will accept some exposure to variable rates where deemed appropriate and restricted to one third of the loan book.
The swaps are revalued to their market value by reference to market interest rates at each balance sheet date.

Capital risk The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may make disposals, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital structure with reference to LTV, which is calculated as net debt divided by total property.
The LTV percentage on this basis is 37% at 31 March 2017 30% at 31 March 2016.
Commitments At the year end the Group had seven 2016: two committed developments of which six were on site with a contracted total expenditure of 39.7 million 2016: 13.5 million of which 15.9 million 2016: 8.5 million had been expended.
