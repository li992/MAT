JPM Mercantile pp46 63 05 04 2017 08:51 Page 46 Financial Statements continued Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st January 2017 1.
Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including FRS 102 Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in November 2014.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The disclosures on going concern on page 31 of the Directors Report form part of these financial statements.
The policies applied in these financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preceding year, except for the following matters: In March 2016, the FRC published amendments to FRS 102 concerning the fair value hierarchy disclosures.
These amendments are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2017.
Full disclosure is given in note 23 on pages 56 to 57. b Valuation of investments The Company has chosen to adopt Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments.
The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
The portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are treated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Accounting for reserves Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, realised gains and losses on cash and short term deposits, realised gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, management fee and finance costs allocated to capital and any other capital charges, are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and dealt with in capital reserves within Losses gains on sales of investments based on the carrying value at the previous balance sheet date.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and dealt with in capital reserves within Net movement in investment holding gains and losses.
d Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Special dividends are looked at individually to ascertain the reason behind the payment.
This will determine whether they are treated as income or capital.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premiums or discounts on purchase, are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Underwriting commission is recognised in revenue where it relates to shares that the Company is not required to take up.
46 JPM Mercantile pp46 63 05 04 2017 08:51 Page 47 Financial Statements continued Where the Company is required to take up a proportion of the shares underwritten, the same proportion of commission received is deducted from the cost of the shares taken up, with the balance taken to revenue.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue with the following exceptions: The management fee is allocated 30% to revenue and 70% to capital, in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
Expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise brokerage commission and stamp duty.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 11 on page 52. f Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
Finance costs are allocated 30% to revenue and 70% to capital, in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
g Financial instruments Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash including demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value as well as cash equivalents.
Liquidity funds are considered cash equivalents as they are held for cash management purposes as an alternative to cash.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value, with debtors reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debenture in issue is classified as a financial liability at amortised cost.
It was initially measured at the proceeds net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The amortisation of direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective interest rate method.
Bank loans are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
They are initially measured as proceeds and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Interest payable on the bank loan is accounted for on an accruals basis in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprises forward exchange contract, the purpose of which is to manage currency risk arising from the Companys investing activities.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
h Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or recovered.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences, but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
i Value Added Tax VAT Expenses are disclosed inclusive of the related irrecoverable VAT.
Recoverable VAT is calculated using the partial exemption method, based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.
j Functional currency The Company is required to identify a functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented.
The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 47 JPM Mercantile pp46 63 05 04 2017 08:51 Page 48 Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued j Functional currency continued Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in Investment holding gains and losses for investments still held at year end, and in Gains and losses on sales of investments for investments sold during the year.
k Dividends payable Dividends are included in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
l Repurchase of ordinary shares for cancellation The cost of repurchasing ordinary shares including the related stamp duty and transactions costs is charged to Capital reserves and dealt with in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of Called up share capital and into Capital redemption reserve.
m Repurchase of shares into Treasury The cost of repurchasing shares into Treasury, including the related stamp duty and transaction costs is charged to Capital reserves and dealt with in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Where shares held in Treasury are subsequently cancelled, the nominal value of those shares is transferred out of Called up share capital and into Capital redemption reserve.
Should shares held in Treasury be reissued, the sales proceeds will be treated as a realised profit up to the amount of the purchase price of those shares and will be transferred to capital reserves.
The excess of the sales proceeds over the purchase price will be transferred to share premium.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Companys financial statements on occasion requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the primary financial statements and the accompanying disclosures.
These assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in the current and future periods, depending on circumstance.
The Directors do not believe that any significant accounting judgements or estimates have been applied to this set of financial statements, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge in the year 2017 2016 000 000 Overseas withholding tax 183 282 Total tax charge for the year 183 282 b Factors affecting the total tax charge for the year The tax charge for the year is lower 2016: lower than the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 20.00% 2016: 20.16%.
The factors affecting the total tax charge for the year are as follows: 2017 2016 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 49,479 32,364 81,843 49,862 164,236 214,098 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax of 20.00% 2016: 20.16% 9,896 6,473 16,369 10,052 33,110 43,162 Effects of: Non taxable scrip dividends 20 20 121 121 Non taxable UK dividends 8,714 8,714 9,520 9,520 Non taxable overseas dividends 2,056 2,056 1,277 1,277 Non taxable capital gains 9,044 9,044 35,755 35,755 Unrelieved expenses 894 2,571 3,465 866 2,645 3,511 Overseas withholding tax 183 183 282 282 Total tax charge for the year 183 183 282 282 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 43,633,000 2016: 43,081,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 17% 2016: 18%.
The UK Government announced in July 2015 that the corporation tax rate is set to be cut to 19% in 2017 and 18% in 2020.
In March 2016 a further cut to 17% in 2020 was announced.
These reductions in the standard rate of corporation tax were substantively enacted on 15th September 2016 and became effective from 1st January 2017.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the financial statements.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

The fourth quarterly dividend declared in respect of the year ended 31st January 2016 amounted to 12,474,000.
However, the amount paid amounted to 12,422,000 due to share repurchases after the balance sheet date but prior to the share register record date.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 102 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio and derivative financial instruments.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: 1 The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for an identical asset in an active market.
Quoted in an active market in this context means quoted prices are readily and regularly available and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted price is usually the current bid price.
2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable i. e. : developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly When quoted prices are unavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset provides evidence of fair value as long as there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant lapse of time since the transaction took place.
If the entity can demonstrate that the last transaction price is not a good estimate of fair value e. g. because it reflects the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distress sale, that price is adjusted.
56 JPM Mercantile pp46 63 05 04 2017 08:51 Page 57 Financial Statements continued 3 Inputs are unobservable i. e. for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability If the market for the asset is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, an entity estimates the fair value by using a valuation technique.
The objective of using a valuation technique is to estimate what the transaction price would have been on the measurement date in an arms length exchange motivated by normal business considerations.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 46.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 102 hierarchy at 31st January.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company has no significant direct exposure to foreign exchange risk.
A proportion of the dividends received by the Company are paid in currencies other than sterling.
Therefore a significant movement in exchange rates could impact the portfolio yield, however the Board considers this to be a relatively low risk.
The Company Secretary, in close co-operation with the Board and the Manager, co-ordinates the Companys risk management strategy.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policiescontinued The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in UK equity shares and other securities, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: cash held within a liquidity fund: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a debenture issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and derivatives, the purpose of which is to effect changes in the level of the Companys gearing.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises two elements interest rate risk and market price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these two elements of market risk is given in parts i and ii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits, the liquidity fund and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when interest rates are reset.
There is no fair value interest rate risk attached to the Companys fixed rate debenture in issue, as it is carried in the financial statements at amortised cost.
Management of interest rate risk Liquidity and borrowings are managed with the aim of increasing returns to shareholders.
The Companys gearing policy is to limit gearing within the range of 10% net cash to 20% geared where gearing is defined as investments expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
Interest rate exposure The two series of debentures issued by the Company both carry fixed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
This debenture stock is carried in the Companys Statement of Financial Position at amortised cost rather than fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the share price and discount which is not likely to be material.
The Company has no significant holdings of fixed interest rate securities whose fair value would be affected by interest rate movements.
The exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset, is shown below: 2017 2016 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash at bank and short term deposits 38,295 162,719 JPMorgan Sterling Liquidity Fund 99,763 99,925 Total exposure 138,058 262,644 Interest receivable on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2016: same.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a1% 2016: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.

ii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 31st January comprises its holdings in total investments as follows: 2017 2016 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,787,131 1,775,622 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 14 to 18.
This shows that the majority of the investments value is in the UK.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2016: 10% in the fair values of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities, adjusting for changes in the management fee but with all other variables held constant.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policiescontinued b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements and to gear the Company as appropriate.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2017 More than Three three months months but not more More than or less than one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Securities purchased awaiting settlement 2,261 2,261 Repurchase of the Companys own shares awaiting settlement 7,254 7,254 Other creditors and accruals 186 186 1 Debenture stock interest 5,441 5,441 10,882 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year 2 Debenture stock principal 178,850 178,850 1 Debenture stock interest 136,306 136,306 15,142 5,441 315,156 335,739 2016 More than Three three months months but not more More than or less than one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Securities purchased awaiting settlement 8,198 8,198 Other creditors and accruals 292 292 1 Debenture stock interest 5,441 5,441 10,882 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year 2 Debenture stock principal 178,850 178,850 1 Debenture stock interest 147,188 147,188 13,931 5,441 326,038 345,410 1 The liabilities shown above represent future contractual payments and therefore differ from the amounts shown in the statement of Financial Position.
2 Includes 3,850,000 4.25% debenture stock which is irredeemable and secured by a floating charge over the assets of the Company.
The outflow of cash in connection with the debenture stock could occur earlier if the Company were to repurchase debentures for cancellation or if the Company goes into default and the security is enforced.
60 JPM Mercantile pp46 63 05 04 2017 08:51 Page 61 Financial Statements continued c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash and cash equivalents Counterparties are subject to regular credit analysis by the Manager and deposits can only be placed with counterparties that have been approved by JPMAMs Counterparty Risk Group.
The Board regularly reviews the counterparties used by the Manager.
At the year end a cash balance of 29.5 million was placed with BRED Banque Populaire and a cash balance of 7.7 million was placed with Crdit Agrlcole, in line with the Boards concentration guidelines.
The JPMorgan Sterling Liquidity Fund has a AAA rating.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase Bank is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The custody agreement grants a general lien over the securities credited to the securities account.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chase Banks own trading assets and are therefore protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase Bank were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given to investors on the protection of all of the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position under debtors and cash and cash equivalents represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value or the Statement of Financial Position amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value except for the debenture stock which the Company has in issue.
The fair value of this debenture stock has been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using the yield on a similarly dated gilt plus a margin based on the five year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.

The Boards gearing policy is to operate within a range of 10% net cash to 20% geared in normal market conditions.

This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the opportunity for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the level of dividend distributions in excess of that which is required to be distributed.
Subsequent events The Directors have evaluated the period since the year end and have not noted any subsequent events.
