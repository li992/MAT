The carrying amounts of software are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
Goodwill and other intangible assets excluding software, which include the Groups acquired brands, all have indefinite useful lives and are subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequent testing if there are indicators of impairment.
The method used is as follows: intangible assets including goodwill are allocated to appropriate cash-generating units CGUs based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows independently in relation to the specific intangible goodwill.
the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined through value-in-use calculations that use cash flow projections from approved budgets and plans over a period of five years which are then extrapolated beyond the five year period based on estimated long-term growth rates.
As the Groups other intangible assets, which represent brand values, and goodwill have all arisen from previous business combinations, CGUs have been identified as the business units acquired, as they represent the smallest group of assets which independently generate cash flows.
This is the case for all intangible assets and goodwill other than the Beauty division and Greece acquired brands where the CGU has been identified as the overall operating unit.
The table below summarises the allocation of goodwill and other intangible assets to each CGU.

PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2017 67 Key assumptions in the budgets and plans include future revenue volume price growth rates, associated future levels of marketing support, cost base of manufacture and supply and directly associated overheads.
These assumptions are based onhistorical trends and future market expectations specific to each CGU and the markets and geographies in which each CGUoperates.
Other key assumptions applied in determining value-in-use are: long-term growth rate cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rate applicable for the geographies in which the CGUs operate: and discount rate the discount rate is based on a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for comparable companies operating in similar markets and geographies as the Group as the base discount rate, adjusted for risks specific to each CGU.
The long-term growth rates and discount rates applied in the value-in-use calculations have been set out below: Long-term Discount growth rate rate Original Source 2.5% 7.5% Beauty division brands 2.5% 7.5% Raffertys Garden 2.5% 7.0% Nutricima 7.0% 16.0% five:am 2.5% 7.0% Greece 1.0% 12.5% The discount rates disclosed above are the pre-tax discount rate applied in the value-in-use calculations.
Discount rates have been used which reflect the similar geographic and product diversification within each CGUs market and the similar risks associated with each CGU.
The discount rates applied in the value-in-use calculations for Nutricima, Greece, Raffertys Garden and five:am reflect the specific economic and political risks associated with those CGUs.
Long-term growth rates have been set for each CGU based on estimated long-term growth rates for the territories in which theCGUs operate.
All CGUs, other than Nutricima, operate in geographies which include the UK, Australia, the USA and central Europe.
Long-term growth rates have been set with reference to long-term inflation forecasts which have been deemed an appropriate proxy for long-term growth.
The long-term growth rate for the Nutricima CGU reflects the estimated long-term growth rate in the key geographies of Nigeria and Ghana in which the CGU operates and, consistent with the other CGUs, has been set with reference to long-term inflation forecasts.
Having performed the annual impairment tests, no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 May 2017 31 May 2016: nil.
As part of forming this conclusion the Directors performed a sensitivity analysis which focused on the change required in key assumptions, both individually and through dual assumption sensitivities, to give rise to an impairment, with the conclusion that no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets to be less than the carrying value.
