Strategic report STRATEGIC REPORT COPPER COPPER In Chile, we have interests in two major copper operations: a 50.1% interest in the Los Bronces mine, which we manage and operate, and a 44% share in the Collahuasi mine: we also manage and operate the El Soldado mine and Chagres smelter 50.1% interest in both.
In Peru, we have an 81.9% interest in the Quellaveco project.

16% PREDICTING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE Although the area around the mine is semi-arid, the glaciers found there are natural stores of water that influence the run-off of mountain rivers, especially during the dry season.
Understanding the effects of mining and climate change on the hydrological cycle within this area is important, both for operations and the communities located downstream.
Once a robust and accurate climate model had been established, scenarios were run up to the years 2030, 2040 and beyond.
Specific weather parameters were fed into the model to understand the effects of temperature and rainfall changes over time at different altitudes, and how they could potentially affect geomorphology, air emissions, natural hazards and water availability and security.
Los Bronces 50.1% As understanding the potential physical and social owned in the Chilean impacts of climate change on our mining operations Predictions for rain, snowfall, snow melt and glacial Andes is one of the worlds great copper and host communities is of material importance to meltwater were all linked to how they influence water mines.
In collaboration AngloAmerican, we have been working with the security, and are now factored into the water balance with prominent specialists, we have UK Met Office to understand which of our operations of the mines catchment area.
These climate variability developed a climatewould be most at risk from these impacts.
This work findings will feed into Los Bronces life of mine plan, scenario model, which highlighted two countries where risk is significant Peru including closure and post-closure of the mine, to better is being fed into a life of mine plan designed and Chile.
As a result, a state of the art climate modelling inform planning decisions.
The recent drought from to make the operation analysis was carried out for the Los Bronces district to 2012-2015, and the subsequent high precipitation events more climate-resilient.
better understand the potential impacts of climate in 2016, highlight the potential value of these models in change and prepare appropriate adaptation strategies.

4 44% share of Collahuasi production, sales and financials.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW At Collahuasi, Anglo Americans attributable share of copper production was 230,500 tonnes, an increase of Underlying EBITDA increased by 67% to $1,508 million 3% 2016: 222,900 tonnes.
It was another year of record 2016: $903 million, primarily as a result of a 27% increase copper in concentrate production for the operation, building in the average LME copper price, as well as a continued on 2016s record output.
Production benefited from higher focus on cost-reduction initiatives.
Production increased to grades, as well as strong sustained plant performance 579,300 tonnes, with solid performances at Los Bronces following the completion of a two-month planned and Collahuasi partly offset by the impact of lost production maintenance at the processing plant in the second quarter.
at El Soldado, owing to the temporary suspension of mining C1 unit costs were 113 c lb 2016: 111 c lb, with the operations in the first half.
At 31December 2017, 108,000 increase in production and continued cost-saving initiatives tonnes of copper were provisionally priced at 328 c lb.
partly offsetting the effects of the stronger Chilean peso, cost inflation and lower by-product credits.
MARKETS Production at El Soldado decreased by 14% to 40,500 2017 2016 tonnes 2016: 47,000 tonnes, owing largely to the Average market price c lb 280 221 temporary suspension of mine operations from 18 February Average realised price c lb 290 225 to 28 April 2017, which resulted in 6,000 tonnes of lost production.
C1 unit costs increased by 27% to 233 c lb The differences between market price and realised price 2016: 184 c lb as a result of the lower output, the stronger are largely a function of the timing of sales across the year Chilean peso and cost inflation.
The increase in price in 2017 reflects improved demand and OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK a slowdown in mine supply, stimulating more favourable investor sentiment.
Production in 2018 is expected to increase with the planned mining of higher ore grades at Collahuasi and Los Bronces.
F or more information, refer to the Marketplace review section See pages 11-13 Production guidance for 2018 has been tightened to 630,000-660,000 tonnes.
OPERATING PERFORMANCE At Los Bronces, production in 2017 increased marginally to 308,300 tonnes 2016: 307,200 tonnes.
Higher grades 2017: 0.71% vs 2016: 0.67% were partly offset by lower throughput, following a failure in the ball mill stator at the processing plant during the third and fourth quarters.
C1unit costs increased by 8% to 169 c lb 2016: 156 c lb, reflecting the effect of the stronger Chilean peso and cost inflation.
