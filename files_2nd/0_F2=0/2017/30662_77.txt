Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
For deferred share awards granted as part of an annual performance award, the expense is recognised over the period from the start of the performance period to the vesting date.
For example, the expense for awards granted in 2017 in respect of 2016 performance, which vest in 2018-2020, is recognised as an expense over the period from 1 January 2016 to the vesting dates in 2018-2020.
For all other awards, the expense is recognised over the period from the date of grant to the vesting date.
For equity-settled awards, the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options at the date of grant, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, pro tability and growth targets.
The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a binomial option pricing model.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Forfeitures prior to vesting attributable to factors other than the failure to satisfy a non-market vesting condition are treated as a cancellation and the remaining unamortised charge is debited to the income statement at the time of cancellation.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Cash-settled awards are revalued at each balance sheet date and a liability recognised on the balance sheet for all unpaid amounts, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to staff costs in the income statement until the awards are exercised.
Where forfeitures occur prior to vesting that are attributable to factors other than a failure to satisfy market-based performance conditions, the cumulative charge incurred up to the date of forfeiture is credited to the income statement.
The Company records the value of the equity-settled awards as a deemed investment in subsidiaries.
Any revaluation related to cash-settled awards is recorded as an amount due from subsidiary undertakings.
The Group operates a number of share-based arrangements for its executive directors and employees.
Details of the share-based payment charge are set out below.

Since approval, it has been used to deliver various types of share awards: Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards: granted with vesting subject to performance measures.
Performance measures attached to awards granted previously include: total shareholder return TSR : return on equity RoE with a common equity tier 1 CET1 underpin: strategic measures: earnings per share EPS growth: and return on risk-weighted assets RoRWA.
Each measure is assessed independently over a three-year period.
Awards granted from 2016 have an individual conduct gateway that results in the award lapsing if not met Deferred awards are used to deliver the deferred portion of variable remuneration, in line with both market practice and regulatory requirements.
These awards vest in instalments on anniversaries of the award date speci ed at the time of grant.
Deferred awards are not subject to any plan limit.
This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to deferral levels, and is in line with market practice Restricted share awards, made outside of the annual performance process as replacement buy-out awards to new joiners who forfeit awards on leaving their previous employers, vest in instalments on the anniversaries of the award date speci ed at the time of grant.
This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to buy-outs, and is in line with market practice.
In line with similar plans operated by our competitors, restricted share awards are not subject to an annual limit and do not have any performance measures Underpin shares are subject to a combination of two performance measures: EPS growth and RoRWA.
The weighting between the two elements is split equally, one-half of the award depending on each measure, assessed independently.
These awards vest after three or five years.
Underpin shares formed part of the variable remuneration awarded to executive directors and senior management in respect of 2014 performance Under the 2011 Plan, no grant price is payable to receive an award.
The remaining life of the 2011 Plan during which new awards can be made is four years.

Share-based payments continued Valuation LTIP awards The vesting of awards granted in both 2016 and 2017 is subject to the satisfaction of RoE subject to a capital underpin and relative TSR performance measures and achievement of a strategic scorecard.
The fair value of the TSR component is calculated using the probability of meeting the measures over a three-year performance period, using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The number of shares expected to vest is evaluated at each reporting date, based on the expected performance against the RoE and strategic measures in the scorecard, to determine the accounting charge.
Dividend equivalents accrue on these awards during the vesting period, so no discount is applied.

Deferred shares and underpin shares accrue dividend equivalent payments during the vesting period.
The expected dividend yield assumption is based on a historical average over a period commensurate with this average period until vesting, or over one year if the average period until vesting is less than one year.
Details of deferred, underpin and LTIP awards for executive directors can be found in the Directors remuneration report.

Under the 2001 PSP half the award was dependent upon TSR performance and the balance was subject to a target of fide ned EPS growth.
Both measures used the same three-year period and were assessed independently.
2006 Restricted Share Scheme 2006 RSS 2007 Supplementary Restricted Share Scheme 2007 SRSS : The Groups previous plans for delivering restricted shares were the 2006 RSS and 2007 SRSS, both now replaced by the 2011 Plan.
There remain outstanding vested awards under these plans.
Awards were generally in the form of nil cost options and did not have any performance measures.
Generally deferred restricted share awards vested equally over three years and for non-deferred awards half-vested two years after the date of grant and the balance after three years.
No further awards will be granted under the 2006 RSS and 2007 SRSS.
All Employee Sharesave Plans comprised of the 2004 International Sharesave Plan, the 2004 UK Sharesave Plan and the 2013 Sharesave Plan : Under the All Employee Sharesave Plans, employees may open a savings contract.
Within a period of six months after the third or fifth anniversary, as appropriate, employees may purchase ordinary shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20 per cent on the share price at the date of invitation this is known as the option exercise price.
There are no performance measures attached to options granted under the All Employee Sharesave Plans and no grant price is payable to receive an option.
In some countries in which the Group operates, it is not possible to operate Sharesave plans, typically due to securities law and regulatory restrictions.
In these countries the Group offers an equivalent cash-based plan to its employees.
The 2004 International Sharesave and the 2004 UK Sharesave plans are now closed and no further awards will be granted under these plans.
The 2013 Sharesave Plan was approved by Shareholders in May 2013 and all future Sharesave invitations are made under this plan.
The remaining life of the 2013 Sharesave Plan is five years.
Valuation Sharesave: Options under the Sharesave plans are valued using a binomial option-pricing model.
The same fair value is applied to all employees including executive directors.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Standard Chartered 272 Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Directors report Risk review and Capital review FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Supplementary information 31.

The expected dividend yield is based on historical dividend for three years prior to grant.
