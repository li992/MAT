Taxation for other jurisdictions iscalculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
On 22 December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform that implements substantial changes to the federal tax system by reducing the headline federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and limiting interest deductions to a maximum of 30% of US EBITDA.
The reduction in the headline rate of tax has resulted in a revaluation of US deferred tax balances amounting to a credit of $59.3 million.
Additionally, the Group has re-measured a deferred tax asset relating to financing costs from prior years amounting to a charge of $54.5 million together with a current year charge of $22.3 million.
Finally, the tax reform introduced a tax on repatriation of profits of overseas subsidiaries resulting in a charge of $3 million.
The net impact of this tax reform $20.5m charge has been reflected in the continuing exceptional and other items tax result so as to reflect the underlying effective tax rate on a consistent basis to prior periods.

116 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows and reflects aggregated CGUs: 2017 2016 $m $m Flight Support: Signature Flight Support 1,058.3 1,048.7 ASIG discontinued operations 70.6 Aftermarket Services: Engine Repair & Overhaul Ontic 68.3 65.2 Total goodwill from continuing and discontinued operations 1,126.6 1,184.5 Total goodwill from continuing operations 1,126.6 1,113.9 Total goodwill from discontinued operations 70.6 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has determined the recoverable amount of each CGU from value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and detailed financial projections for the next four years, as approved by management, with a terminal growth rate after four years.
The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
Key assumptions The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows.
Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the four years covered by managements detailed plans Sales volumes are based on industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates, including forecasts for Business & General Aviation B&GA flying hours, aircraft engine cycles and military spending.
Selling prices and cost increases are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market.
The extent to which these assumptions affect each principal CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.
Signature Flight Support and Engine Repair & Overhaul ERO both operate in the B&GA market.
Signature Flight Support is the worlds largest and market-leading Fixed Base Operation FBO network for business aviation providing full services support for B&GA travel, focused on passenger handling and customer amenities such as refuelling, hangar and office rentals, and other technical services.
ERO is a leading independent engine repair service provider to the B&GA market with strong relationships with all major engine OEMs.
Ontic operates in the military and commercial sectors and is the leading provider of high-quality, cost-effective solutions in the continuing support of maturing aerospace platforms to the major aerospace OEMs and airframe operators.
In B&GA, growth is measured principally in relation to B&GA flying hours.
Over the longer term, the key drivers for B&GA remain intact continued growth in GDP and total wealth, the increasing value of peoples time, corporate confidence and corporate activity levels all point to improving sentiment.
The unusual nature of the 20072009 crisis and the halting return to growth have meant that, although corporate profits have recovered and confidence has improved, flight activity has lagged.
However, steady growth in US GDP and the current upward trend in US business confidence supports a continued increase in B&GA movements in the USA with the FAA currently forecasting an average growth in B&GA Jet and Turboprop flying hours of 2.5% per annum to 2037.
The political environment in the USA could also be positive in the short and medium-term, with commentators speculating that the new US tax policy could be marginally beneficial to jet purchases.
Trends in military aviation are likely to improve as the global defence market recovers after years of pressure due to budget retrenchment.
The perceived and continuing threat environment and regional tensions are expected to be the biggest driver of spending.
US defence spending represents approximately 34% of global spending and this grew in 2017 driven by the new administrations focus on strengthening the nations military.
The USA accounts for 26% of the global military aviation fleet c13,800 aircraft.
Budget growth and a higher tempo of military operations are expected to positively impact flight activity and thus maintenance spend as more missions are executed.
Life extension programmes continue to be important as the US military aircraft ages.
Military legacy aircraft life extensions of between seven and ten years on platforms such as the C-130, ACV-8B, F-15 and AH-64 and delays on new aircraft, such as the F-35 and A400M are key drivers for our Ontic business.
The current US Air Force fleet is more than 25 years old on average, with some platforms significantly older.
Average age is expected to continue to rise despite the large defence budget increases.

The business assets were impaired in 2016 based on the fair market value established in that disposal process, see note 25.
157 Accounting Policies of theCompany In relation to Signature Flight Support and Ontic, management has concluded that for these CGUs no reasonably foreseeable change in the 159 Notes to the Company key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

173 Five Year Summary The ERO trading conditions remained challenging during 2016, with no recovery in legacy mid-cabin fixed wing and rotorcraft flying visible for 174 Alternative Performance the engine platforms on which ERO operates.
This, coupled with continued pressure on pricing and workscopes, led to another disappointing Measures ERO result.
Engine trading was much reduced and that, together with further margin pressure arising from OEM actions, and reduced 179 Shareholder Information demand for lease engines, was only partially offset by the limited cost savings delivered through the footprint restructuring programme and additional cost reduction actions.
As a result of this performance and with no visible recovery in legacy mid-cabin fixed wing and rotorcraft flying, an impairment review was carried out at 30 June 2016 for both the DAI and H S CGUs within the ERO business.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were consistent with the 2016 year end goodwill impairment test, with the exception of discount rates which were adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU but had not already been reflected in the future cash flows for that CGU.
Full detail of the assumptions used in the ERO impairment test are set out in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.

Facility A was a short-term bridge to disposal facility which was fully repaid on 30 June 2016 from the proceeds of $187 million from the disposal of the FBO bases as part of the requirements of the U. S. Department of Justice under the terms of the regulatory approval following the acquisition of Landmark Aviation.
The balance of the proceeds of $37 million were used to prepay part of Facility B under the requirements of the loan documentation.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had $500 million of US private placement senior loan notes outstanding with $400 million accounted for at fair value through profit and loss as the fair value interest rate risk has been hedged from fixed to floating rates.
The remainder is accounted for at amortised cost.
Under IFRS hedge accounting rules the fair value movement on the loan notes is booked to interest and is offset by the fair value movement on the underlying interest rate swaps.
The Group includes the fair value gain on the interest rate swaps in relation to the loan notes within net debt so that the net effect is to show the $500 million US private placement at face value and to reflect the fact that the liabilities will be in place until maturity.

These companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group and premiums paid are held to meet future claims.
The cash balances held by these companies are reported on the balance sheet within cash and cash equivalents.
As is usual practice for captive insurance companies, some of this cash is used as collateral against contingent liabilities standby letters of credit that have been provided to certain external insurance companies.

97 Consolidated Balance Sheet Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity 98 Consolidated Cash Flow risk.
Overall, the risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seek to manage and minimise Statement potential financial risks through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which 99 Consolidated Statement there is no underlying financial exposure.
of Changes in Equity Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
This 100 Accounting Policies of theGroup department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with Group subsidiary companies.
The treasury policies cover specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of 107 Notes to the Consolidated Financial excess liquidity.
These policies are outlined on page 36.
Statements Capital risk management 155 Company Balance Sheet The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return 156 Company Statement of to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash Changes in Equity equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
157 Accounting Policies of The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from theCompany the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
159 Notes to the Company Financial Statements The Group is subject to two financial covenant requirements within its borrowing facilities: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.5x and minimum net interest cover of 3.0x based on EBITDA.
The borrowing facilities permit the use of an acquisition spike which allows for 166 Subsidiaries and Related the maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA covenant to be 4.0x for two test periods following the activation of the acquisition spike.
The Undertakings acquisition spike was activated in February 2016 so the higher test applied for the testing periods ending June 2016 and December 2016.
173 Five Year Summary The maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA covenant reverted back to 3.5x for the testing period ending June 2017.
The Group complied 174 Alternative Performance with these covenants during the year.
Measures Market risk 179 Shareholder Information Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well-defined policies for the management of these risks which includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
i Foreign exchange risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency in which the operations are located.
The Groups policy in relation to foreign exchange translation risk is not to hedge the income statement since such hedges only have a temporary effect.
In relation to the balance sheet, the Group seeks to denominate the currency of its borrowings in US dollars in order to match the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets, which are principally denominated in US dollars.
As at 31 December 2017, the majority of the Groups net borrowings were denominated in US dollars as set out below: 2017 US dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 95.9 19.1 27.9 10.6 153.5 Borrowings and finance leases 1,320.2 0.7 3.2 1,324.1 Net borrowings per the Balance Sheet 1,224.3 18.4 24.7 10.6 1,170.6 2016 US dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 136.8 15.5 22.2 8.0 182.5 Borrowings and finance leases 1,548.2 0.8 0.4 1,549.4 Net borrowings per the Balance Sheet 1,411.4 14.7 21.8 8.0 1,366.9 130 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Within the Groups definition of net debt the US Private Placement USPP is included at its face value of $500 million 2016: $500 million reflecting the fact that the liabilities will be in place until maturity.
This is $2.2 million 2016: $7.3 million lower than the carrying value, adjusted for the deduction of debt issuance costs.
The net carrying value as at 2017 was $502.2 million 2016: $507.3 million.
The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each foreign exchange policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and where significant foreign currency exposures exist then generally a percentage of the projected foreign currency flows are covered, depending on the certainty of these cash flows.
The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting regular reports to Group Treasury which detail the foreign currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with significant foreign exchange transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash flows over the life of the policy.
The predetermined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure which needs to be hedged.
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contract s will be undertaken by Group Treasury on behalf of the relevant subsidiary with the Groups relationship banks.

A gain of $2.2 million 2016: gain of $4.5 million has beentransferred to the income statement.
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through theBBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to $11.1 million 2016: $34.6 million have been transferred to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year.
Thenetimpact on the Groups result for the period is immaterial, since the balances which these contracts relate to have had a similarbut opposite effect on administrative expenses.
ii Interest rate risk The Groups borrowings are funded through a combination of bank debt and capital markets borrowings.
The Groups bank debt is funded through floating rate debt which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups capital markets borrowings are financed through US private placement fixed rate debt which exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy in relation to interest rate risk specifies the portion of its debt obligations, which should be fixed through the use of fixed rate debt and or interest rate swaps, based on the debt maturity profile and an assessment of interest rate trends.

The Group has designated $626.6 million 2016: $1,045.0 interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of which $nil 2016: $150 million are forward starting interest rate swaps and the fair value loss of $1.7 million 2016: gain of $5.4 million has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
A charge of $4.0 million 2016: charge of $7.3 million has been booked against hedged interest payments made in the period.
As detailed in note 16, $400 million of the $500 million US dollar private placement loan notes included within borrowings above have been adjusted by fair value changes due to interest rate risk, as this has been hedged using interest rate swaps converting fixed interest to floating interest rates.
The fair value loss of $4.3 million on the swaps has been recognised in the income statement 2016: loss of $3.8 million which has been offset by the fair value gain on the related fixed rate debt of $4.3 million 2016: gain of $3.8 million.
This has also been booked to the income statement and the net impact is immaterial.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, aswell as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As part of the Groups operations, cash management and risk management activities, the Group is exposed to counterparty risk arising on the financial assets held by the Group and the credit risk on outstanding derivative financial instruments.
132 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Treasury-related credit risk The Group aims to reduce counterparty risk by dealing with counterparties with investment grade ratings, as measured by financial credit rating agencies.
All treasury related activity is concentrated with relationship banks that provide unsecured committed facilities to the Group.
Across the subsidiaries, wherever possible and where services can be provided efficiently and cost-effectively, bank accounts, surplus cash and any hedging activity are concentrated and undertaken with relationship banks.
Each counterparty that the Group uses for derivatives, bank account activity and the investment of surplus cash is assigned a maximum credit limit dependent upon the counterpartys credit rating.
This limit gives a maximum permitted amount of cash and derivatives that can be held or undertaken with each counterparty.
Deposits are generally for short-term maturity of less than three months.
As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the Group had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
These exposures are continually monitored and reported and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
No significant losses are expected to arise from non-performance by these counterparties.
Commercial-related credit risk The Groups exposure to commercial-related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables and the amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Sales to customers are settled in a number ofdifferent ways including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods.
A customer or potential customer is assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether credit terms will be provided.
The Group does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for, as shown in note 12.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity requirements through the use of short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition to strong cash generation in the businesses the Group maintains unsecured committed borrowing facilities from a range of banks to mitigate this risk further.
Headroom on our facilities is regularly evaluated and consistently monitored to ensure that the Group has adequate headroom and liquidity.
The table in note 16 provides a breakdown of the Groups committed borrowing facilities.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: fair value interest rate swaps are assumed to be fully effective and therefore there is no impact on the income statement or balance sheet from changes in interest rates: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges areassumed to be recorded fully within other comprehensive income: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, cash and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the Income Statement: the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the interest rate affects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: the sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances of the Company only as at the balance sheet date and assumes this is the position for a full 12-month period: the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by approximately 10% per annum: and the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used due to the fact that historically floating US dollar interest rates have moved by on average 1% per annum.
134 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Income Statement and within other comprehensive income that would result from reasonably possible movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, before the effects of tax.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was $9.7 million 2016: $13.1 million of which $6.2 million 2016: $8.9 million was in respect of schemes outside the United Kingdom.
This includes $8.9 million 2016: $10.9 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs and defined benefit obligation are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme, the BBA Income and Protection Plan IPP, with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to the IPP are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
As required by UK pension law, there is a board of Trustees that, together with the Group, is responsible for governance of the IPP.
During 2008, the Trustees of the UK defined benefit plan purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities associated with pensioner members.
Since the initial buy-in, further tranches of annuities have been purchased periodically in respect of new pensioner liabilities, although there have been no new tranches purchased during 2016 or 2017.
The annuity is an investment of the UK plan, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the plan.
The income from the annuity matches the payments to be made to the pensioner members it covers and removes mortality risk in relation to those members which are the subject of the annuity purchase.
The fair value of the annuity policy has been set equal to the present value of the related benefit payments.
The Company closed the IPP to future accrual with effect from 31 May 2016 after consultation with members.
On this date, all active members became deferred and their pension increases in future will be linked to deferred revaluations.
The actuarial valuation of the IPP as at 31 March 2015 indicated a funding deficit of 44.5 million $66million at rate as at 31 March 2015.
As agreed with the Trustees of the IPP, BBA will make deficit contribution payments to the IPP of 0.3million per annum in addition to the Asset-Backed Funding payments set out below to meet the costs of running the IPP.
At the time the funding plan was agreed, if the assumptions made are borne out in practice the funding deficit will be eliminated by 31 March 2034.
The next actuarial valuation is due as at 31 March 2018, at which point the funding deficit and funding plan will be reviewed.
During the year the Company has appointed a sole professional trustee.
This decision was taken to improve scheme governance, enable more efficient and quicker decision making, and reduce costs.
The sole trustee continues to act on behalf of the scheme members.
The US Minimum Funding actuarial valuation for the BBA retirement plan as at 1 January 2017 indicated a funding deficit of $3.2 million.
As required by US law, BBA will make contribution payments that are in excess of the minimum required contribution amounts.
The next actuarial valuation is due as at 1 January 2018.
During the first half of 2014, the Group agreed a new long-term funding package with the Trustee of the IPP, following the sale of APPH Limited.
As part of this funding package, an Asset-Backed Funding ABF structure was put in place, which entitles the Trustee to receive payments of 2.7 million each year until 2034.
In addition, the Group made an additional payment of 4.2 million in January 2015.
The ABF structure consists of a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP, formed between two newly incorporated subsidiaries of the Group and the Trustee of the IPP.
The SLP has a long-term inter-company loan receivable due from Ontic Engineering & Manufacturing UK Limited Ontic UK, on which annual interest payments of 2.7 million are due over the term of the loan.
The SLP will make quarterly profit distributions of the interest payments received from Ontic UK to the IPP, totalling 2.7 million per annum.
The Trustee of the IPP acquired its interest in the SLP via an in-specie contribution from BBA.
The ABF structure has been established so that the three newly created entities are consolidated into the Groups financial statements.
In addition, the interest in the SLP held by the IPP is not treated as an asset under IAS 19, and therefore is not included as part of the Groups pensions disclosures under IAS 19.
Instead, the payments due to the IPP are treated as a series of payments which the Group has committed to make.
The split of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 is approximately 45% in respect of deferred members and 55% in respect of pensioner members.
The weighted average duration of the IPPs liabilities is approximately 15 years.

This Plan has been included in the consolidated accounts within this report with effect from 5 February 2016.
The Company and Income Trustee agreed to merge the assets and liabilities of the NEA Scheme into the IPP, with an effective date of 31 December 2017.
This decision 97 Consolidated Balance was taken to reduce running costs of two separate plans and improve overall efficiency.
Members in the NEA Scheme will continue to receive Sheet the same benefits following the merger.
The Groups foreign pension schemes all in North America mainly relate to a funded defined benefit 98 Consolidated Cash Flow pension arrangement.
Statement There is also a post-retirement medical plan and a deferred compensation plan.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified 99 Consolidated Statement actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
of Changes in Equity During December 2017, the main US plan undertook a bulk transfer exercise, extinguishing the liabilities for a number of members of the 100 Accounting Policies of theGroup scheme.
In total, $8.6 million of assets were transferred out of the scheme, with a corresponding decrease in the IAS 19 liabilities as at 31 December 2017 of $10.7 million.
107 Notes to the Consolidated Financial In accordance with IAS 19, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and Statements healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2017.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have 155 Company Balance Sheet been adopted: 156 Company Statement of United Kingdom North America Changes in Equity 2017 2016 2017 2016 157 Accounting Policies of Per annum % theCompany Discount rate 2.35 2.5 3.5 4.1 159 Notes to the Company Rate of increase to pensionable salaries Financial Statements Price inflation 3.1 3.2 2.3 2.3 166 Subsidiaries and Related Undertakings Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.0 3.1 2.3 2.3 173 Five Year Summary IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used to discount the liability be determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high- 174 Alternative Performance Measures quality corporate bond investments.
The currency and terms of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.
The discount rate for the UK Plans have been derived using a yield curve approach.
The yield curve is based on 179 Shareholder Information the yield available on sterling AA rated corporate bonds of a term similar to the liabilities.
The RPI assumption for the UK Plans allow for the shape of the inflation spot curve and the duration of the Plans liabilities.
A deduction of 30 basis points has been made to the breakeven inflation assumption to allow for an inflation risk premium.
For the UK Plans, the mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within the plan, and a best estimate view of future mortality improvements.
The life expectancy assumptions applying to the IPP as at 31 December 2017 are as follows: 2017 2016 Male Female Male Female Life expectancy for a current 65-year-old years 22.0 24.1 22.1 24.3 Life expectancy for a 65-year-old in 15 years years 23.2 25.7 23.5 26.2 For the US post-retirement medical plan, the immediate trend rate for medical benefits was 8.50% which is assumed to reduce by 0.5% per annum to 4.5% in 2026 onwards.

The value of these annuities has been calculated as being equivalent to the value of the pensioner liabilities which they match, using the same actuarial assumptions used to calculate the corresponding element of the DBO.
The purpose of the annuity is to help reduce asset liability mismatch risk.
The remainder of the assets of the UK Plan are invested in a range of funds with different risk and return profiles, with equities being the next largest asset class held after the insurance contract.
The objective of the remainder of the portfolio is to generate excess returns, in order to partially fund the UK Plan through asset performance.
To the extent that actual investment returns achieved are lower than those assumed, then this may result in a worsening of the funding position and higher future cash contribution requirements for the Group.
This is particularly the case in respect of the proportion of the assets held within equity instruments.
The assets of the US Plans are invested in a range of funds with different risk and return profiles.
The risks inherent in the investment strategy for these Plans is similar to the risks posed by the investment strategy for the UK Plans, albeit they are smaller in magnitude given the size of the US Plans relative to the UK Plans.

The impact of the tax reform has meant a re-measurement of a deferred tax asset related to financing costs from prior years amounting to a charge of $54.5 million reflected in continuing operations, whilst additionally the reduction in the headline rate of tax has resulted in a revaluation of US deferred tax attributes amounting to a credit of $58.1 million.
The net impact of this tax reform $3.6 million credit has been reflected in the exceptional and other items tax result continuing $4.8 million credit and discontinued $1.2 million charge.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has gross temporary differences and tax losses of $1.6billion 2016: $1.2 billion available for offset against future profits for which deferred tax has not been recognised.
These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be accurately predicted at this time.
Included in the unrecognised gross temporary difference is $nil 2016: $9.5 million relating to losses due to expire in 2020 which relates to losses that will expire by 2020.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely under current tax legislation.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities could arise but have not been recognised is $nil 2016: $13.0 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
