Reclassifications of financial instruments During the year ended 31 March 2009 the group reclassified certain financial instruments out of fair value through profit or loss.
These assets were originally classified as held-for-trading but the group's intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group reclassified 112.3 million and 7.8 million to the loans and receivables and available-for-sale classifications, respectively.
Theamount reclassified reflected the fair value of the financial assets at the date of reclassification.
The group did not undertake any further reclassifications under the amendment to IAS 39 in the current year and in the prior year.

In the current year the reclassified assets have contributed a 0.1 million loss through the margin line and a gain of 0.4 million through impairments before taxation.
In the prior year, after reclassification, the assets contributed a 0.2 million loss to through the margin line and a gain of 22.3 million through impairments before taxation.

Fair value hierarchy The following table analyses recurring fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities.
These fair value measurements are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
The different levels are identified as follows: Level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Fair value disclosures on investment properties are included in the investment properties note 32 on page 232.

Fair value hierarchy continued In determining the value of level 3 financial instruments, the following are the principal inputs that can require judgement: Credit spreads Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument.
The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.
In general, a significant increase in a credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of a financial instrument.
It is an unobservable input into a discounted cash flow valuation.
Discount rates Discount rates are the interest rates used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow valuation method.
The discount rate takes into account time value of money and uncertainty of cash flows.
Volatilities Volatility is a key input in the valuation of derivative products containing optionality.
Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given derivative underlying.
It represents an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time.
Volatilities are a key input into the Black-Scholes valuation method.
Cash flows Cash flows relate to the future cash flows which can be expected from the instrument and require judgement.
Cash flows are input into a discounted cash flow valuation.
Price earnings multiple The price-to-earnings ratio is an equity valuation multiple used in the adjustment and underlying market prices.
It is a key driver in the valuation of unlisted investments.
EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.
This is the main input into a price earnings multiple valuation method.

This assumption also applies to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity which are included in customer accounts deposits and variable rate instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing spreads earned on the transactions with spreads earned on similar new transactions entered into by the group.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows, using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
For quoted sub-debt issued, the fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.
Certain financial instruments that would normally be carried at fair value continue to be recognised at transaction price.
This occurs when the fair value would normally be determined using valuation techniques which cannot be relied on due to insufficient external inputs.
This results in gains or losses which have not been recognised on balance sheet.

Other assets Calculation of the present value of future cash flows, discounted as appropriate.
Deposits by banks Calculation of fair value using appropriate funding rates.
Customer accounts deposits Where the deposits are short-term in nature, carrying amounts are assumed to approximate fair value.
Where deposits are of longer-term maturities, they are valued using a cash flow model discounted as appropriate.
Debt securities in issue Where the debt securities are fully collateralised, fair value is equal to the carrying value.
Other debt securities are valued using a cash flow model discounted as appropriate to the securities for funding and interest rates.
Other liabilities Where the other liabilities are short term in nature, carrying amounts are assumed to approximate fair value.
Subordinated liabilities Valued with reference to market prices.

Derivative financial instruments The group enters into various contracts for derivatives both as principal for trading purposes and as customer for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
These include financial futures, options, swaps and forward rate agreements.
The risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored in the same manner as for the underlying instruments.
Risks are also measured across the product range in order to take into account possible correlations.
In the tables that follow, notional principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument represents the positive or negative cash flows which would have occurred had the rights and obligations arising from that instrument been closed out by the group in an orderly market transaction at the balance sheet date.

The effective tax rate is lower in 2017 than in 2016.
The main reason for this is because of utilisation of losses in 2017 that have not been previously recognised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is likely that profits will arise in future periods.
The assessment of the likelihood of future profits is based on past performance and current projections.
Deferred taxation assets are not recognised in respect of capital losses and excess management expenses as crystallisation of capital gains and the eligibility of potential losses is uncertain.
There are trading losses carried forward of 216.1 million 2016: 189.4 million, capital losses carried forward of 41.9 million 2016: 27.4 million and excess management expenses of 9.5 million 2016: 11.4 million on which deferred tax assets have not been recognised due to uncertainty regarding future profits against which these losses can be utilised.
The Finance Act 2015 reduced the main rate of corporate taxation to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017.
In addition, the bank corporation tax surcharge of 8% effective from 1 January 2016 was enacted in November 2015.
On 16 March 2016, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a further reduction of the corporation tax rate to 17% effective from 1 April 2020.
The effect of these legislative changes is reflected in the above calculation of the deferred taxation asset as the rate was substantially enacted before 31March 2017.

Fair value hierarchy Investment properties For all investment properties that are measured at fair value, the current use of the property is considered the highest and best use.
Properties are valued under the income capitalisation method or discounted cash flow method DCF.
Under the income capitalisation method a propertys fair value is estimated based on the normalised net operating income generated by the property, which is divided by the capitalisation rate.
Under the DCF method, a propertys fair value is estimated using explicit assumptions about the benefits and liabilities of ownership over the assets life including an exit or terminal value.
This involves the projection of a series of cash flows and to this: an appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of the income stream.
Valuation techniques used to derive level 3 fair values For all classes of investment property, the significant unobservable inputs listed below are used in the income capitalisation method to determine the fair value measurement at the end of the reporting period.
Significant unobservable Relationship between unobservable inputs and fair value measurement inputs Expected rental value ERV Increases decreases in ERV would increase decrease estimated fair value.
Equivalent yield Increases decreases in the equivalent yield would result in decreases increases in the estimated fair value.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on expected cash flows within the cash-generating units of the group to which the goodwill is allocated.
Key assumptions within the calculation include discount rates, growth rates in revenue and related expenditure and loan impairment rates.
Discount rates are based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market conditions, adjusted for the specific risks associated with the cash-generating unit.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Cash flow forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year and are extrapolated for a period of three to five years, adjusted for expected future events.
The two most significant cash-generating units giving rise to goodwill are Investec Asset Management and Investec Wealth & Investment IWI which now includes the business of Williams fide Bro acquired in 2012 as part of the Evolution Group which was merged with IWI in August 2012.
For Investec Wealth & Investment, goodwill of 236.3 million has been tested for impairment on the basis of the cash flow projections for the next three years discounted at 8.8% 2016: 8.9% which incorporate an expected revenue growth rate of 2% in perpetuity 2016: 2%.
The valuation is based on value in use of the business.
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out and it has been concluded that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause an impairment to be recognised.
For Investec Asset Management, goodwill of 88.0 million has been tested for impairment on the basis of a valuation of the business based on 3% of funds under management.
The valuation is based on managements assessment of appropriate external benchmarks to estimate the fair value less cost to sell business.
Valuing an asset management business as a percentage of funds under management, taking into account asset mix, is in line with market practice and the percentage used by management reflects external transactions that are comparable to Investec Asset Management.
The valuation would be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Movement in goodwill 2017 An impairment of 3.1m was recognised in relation to a historic acquisition in the Specialist Banking businesses, due to a change in the nature of the ongoing business.
2016 There were no significant movements in goodwill during the prior year.

The majority of the schemes are defined contribution schemes with the exception of two schemes in the United Kingdom being the Guinness Mahon Pension Fund scheme GM scheme and the Investec Asset Management Pension scheme IAM scheme.
Both schemes are final salary pension plans with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plan is subject to UK regulations, which require the trustees to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the plan.
The role of the trustees is to ensure that the schemes are administered in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interest of all members and beneficiaries.
The trustees are solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial valuation process.
The schemes are closed to new members and the accrual of service ceased on 31 March 2002.
The schemes have been valued at 31 March 2017 by qualified independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19.
There were no unpaid contributions in relation to the defined contribution schemes outstanding at the year end.
"In November 2016, the trustees of the GM scheme entered into a ""buy-in"" insurance agreement with Aviva Annuity UK Ltd ""Aviva""."
As a result Aviva provide the accrued pension benefits of members of the scheme, as the previous assets held in the scheme are now replaced by this insurance agreement.
As a result the group has reduced its exposure to the risks associated with the scheme.
The administrative transition between the scheme trustees and Aviva is ongoing.

The specific mortality rates used are based on the S1PA base tables with allowance for future improvements in line with CMI 2014 core projections and a long term improvement of 1.25% per annum.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: Years Years Male aged 65 88.4 88.3 Female aged 65 91.0 90.9 Male aged 45 90.2 90.1 Female aged 45 92.9 92.8 Sensitivity analysis of assumptions The sensitivities are only presented for the GM scheme as the equivalent increases decreases in assumptions for the IAM scheme do not have a material impact.
If the discount rate was 0.25% higher lower, the scheme liabilities would decrease by approximately 6 801 000 increase by 7284000 if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
If the inflation assumption was 0.25% higher lower, the scheme liabilities would increase by approximately 3 047 000 decrease by 2 877 000.
In this calculation all assumptions related to the inflation assumption have been appropriately adjusted, that is the salary, deferred pension and pension in payment increases.
The other assumptions remain unchanged.
If the salary increase assumption was 0.25% higher lower, the scheme liabilities would increase by approximately 274000 decrease by 269000 if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
If the deferred revaluation assumption was 0.25% higher lower the scheme liabilities would increase by 890000 decrease by 872000 if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
If the pension increases assumptions were 0.25% higher lower, the scheme liabilities would increase by approximately 2426000 decrease by 2296000 if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
If life expectancies were to increase decrease by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by approximately 6257000 decrease by 5455000 if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the relevant assumption would occur in isolation, holding other assumptions constant.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the same methodology that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
Risk exposures A description of the risks which the pension schemes expose Investec can be found in the risk management report on page 103.
The group ultimately underwrites the risks relating to the defined benefit plans.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, the group will need to make further contributions to the plans.

None of the group's own assets or properties occupied or used by the group held within the assets of the scheme.
The investment strategy previously in place for the GM scheme was to switch to gilts over the period to 31 March 2021.
At31March 2016, the allocation of the GM scheme's invested assets was 100% to gilts and cash, ahead of the investment strategy.
The higher allocation was due to additional switches from equities to gilts during the first and third quarter of 2013 under the agreed outperformance trigger mechanism.
However, as set out above during the year to 31 March 2017 the trustees have converted to a buy-in insurance agreement.
Details of the investment strategy can be found in the GM scheme's Statement of Investment Principles, which the Trustees update as its policy evolves.
The Trustee's current investment strategy is to strike a balance between maximising the returns on the scheme's assets and minimising the risks associate with lower than expected returns.

The triennial funding valuation of the schemes was carried out as at 31 March 2015.
Contributions requirements, including any deficit recovery plans, were agreed between the group and the Trustees in March 2013 and March 2016 to address the scheme deficit.
Under the agreed contribution plan deficit contributions of 4.0 million were paid into the GM scheme in the year to March 2017 and the group will make an additional contribution to the GM scheme in the 2017 18 financial year when the finalisation of the transfer of the administration from the trustees to Aviva is completed.
The IAM scheme is fully funded.

The group makes awards available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time, depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the groups share price.
At present, the practice of the group is to grant all permanent staff members a share allocation, based on their annual package, after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff, these share awards vest over periods varying from four to five years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance and contribution made by the respective staff members.

Financial services compensation scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS, the UKs statutory fund of last resort, provides compensation to customers of UK authorised financial institutions in the event that an institution which is a participating member of the FSCS is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises annual levies from participating members based on their level of participation in the case of deposits, the proportion that their protected deposits represent to total protected deposits as at 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year.
Following the default of a number of deposit takers in 2008, the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury to fund the compensation costs for customers of those firms.
Although the majority of this loan is expected to be repaid from funds the FSCS receives from asset sales, surplus cash flow or other recoveries in relation to the assets of the firms that defaulted, any shortfall will be funded by deposittaking participants of the FSCS.
Investec Bank plc is a participating member of the FSCS and the bank has accrued 1.4 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS.
The accrual is based on estimates for the interest the FSCS will pay on the loan and estimates of the level of the banks market participation in the relevant periods.
Interest will continue to accrue to the FSCS on the HM Treasury loan and will form part of future FSCS levies.
At the date of these financial statements, it is not possible to estimate whether there will ultimately be additional levies on the industry, the level of Investecs market participation or other factors that may affect the amount or timing of amount that may ultimately become payable, nor the effect that such levies may have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Legal proceedings Investec operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to litigation risks.
As a result, Investec is involved in disputes and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which Investec is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
These claims, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Specifically, a claim has been made in the Royal Court of Guernsey against ITG Limited, a subsidiary of Investec plc, for breach of equitable duty for skill and care with a related claim for liability for the debts of a client trust.
These claims are currently the subject of appeals before the Judicial committee of the Privy Council.
The outcome of these claims cannot reasonably be estimated at this time but Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of the proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the group.

Hedges The group uses derivatives for the management of financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with non-trading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the Central Treasury in the Specialist Bank.
Once aggregated and netted, Central Treasury, as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, Central Treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and non-trading interest rate risk within defined parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependent on the classification between fair value hedges and cash flow hedges and, in particular, accounting hedges require the identification of a direct relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedges achieved by the group.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments attributable to interest rates.

Trading liabilities and trading derivatives have been included in the 'Demand' time bucket and not by contractual maturity because trading liabilities are typically held for short periods of time.

Consolidated structured entities Investec plc has no equity interest in the following structured entities which are consolidated.
Typically, a structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control.
The judgements to assess whether the group has control over these structures include assessing the purpose and design of the entity, considering whether the group or another involved party with power over the relevant activities is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.

Investec plc silo excluding Investec Limited annual financial statements 2017 253 Annual financial statements Notes to the annual 04 financial statements continued 53.
Principal subsidiaries and associated companies Investec plc continued The key assumptions for the main types of structured entities which the group consolidates are summarised below: Securitised residential mortgages The group has securitised residential mortgages in order to provide investors with exposure to residential mortgage risk and to raise funding.
These structured entities are consolidated due to the groups holdings of equity notes combined with its control over servicing activities.
The group is not required to fund any losses above those incurred on the notes it has retained: such losses are reflected in any impairment of securitised mortgages as those assets have not been derecognised.
Structured debt and loan portfolios The group has structured debt and loan portfolios for the purpose of issuing asset-backed securities.
These structured entities are consolidated due to the groups retention of equity notes and because it continues to act as the collateral manager.
The group is not required to fund any losses above those incurred on the notes it has retained.
Structured commercial real estate loan assets The group has securitised a number of commercial real estate loan assets.
These structured entities are consolidated as the group has retained all of the notes issued.
The group continues to recognise the commercial real estate loan assets on its balance sheet.
Securitised receivables The group has securitised portfolios of medium-term lease and hire purchase receivables.
These structured entities are consolidated as the group has retained the equity notes and control over servicing activities.
Other structured entities commercial operations The group also consolidates a number of structured entities where control arises from rights attached to lending facilities and similar commercial involvement.
These arise primarily in the areas of aircraft funds, where the group has rights which allow it to maximise the value of the assets held and investments in mining projects due to its exposure to equity like returns and ability to influence the strategic and financial decision-making.
The group is not required to fund any losses above those which could be incurred on debt positions held or swaps which exist with these structured entities.
The risks to which the group is exposed from these structured entities are related to the underlying assetsheld in the structures.
The total assets held in structured entities arising from commercial operations is 130.0 million 2016:231.1 million.
Significant restrictions As is typical for a large group of companies, there are restrictions on the ability of the group to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of the group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries.
These are considered below: Regulatory requirements Subsidiary companies are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated.
These require entities to maintain minimum capital, leverage and exposure ratios restricting the ability of these entities to make distributions of cash or other assets to the parent company.
Regulated subsidiaries of the group are required to maintain liquidity pools to meet PRA and local regulatory requirements.
The main subsidiaries affected are: Investec Bank plc, Investec Bank Channel Islands Limited and Investec Bank Switzerland AG, which must maintain compliance with the regulatory minimum.
Capital management within the group is discussed in the risk management report on page 104.
254 Investec plc silo excluding Investec Limited annual financial statements 2017 Annual financial statements Notes to the annual financial statements 04 continued 53.
Principal subsidiaries and associated companies Investec plc continued Statutory requirements The groups subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally maintain solvency.
These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to remit dividends, except in the case of a legal capital reduction or liquidation.
Contractual requirements Asset encumbrance the group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks.
Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the group.
The assets typically affected are disclosed in notes 19 and 56.
Structured associates The group has investments in a number of structured funds specialising in aircraft financing, where the group acts as adviser or fund manager in addition to holding units within the fund.
As a consequence of these roles and funding, the group has significant influence over the fund and therefore the funds are treated as associates.
The group applies the venture capital exemption to these holdings and, as such, the investments in the funds are accounted for at fair value and held within the investment portfolio on the balance sheet.

Unconsolidated structured entities The table below describes the types of structured entities that the group does not consolidate but in which it holds an interest and originally set up.
In making the assessment of whether to consolidate these structured entities, the group has concluded that it does not have control after consideration in line with the accounting policies as set out on page 158.

The table below sets out information in respect of structured entities that the group sponsors, but in which the group does not have an interest.
Structured entities with no interest held 2017 2016 Structured CDO and CLO Structured CDO and CLO securitisations securitisations Why it is considered a structured entity This is a CDO and CLO securitisation This is a CDO and CLO securitisation where Investec has no continuing interest where Investec has no continuing interest as the notes previously held have been as the notes previously held have been redeemed or fully written off.
The entity is redeemed or fully written off.

Income amount and type Nil Nil Carrying amount of all assets transferred 222 million of CDO and CLO assets 222 million of CDO and CLO assets Interests in structured entities which the group has not set up Purchased securitisation positions The group buys and sells interest in structured entities that it has not originated as part of its trading activities, e. g. residential mortgage securities, commercial mortgage securities, loans to corporates and resecuritisations.
In such cases, the group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of its trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.
Details of the value of these interests is included in the risk management report on page 83.
