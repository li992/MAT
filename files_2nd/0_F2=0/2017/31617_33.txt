190 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation Overview This section sets out the Groups accounting policies that relate to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
This section also shows new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, relevant to the Group, and whether they are effective in 2017 or later years.
We explain how these changes are expected to impact the financial position and performance of the Group.
1.1 General information The Company is a public company limited by shares, incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and registered in England and Wales.
The consolidated financial statements comprise those of the Company and its controlled entities, together the Group.
1.2 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, investment properties, financial assets available for sale and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1.3 Presentation of risk offsetting and maturity disclosures Certain disclosures required under IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures and IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements have been included within the audited sections of the Risk report.
Where information is marked as audited, it is incorporated into these financial statements by this cross reference and it is covered by the Independent auditors report.
1.4 Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic report.
In addition, the Risk report includes the Groups risk management objectives and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital.
In assessing the Groups going concern position as at 30 September 2017, the Directors have considered a number of factors, including the current balance sheet position, the principal and emerging risks which could impact the performance of the Group and the Groups strategic and financial plan which includes future projections of profitability, capital adequacy, liquidity and funding.
The assessment concluded that, for the foreseeable future, the Group has sufficient capital to support its operations: has a funding and liquidity base which is strong, robust and well managed with future capacity: and has expectations that performance will continue to improve as the Groups strategy is executed.
As a result of the assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and therefore believe that the Group is well placed to manage its risks successfully in line with its business model and strategic aims.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
1.5 Basis of consolidation Controlled entities are all entities including structured entities to which the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
An assessment of control is performed on an ongoing basis.
Controlled entities are consolidated from the date on which control is established by the Group until the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations other than those under common control.
A noncontrolling interest is recognised by the Group in respect of any portion of the total assets less total liabilities of an acquired entity or entities that is not owned by the Group.
Post-acquisition, income received and expenses incurred by the entity or entities acquired are included in the consolidated income statement on a line by line basis in accordance with the accounting policies set out herein.
Balances and transactions between entities within the Group and any unrealised gains and losses arising from those transactions are eliminated in full upon consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 191 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation continued 1.6 Foreign currency Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling GBP, which is also the Groups presentation currency, rounded to the nearest million pounds sterling m unless otherwise stated.
Transactions and balances The Group records an asset, liability, expense or revenue arising from a transaction using the closing exchange rate between the functional and foreign currency on the transaction date.
At each subsequent reporting date, the Group translates foreign currency monetary items at the closing rate.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation or settlement of monetary items are recognised in the income statement during the year in which the gains or losses arise.
Foreign currency non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated at the date of the transaction, with those measured at fair value translated at the date when the fair value is determined.
Foreign exchange differences are recognised directly in equity for non-monetary items where any component of associated gains or losses is recognised directly in equity.
Foreign exchange differences arising from non-monetary items, whereby the associated gains or losses are recognised in the income statement, are also recognised in the income statement.
1.7 Financial assets and liabilities Recognition and derecognition A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Purchases and sales of financial assets classified within fair value through profit or loss are recognised on trade date.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Group has discharged its obligation to the contract, or the contract is cancelled or expires.
Offsetting This can only occur, and the net amount be presented on the balance sheet, when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
1.8 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosed amount of contingent liabilities.
Assumptions made at each balance sheet date are based on best estimates at that date.
Although the Group has internal control systems in place to ensure that estimates can be reliably measured, actual amounts may differ from those estimates.
The Group considers the most significant use of accounting estimates and judgements relate to the following areas: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss note 3.3 : impairment provisions on credit exposures note 3.6 : deferred tax note 3.11 : PPI redress provision and other conduct related matters note 3.14 : and retirement benefit obligations note 3.16.
192 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information 1.9 New accounting standards and interpretations The Group has adopted the following International Accounting Standards Board IASB pronouncements in the current financial year.
Except where otherwise stated, these did not have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation, issued May 2014 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
IAS 16 and IAS 38 both establish the principle for the basis of depreciation and amortisation being the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of an asset.
This amendment provides clarification that the use of certain revenue based methods to calculate depreciation is not appropriate.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2012-2014 Cycle, issued September 2014 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
The IASB has made amendments to the following standards that are relevant to the Group: IFRS 5: Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations: IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures: IAS 19: Employee Benefits: and IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.
amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative, issued December 2014 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
This includes a narrow scope amendment providing clarification to existing IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements requirements.
New accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments issued July 2014 and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued September 2015 are both effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and have been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016 and is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and has been endorsed by the EU.
Separate updates on the Groups implementation of these new standards can be found at the end of this section.
There are a number of other standards and amendments that are either not available for adoption in the EU or are otherwise not mandatory at 30 September 2017 and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements.
The pronouncements, while relevant to the Group, are not anticipated to have a material impact and include: 1 amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses, issued in January 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The amendments clarify the requirements on the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses: 1 amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure initiative, issued in January 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The amendments to IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows require disclosures that enable users of the financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from an entitys financing activities: 2 amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions, issued in June 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The amendments provide guidance on the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments: classification of share-based payments with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations: and accounting for modifications to a share-based payment that change the classification from cash-settled to equity-settled: 2 amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation, issued in October 2017 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The amendments allow companies to measure particular prepayable financial assets with so-called negative compensation at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income if a specified condition is met, instead of at fair value through profit or loss: 2 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle, issued December 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017 or 1 January 2018.
The IASB has made amendments to the following standards: IFRS 12: Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities clarification of the scope of the standard effective 1 January 2017, and IAS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures measuring an associate or joint venture at fair value effective 1 January 2018 : 2 IFRIC interpretation 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration, issued December 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The new interpretation provides requirements on which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions such as revenue transactions when payment is made or received in advance: and 2 IFRIC interpretation 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, issued June 2017 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The new interpretation applies to any situation in which there is uncertainty as to whether an income tax treatment is acceptable under tax law and is not limited to actual ongoing disputes.
2 Not yet endorsed by the EU.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 193 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation continued 1.9 New accounting standards and interpretations continued Updates on the implementation of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments, IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16: Leases The Group continues to assess the requirements of these Standards as it seeks to ensure that the methodology and approach to the key impacts and challenges of the Standards result in a high quality implementation, while continuing to recognise emerging and evolving industry practice.
IFRS 9 CYBG implementation strategy and approach IFRS 9 was endorsed for adoption in the EU in November 2016 and will be adopted by the Group with effect from 1 October 2018.
Classification and measurement IFRS 9 changes the classification of financial assets by reducing the number of categories to just three amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI and fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
The final classification is based on a combination of the Groups business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments.
The option to designate a financial asset at FVTPL in IAS 39 is largely retained in IFRS 9, with IFRS 9 also affording a further option to designate certain equity instruments at FVOCI instead of accounting for these as FVTPL.
The Group has undertaken an assessment to determine the potential impact of these changes.
These are unlikely to result in significant changes to existing measurement bases: however, the final impact will be dependent on the circumstances prevailing on 1 October 2018.
Impairment overview The Groups IFRS 9 implementation programme is progressing as planned with models built and an end-to-end parallel run exercise to commence during the year beginning 1 October 2017.
As expected, there will be a period of refinement required where the series of complex decisions, judgements and assumptions made, particularly in relation to the Groups model methodology, that will be reviewed, sufficiently tested and benchmarked.
It is only after a period where the testing environment has stabilised, that the results of the parallel run will provide an indication of the likely impact.
The Groups approach to the new expected credit loss ECL methodology in IFRS 9 will leverage, as far as possible, off the model development work that has been undertaken to support the Groups IRB accreditation application.
A lifetime ECL calculation will be required for scenarios where the credit quality of a financial asset has been identified through the Groups staging criteria as having significantly deteriorated since original recognition.
The Groups 12 month and lifetime ECL calculation will be based around a PD x EAD x LGD formula: Term Defined as To be IFRS 9 compliant PD Probability of default PD is an estimate of the Forward-looking 12 month and lifetime PD, probability that a customer will default which needs to be capable of reflecting changes in the economic environment EAD Exposure at default EAD is an estimate of the Forward-looking and based on contractual limits amount the customer will owe at the time of default with certain exceptions for revolving products such as credit cards that may contain both a drawn and undrawn element LGD Loss given default LGD is an estimate of the loss Forward looking with no prescribed floors that the Group will suffer if the customer defaults incorporating any collateral held 194 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information There are a number of specific key elements to the IFRS 9 ECL calculation which require the Group to define and articulate the direction it will take in meeting these that is ensuring that the ECL calculation is forward-looking and encompasses a probability weighted multiple scenario approach.
The Group currently adopts economic scenario methodology for capital planning and credit stress testing purposes and views the introduction of the IFRS 9 requirements as an extension to these established processes.
The Group will align the specific requirements of IFRS 9 to these to ensure a consistent approach is adopted.
The exact nature and number of the economic scenarios including the necessary economic inputs required for the scenarios, along with their relevant probability weightings, were finalised following experienced credit judgement, discussion and agreement with stakeholders.
This will be subject to refinement as the parallel run period progresses.
The adoption of IFRS 9 may result in an increase in the Groups balance sheet provisions for credit losses and may therefore have a negative impact on the Groups regulatory capital position.
Hedge accounting Macro hedge accounting is being considered in a separate IASB project.
There is an option available to retain the existing IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements until the completion of the macro hedge accounting project.
The Group proposes to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 in accordance with this option.
Regulatory capital The Group notes the pronouncements regarding transitional relief for the likely regulatory capital impact of adopting IFRS 9 from the Basel Committee and also the European Parliament and Commission and will continue to monitor the regulatory landscape over the year ahead in the lead up to the Groups adoption of IFRS 9 for final details on the regulatory capital treatment of the change to an ECL methodology.
The Group will consider the option of spreading the effect of the change to an ECL methodology for regulatory capital purposes should this feature in the finalised version of the rules.
IFRS 15 IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and endorsed for use in the EU in September 2016.
It is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and it will be adopted by the Group with effect from 1 October 2018.
The Standard is unlikely to have a significant impact as the majority of the Groups income is generated from financial instruments and is therefore not in scope of the Standard.
For those revenues that are in scope typically fees and other commissions, the Group continues to assess the related performance obligations to identify any fees or other commissions that may require a change in recognition.
The Group continues to assess the new disclosure requirements of the Standard.
IFRS 16 IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and endorsed for use in the EU.
It is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019, and will be adopted by the Group with effect from 1 October 2019.
The Group continues to work on and assess the new estimates and judgements required by the Standard and their implications.
Operating leases will be brought onto the Group balance sheet with an asset recognised for the contractual right of use and a liability recognised for the contractual payments.
The Group expects this work to progress throughout the 2018 reporting period.

CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 197 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.2 Net interest income Accounting policy Interest income is reflected in the income statement using the effective interest method which discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, cash flows are estimated considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument e. g. prepayment, call and similar options excluding future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate such as transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Where it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument or group of financial instruments, the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument or group of financial instruments are used.
Loan origination and commitment fees are recognised within the effective interest rate calculation.
Non-utilisation of a commitment fee is recognised as revenue upon expiry of the agreed commitment period.
Loan related administration and service fees are recognised as revenue over the period of service.
Interest income and interest expense on hedged assets and liabilities and financial assets and liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss are also recognised as part of net interest income.
Where a trading derivative is economically hedging an interest-bearing financial asset or liability designated at fair value through profit or loss, the interest income and expense attributable to the derivative is recognised within net interest income and not as part of the fair value movement of the trading derivative.

The fair value of these loans is derived from the future loan cash flows using appropriate discount rates and includes adjustments for credit risk and credit losses.
The valuation technique used is reflective of current market practice: and hedged assets, liabilities and derivatives designated in hedge relationships fair value movements are recognised on both the hedged item and hedging derivative in a fair value hedge relationship the net of which represents hedge ineffectiveness, and hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedge relationships note 3.4.
Fees and commissions Where not integral to the effective interest rate, these are recognised on an accruals basis as the services are provided or on completion of the underlying transaction.

By virtue of its 3.24% shareholding in VocaLink, the Group received cash consideration of 25m.
The resulting gain of 20m, which was recognised in the available for sale reserve following the acquisition announcement in 2016, was recycled to the income statement and is included within Gains on disposal of available for sale financial assets in the current year.
CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 199 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.4 Operating and administrative expenses Accounting policy Personnel expenses primarily consist of wages and salaries, accrued bonus and social security costs arising from services rendered by employees during the financial year.
The Group recognises bonus costs where it has a present obligation that can be reliably measured.
Bonus costs are recognised over the relevant service period required to entitle the employee to the reward.

2.5 Taxation Accounting policy Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it is related to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Disallowable expenses represent, in the main, the Groups share of incremental conduct charges that are not deductible in computing taxable profits.
The Conduct indemnity adjustment represents the receipt from payment to the Groups former parent less refunds attributable in accordance with the indemnity agreement note 3.14.
The rate at which deferred tax is recognised in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme has changed due to the closure of the Scheme.
The surplus is accounted for as a potential refund to the employer, not a reduction in future contributions.
In accordance with tax legislation this authorised surplus payment is recognised as a deferred tax liability at 35%.
There is an overall rate change in respect of the pension of 37m with 30m taken to the income statement and 7m to the statement of other comprehensive income.
2.6 Earnings per share EPS Accounting policy Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent company and dividing this by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share This requires the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to be adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These arise from awards made under equity based compensation schemes.
Share awards with performance conditions attaching to them are not considered to be dilutive unless these conditions have been met at the reporting date.
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings loss per share data in relation to the ordinary shares of CYBG PLC.

3.2 Financial assets available for sale Accounting policy Available for sale financial assets are recognised on trade date and comprise listed and unlisted non-derivative financial assets not classified into any other financial asset category.
They are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included as a separate component of equity until sale or impairment, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
All available for sale financial assets are continually monitored for evidence of any impairment, which would typically be deemed to have arisen where there is evidence of a significant or prolonged reduction in the fair value of the security below its cost.
Where such evidence of impairment exists, the cumulative net loss previously recognised directly in equity is transferred to the income statement.
In situations where evidence suggests a subsequent increase in value, reversals of impairment of previously impaired equity instruments are recognised directly in equity: reversals of impairment of debt instruments are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income, determined using the effective interest method, is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses and translation differences on monetary items are recognised in the income statement within the year in which they arise.

CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 203 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.3 Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Accounting policy Financial assets and liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement as they arise note 2.3, when this reduces an accounting mismatch or where the performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
In such cases, transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement upon initial recognition of the financial asset and liability.
The derivatives related to the assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting and are accounted for as held for trading derivative financial instruments note 3.4.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models.
The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where such data is not available, judgement is required to establish fair values.
The judgements include considerations of liquidity and model inputs.
The most significant judgement is in relation to the Groups fair value loan portfolio.
The most significant input impacting the carrying value of the loans other than interest rates is the future expectation of credit losses.
Sensitivity analysis indicating the impact of reasonably possible changes in this input on the fair value is provided in note 3.18.
2017 2016 m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Loans and advances 477 750 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Due to customers term deposits 26 48 Loans and advances Included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is a historical portfolio of loans sales ceased in 2012.
Interest rate risk associated with these loans is managed using interest rate derivative contracts and the loans are recorded at fair value to avoid an accounting mismatch.
The maximum credit exposure of the loans is 477m 2016: 750m including accrued interest receivable of 2m 2016: 4m.
The cumulative loss in the fair value of the loans attributable to changes in credit risk amounts to 11m 2016: 24m and the change for the current year is a decrease of 13m 2016: decrease of 14m, of which 6m 2016: 11m has been recognised in the income statement.
The loans are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy note 3.18.
Due to customers term deposits Included in other financial liabilities at fair value are fixed rate deposits, the interest rate risk on which is hedged using interest rate derivative contracts.
The deposits are recorded at fair value to avoid an accounting mismatch.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in the Groups credit risk is Nil 2016: Nil.
The Group is contractually obligated to pay 1m 2016: 3m less than the carrying amount at maturity to the deposit holder.
The term deposits are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy note 3.18.
204 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information 3.4 Derivative financial instruments Accounting policy All derivative instruments manage exposures to interest rates and foreign currency and are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value on trade date.
The carrying value of a derivative is measured at fair value throughout the life of the contract.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The notional amount of a derivative contract is not recorded on the balance sheet but disclosed as part of this note.
The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss on a derivative depends on whether it is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Certain derivatives are designated as either hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction a cash flow hedge : or hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments a fair value hedge.
Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
Specifically, the separate component of equity note 4.1 is adjusted to the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument, and the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future cash flows on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge.
Any remaining gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is not adjusted.
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value hedge The carrying value of the hedged item on initial designation is adjusted for the fair value attributable to the hedged risk.
Subsequently, changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The movement in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is made as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability.
Where the hedged item is derecognised from the balance sheet, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability is immediately transferred to the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is amortised to the income statement on an effective interest basis over the remaining life of the asset or liability.
Hedge effectiveness The Group documents, at the inception of a transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and the hedged items, and the Groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking these hedge transactions.
The documentation covers how effectiveness will be measured throughout the life of the hedge relationship and its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
A hedge is expected to be highly effective if the changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated are expected to offset in a range of 80% to 125%.
Derivatives held for trading The Group uses derivatives for risk management purposes and does not have a trading book.
However, derivatives that do not meet the hedging criteria within IAS 39, or for which hedge accounting is not applied, are classified as held for trading.
Changes in value of held for trading derivatives are immediately recognised in the income statement note 2.3.

The Group also cash flow hedges its foreign currency exposure on material, highly probable non-GBP denominated transactions.
The Group hedging positions also include those designated as foreign currency and interest rate hedges of debt issued from the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes respectively.
As such, certain derivative financial assets and liabilities have been booked in structured entities and consolidated within these financial statements.
Cash flow hedged derivatives include vanilla interest rate swaps within macro hedges and cross currency swaps within a structured entity.

Loans and advances to customers are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, adjusted for impairment losses.
They are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Leases entered into by the Group as lessor, where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, are classified as finance leases.
The leased asset is not held on the Group balance sheet: instead, a finance lease is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Interest income is recognised in interest receivable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.

Examples of loss events are i where there has been an actual breach of contract by the borrower such as a default or delinquency in payment of interest or principal: or ii the granting of a concession to the borrower that the Group would not otherwise consider.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists either individually for assets that are separately significant: or collectively for assets that are not separately significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment collective provisions.
Collective provisions Collective provisions are generally established for homogenous portfolios such as the Retail portfolios and the small business portfolio within the SME franchise.
Within the Groups Retail environment, past loss experience is a key factor in determining an appropriate collective provision level and takes into account a number of different elements including: the number of days past due: the realisable value of any security held: and the timing of any such security sale.
These and other factors will influence the probability that the customer defaults on the loan the PD.
In the event of a default occurrence, the Retail collective provision calculator provides the amount the Group expects to be irrecoverable from that customer the LGD.
The level and impact of LGD varies significantly between the Groups secured and unsecured lending portfolios.
Collective provisioning for the Groups SME portfolio is also based on the use of PD and LGD.
The assets are included in a group of financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.
The modelled collective assessment considers factors such as: credit quality: levels of arrears: credit utilisation: loan to collateral ratios: and other factors including the Groups internal customer rating system eCRS.
These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets as they are indicative of the borrowers ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Reliance is placed on the eCRS rating when assessing PD as these are directly mapped within the model.
Manual interventions to the eCRS rating, such as the placement on a watch list, will directly lead to an increase in PD and consequently the level of collective provision required.
LGD assumptions are driven by the level of security assigned to the customer within the collective provisioning model.
These are regularly monitored to ensure comparability with recent actual loss experience.
In addition, for both the Groups Retail and SME portfolios, experienced judgement is used to estimate the amount of an impairment loss.
This reflects a limited number of refinements that have been assessed as necessary to reflect specific and evolving circumstances that, by their nature, cannot be adequately captured in the models.
The use of judgements and supportable estimates is considered by management to be an essential part of the credit impairment process.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to identify and reduce any significant differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
Specific provision If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows including the estimated realisable value of any security discounted at the assets original effective interest rate a specific provision.
Specific provision allowances are primarily established against the Groups commercial business within the SME franchise.
Assets are reviewed on a regular basis and those showing potential or actual vulnerability are placed onto a watch list where enhanced monitoring is undertaken.
210 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Impairment When first recognised, the impairment allowance, which is a combination of both the collective and specific provision, is recognised in the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income is recognised using the original effective rate of interest which was used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
When a loan is uncollectible, and all necessary internal procedures have been completed, it is written off against the related impairment loss.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off reduce the expense in the income statement.
The Groups impairment policy for available for sale financial assets is included in note 3.2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements In determining the required level of collective impairment provisions, the Group uses the output from various statistical models, with management judgement required to assess the modelled outputs and, where necessary, make appropriate adjustments.
The key assumptions within the Groups collective provisioning models which give rise to significant estimation uncertainty are the PD and the LGD.
Both measures are predicated on expectations of customer behaviour and performance, which requires management to form a judgement based on a wide range of historic and current evidence.
The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
From an SME perspective, changes made to eCRS will have a direct impact as these are mapped to PDs.
Assumption changes on retail customer behaviour will also have an impact on the PDs used.
Within the Retail portfolio, the Groups collective provision is reflective of the fact that the majority of lending is concentrated on customer mortgages, where the available security is generally sufficient to cover the exposure.
This differs from the SME portfolio where the availability and strength of the security will have less of an impact on overall recoveries, leading to a potentially higher collective provision charge relative to the overall exposure.
Sensitivities within the collective provision There are interactions between the various assumptions within the provisioning models which mean that no single factor is likely to move independent of others: however, the sensitivities disclosed below assume all other assumptions remain unchanged.
If the PDs were to move by - 5% from those presently used within the Groups provisioning models, the impairment provision would increase decrease accordingly by 5m.
An important element to the PD is the loss emergence period LEP which represents the Groups assessment of the period from when a loss event occurs to eventual default.
The impact of the LEP differs between the Groups Retail and SME portfolios.
A two-month increase in the LEP would result in a further 2m impairment provision within the SME portfolio: and a further 1m being added to the Retail impairment provision.
To the extent that recovery rates improve from those presently used within each of the Groups provisioning models by 5%, the impairment provision on loans and advances would decrease by 14m.
Alternatively, if recovery rates deteriorate by 5%, the impairment provision on loans and advances would increase by 24m.
Provision in the SME portfolio is sensitive not only to default rates and severity of losses, but also to the assessment of risk and security.
If 10% of the SME portfolio were to fall by one notch, the impairment provision would increase by 2m.
In addition to modelled outputs, the impairment provision is further impacted by management judgements.
These include judgements that reflect elements which are not sufficiently sensitive to the current economic conditions, model risk reserves that are held to cover against a range of potential model limitations, and judgements made in respect of potential recoveries for specific provisions which also involve customer and economic specific conditions.
These management judgements do not allow for any meaningful sensitivity comparison.

3.7 Securitisation and covered bond programmes Accounting policy The Group sponsors the formation of structured entities, primarily for the purpose of facilitation of asset securitisation and covered bond transactions to accomplish certain narrow and well-defined objectives.
Although the Group has no shareholding in these entities, where it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entities and it has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity, they are regarded as controlled entities as described in note 1.5 and are consolidated in the Groups financial statements.
Securitisation The Group has securitised a proportion of its retail mortgage loan portfolio under the Groups master trust securitisation programmes.
The securitised mortgage loans have been assigned at principal value to bankruptcy remote structured entities.
These structured entities have been funded through the issue of residential mortgage backed debt to third-party institutional debt investors.
The Group is entitled to any residual income from the vehicles after the debt obligations and senior expenses of the programmes have been met.
The securitised debt holders have no recourse to the Group other than the principal and interest including fees generated from the securitised mortgage loan portfolio.
The Group continues servicing these mortgage loans in return for an administration fee.
The mortgage loans do not qualify for derecognition because the Group remains exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards of the mortgage loan portfolio, principally the associated credit risk.
The securitisation structured entities are consolidated and the securitised mortgage loans retained on the Groups balance sheet.
A liability is recognised for the proceeds of the funding transaction.
The externally held securitised notes in issue are included within debt securities in issue note 3.15.
There are a number of notes held internally by the Group, not recognised on the balance sheet, which are used as collateral for repurchases and similar transactions or for credit enhancement purposes.
Covered bond A subset of the Groups retail mortgage loan portfolio has been ring fenced and assigned to a bankruptcy remote limited liability partnership, Clydesdale Covered Bond 2 LLP, associated with the covered bond programme, to provide a guarantee for the obligations payable on the covered bonds issued by the Group.
Similar to the securitisation programmes, the Group is entitled to any residual income after all payment obligations due under the terms of the covered bonds and senior programme expenses have been met.
The mortgage loans do not qualify for derecognition because the Group retains all of the risks and rewards of the mortgage loan portfolio.
The covered bond partnership is consolidated with the mortgage loans retained on the consolidated balance sheet and the covered bonds issued included within debt securities in issue.
The covered bond holders have dual recourse: firstly, to Clydesdale Bank PLC on an unsecured basis: and secondly, to the LLP under the Covered Bond Guarantee secured against the mortgage loans.
Significant restrictions Where the Group uses its financial assets to raise finance through securitisations and the sale of securities subject to repurchase agreements, this leads to the assets becoming encumbered.
Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group.

The Group has contractual and non-contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support as follows: Securitisation programmes The Group provides credit support to the structured entities via reserve funds, which are partly funded through subordinated debt arrangements and by holding junior notes.
Exposures totalled 47m in subordinated debt 2016: 20m and 856m in junior notes held 2016: 610m.
The Group has a beneficial interest in the securitised mortgage portfolio held by the structured entities of 711m 2016: 977m.
Furthermore, the Group has an obligation to repurchase mortgage exposures if certain mortgage loans no longer meet the programme criteria.
Looking forward through future reporting periods there are a number of date based options on the notes issued by the structured entities which could be actioned by them as issuer.
These could require the Group, as sponsor, to provide additional liquidity support.
Covered bond programme The nominal level of  was 681m 2016: 599m of the outstanding covered bonds.

CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 213 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.8 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy The Groups freehold and long-term leasehold land and buildings are carried at their fair value as determined by the Directors, taking account of advice received from independent valuers.
Fair values are determined in accordance with guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, including adjustments to observable market inputs reflecting any specific characteristics of the land and buildings.
Directors valuations are performed annually in July, with the independent valuations carried out on a three-year cycle on an open market basis.
The valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in note 3.18.
All other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to acquisition of the asset.
Impairment is assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
With the exception of freehold land, all items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated or amortised using the straight line method, at rates appropriate to their estimated useful life to the Group.
The annual rates of depreciation or amortisation are: Buildings 50 years Leases leasehold improvements the lower of the expected lease term or the assets remaining useful life Fixtures and equipment 310 years Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
Depreciation is recognised within depreciation expense in the income statement.

CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 215 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.10 Intangible assets Accounting policy Capitalised software costs are stated at cost, less amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Identifiable and directly associated external and internal costs of acquiring and developing software are capitalised where the software is controlled by the Group, and where it is probable that future economic benefits that exceed its cost will flow from its use over more than one year.
Costs associated with maintaining software are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised computer software costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives, usually between three and 10 years.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, which typically arises when the benefits associated with the software were substantially reduced from what had originally been anticipated or the asset has been superseded by a subsequent investment.
In such situations, an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use.
Intangible assets which are fully amortised are reviewed annually to consider whether the assets remain in use.

216 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information 3.11 Deferred tax Accounting policy Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses and unused tax credits only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will arise against which those temporary differences and losses may be utilised.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group has deferred tax assets of 154m 2016: 183m : the reduction from the previous balance sheet date is due to the movement in the defined benefit pension scheme to a surplus and the utilisation of the capital allowance deferred tax asset.
The Group has assessed the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at 30 September 2017 and considers it probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the underlying deductible temporary differences can be utilised over the corporate planning horizon.
At 30 September 2017, the Group had an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 180m 2016: 202m representing trading losses with a gross value of 1,058m 2016: 1,186m.
Although there is no prescribed period after which losses expire, a deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as the Directors have insufficient certainty over their recoverability in the foreseeable future.

In accordance with IAS 12, these rates are taken into account in assessing the value at which assets are expected to be realised and liabilities settled.
2 2017 contains draft legislation in respect of the Corporate Tax Loss Restriction and the Corporate Interest Restriction which was due to apply from 1 April 2017.
As the legislation was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date it has not been applied in the calculation of the tax position at 30 September 2017.
Management expects that given the Groups particular asset profile in respect of losses, application of the new rules would have resulted in an immaterial increase in the deferred tax asset recognised on the balance sheet.
This is expected given that the new rules are designed to accelerate the payment of corporation tax.
The rate at which deferred tax is recognised in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme has changed due to the closure of the Scheme to the majority of members note 3.16.
The surplus is accounted for as a potential refund to the employer, rather than a reduction in future contributions.
There is an overall rate change in respect of the pension of 37m with 30m charged in the income statement and 7m charged directly to equity.

Provisions for liabilities and charges are not discounted to the present value of their expected net future cash flows except where the time value of money is considered material.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements PPI redress provision and other conduct related matters Management has exercised significant judgement around the key assumptions that underpin the estimates and used estimation techniques to quantify them.
Ongoing regulatory review and input, as well as rulings from the Financial Ombudsman Service over time, and the Groups internal reviews and assessments of customer complaints, will continue to impact upon the nature and extent of conduct related customer redress and associated costs for which the Group may ultimately become liable in future periods.
Significant judgement is required in determining the key assumptions used to estimate the quantum of the provision, including the level of future complaint volumes, uphold rates how many claims are, or may be, upheld in the customers favour, and redress costs the average payment made to customers.
Also factored into the estimate is the effect of the judgements required around the outcome of the remediation activity.
The provision is therefore subject to inherent uncertainties as a result of the subjective nature of the assumptions used in quantifying the overall estimated position at 30 September 2017, consequently, the provision calculated may be subject to change in future years if outcomes differ to those currently assumed.
Sensitivity analysis indicating the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the PPI provision is presented within this note.
There are similar uncertainties and judgements for other conduct risk related matters, however the level of liability is materially lower.

CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 219 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.14 Provision for liabilities and charges continued PPI redress In common with the wider UK retail banking sector, the Group continues to deal with complaints and redress issues arising out of historic sales of PPI.
During the year, the Group reassessed the level of provision that was considered appropriate to meet current and future expectations in relation to the mis-selling of PPI policies and concluded that a further charge of 494m was required incorporating the Groups estimate of the impact of PS17 3 issued on 2 March 2017 relating to a proposed time bar for complaints in August 2019.
It also incorporated a reassessment of the costs of processing cases and the impact of experience adjustments.
Only 9.7% of the charge impacts the Groups income statement 48m as a result of the Capped Indemnity.
The total provision raised to date in respect of PPI is 2,140m 2016: 1,646m, with 422m of this remaining 2016: 725m comprising 201m for customer initiated complaints and proactive customer contact 2016: 299m : 80m for the remediation of complaints closed prior to August 2014 2016: 257m : and 142m for costs of administering the redress programme 2016: 169m.
To 30 September 2017, the Group has received 361,000 complaints 2016: 282,000 and has allowed for 73,000 further walk in complaints.
This reflects an expectation that the volume of walk in complaints will reduce compared to most recent experience as the time bar approaches.
Future complaint volumes could differ from the Groups assumption, which could result in a further provision being required.
The Group implemented a comprehensive new PPI complaint handling process from August 2014 which involved making a number of significant changes to the PPI operations which resulted in an increase in operational and administrative costs.
As reported previously, the Group is in the process of re-opening approximately 180,000 complaints and reviewing the original decision reached in light of the new PPI complaint handling processes.
As at 30 September 2017, this exercise is approximately 83% complete.
In addition to the remediation activity described above, the Group has completed a past business review PBR of certain PPI sales, to determine if there was actual or potential customer detriment in the sales process leading to a risk of mis-sale and the potential for proactive redress.
The review indicated a more favourable outcome than allowed for in the assumptions underpinning the provision as at 30 September 2016.
The increase in provision has taken into account all of the above factors as well as a revision in the Groups expectation of new customer initiated complaints in light of current experience with the overall provision based on a number of assumptions derived from a combination of past experience, estimated future experience, industry comparison and the exercise of judgement in the key areas identified.
There remain risks and uncertainties in relation to these assumptions and consequently in relation to the ultimate costs of redress and related costs, including: i the number of PPI claims and the extent to which this is influenced by the activity of claims management companies, the application of a time bar, Plevin, and FCA advertising : ii the number of those claims that ultimately will be upheld: iii the amount that will be paid in respect of those claims: iv any additional amounts that may need to be paid in respect to previously handled claims: v the response rates to the proactive customer contact: and vi the costs of administering the remediation programme.
As such, the factors discussed above mean there is a risk that existing provisions for PPI customer redress may not cover all potential costs.
In light of this, the eventual costs of PPI redress and complaint handling may therefore differ materially from that estimated and further provision could be required.
The table below sets out the key assumptions and the effect on the provision at 30 September 2017 of future, potential, changes in key assumptions: Assumptions Change in 1 assumption Sensitivity Number of expected future customer initiated complaints 73,000 cases -10% 22m Uphold rates: Future complaints -1% 3m Pre August 2014 complaints review -1% 1m 2 Average redress costs -1% 2m 1 There are inter-dependencies between several of the key assumptions which add to the complexity of the judgements the Group has to make.
This means that no single factor is likely to move independently of others, however, the sensitivities disclosed above assume all other assumptions remain unchanged.
The sensitivities disclosed do not incorporate the impact, if any, on the administrative cost element of the provision.
2 Sensitivity to a change in average redress across customer initiated complaints, pre August 2014 complaints review and PBR customer populations.
220 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information The number of complaints received is monitored against past experience and future expectations and the Group will continue to reassess the adequacy of the provision for this matter and the assumptions underlying the provision calculation based upon experience and other relevant factors as matters develop.
Customer redress and other provisions In addition to PPI redress set out above, provision for customer redress is held in those instances where the Group expects to make payments to customers whether on an ex-gratia or compensatory basis.
Provisions can arise as a result of legal or regulatory action and can incorporate the costs of skilled persons, independent reviewers, and where appropriate other elements of administration.
The Group has reassessed the level of provision considered necessary in light of the current and future expected claims for all of these matters and concluded that no additional provisions are required to cover the expected tail of new complaints received at this stage.
Other provisions also include amounts in respect of a number of other non-PPI conduct related matters, legal proceedings, and claims arising in the ordinary course of the Groups business.
Over the course of the year, the Group has raised further provisions of 98m for these matters, but only 9.7% of the charge impacts the Groups income statement 10m as a result of the Capped Indemnity.
The ultimate cost to the Group of other customer redress matters is driven by a number of factors relating to offers of redress, compensation, offers of alternative products, consequential loss claims and administrative costs.
The matters are at varying stages of their life cycle and in certain circumstances, usually early in the life of a potential issue, elements of the potential exposure are contingent.
These factors could result in the total cost of review and redress varying materially from the Groups estimate.
The final amount required to settle the Groups potential liabilities in these matters is therefore uncertain and further provision could be required.
During the year Nil 30 September 2016: 1m was also recognised for provisions not related to customer redress conduct risk.
Conduct Indemnity Deed The Groups economic exposure to the impact of historic conduct related liabilities is mitigated by a Capped Indemnity from NAB.
The Company and NAB have an agreement under which NAB has provided the Company with a Capped Indemnity to meet the costs of dealing with conduct matters related to products sold in the period prior to the date of the Groups demerger from NAB the Conduct Indemnity Deed.
The legacy conduct matters covered by the Capped Indemnity are referred to as Relevant Conduct Matters.
The Capped Indemnity provides the Group with economic protection against certain costs and liabilities including financial penalties imposed by a regulator resulting from conduct issues relating to: a PPI, standalone interest rate hedging products, voluntary scope tailored business loans and fixed rate tailored business loans: and b other conduct matters, subject to certain limitations and minimum financial thresholds.
Amounts payable under the Capped Indemnity include, subject to certain limitations, payments to customers to satisfy, settle or discharge a Relevant Conduct Matter and the direct costs and expenses of satisfying, settling, discharging or administering such Relevant Conduct Matter.
It has been agreed that NAB will meet 90.3% of Qualifying Conduct Costs claimed by the Company, up to the amount of the Capped Indemnity.
Claims under the Capped Indemnity are recognised in the consolidated income statement simultaneously with the charge for Relevant Conduct Matters.
The conduct expense and associated reimbursement income are presented net within Other operating and administrative expenses.
A reimbursement receivable is recognised on the consolidated balance sheet within Due from other banks: this receivable is periodically settled by NAB.
The reimbursement receivable is not offset against the provision amount on the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
The provision expense and reimbursement income are disclosed above.
No reimbursement income or receivable is recognised on the consolidated balance sheet in relation to contingent liabilities for Relevant Conduct Matters.
Any possible future reimbursement income linked to contingent liabilities in respect of Relevant Conduct Matters is not disclosed as a contingent asset as the amounts cannot be reliably estimated and are not virtually certain to be received.
To the extent that it is no longer probable that provisions for a Relevant Conduct Matter previously raised will be required to settle conduct obligations and a provision for a Relevant Conduct Matter is released as unutilised, the related Capped Indemnity amounts received will become repayable to NAB.
Should the Qualifying Conduct costs exceed the Capped Indemnity, any excess cost will be borne by the Group.
To the extent that tax relief is expected in relation to provisions for which reimbursement income is applicable, amounts may become repayable to NAB.
In the consolidated financial statements, deferred tax assets are only recognised in respect of the loss share proportion 9.7% of unused tax losses on Relevant Conduct Matters, on the basis that the Group does not obtain the economic benefit of the future tax relief which is repayable to NAB.

Duration and termination The indemnity protection provided by NAB to the Company in respect of Relevant Conduct Matters under the Capped Indemnity is perpetual in nature, except in the following circumstances: a it is fully utilised by the Group: or b in the event that, at any time: i the PRA determines that NABs remaining exposure under the Capped Indemnity: or ii the Unutilised Indemnity Amount, is 100m or less, NAB will have the right with the approval of the PRA at its sole discretion to terminate the Capped Indemnity by subscribing for shares at a price equivalent to the prevailing five-day average market price for the shares in an amount equal to the Unutilised Indemnity Amount, provided that the maximum value of the shares to be subscribed for does not exceed a value equal to 9.9% of the issued share capital of the Group on an undiluted basis at such time a 100m Termination.
c NAB and the Group may also agree arrangements to terminate or replace the Capped Indemnity with the consent of the PRA.
In particular, NAB and the Group have agreed that they will, on the fifth anniversary of the demerger and, if relevant, each subsequent anniversary of the demerger, seek to agree arrangements to terminate the Capped Indemnity.
If any such arrangements are agreed between NAB and the Group, they will be required to obtain the approval of the PRA at its sole discretion before commencing the implementation of such arrangements.
In relation to proposals made by NAB to the Group in connection with such termination of the Capped Indemnity, the Group cannot unreasonably withhold its agreement to the Capped Indemnity being replaced by a payment equal to the Unutilised Indemnity Amount to be applied in whole or in part in subscribing for shares at a price equivalent to the prevailing five-day average market price for the shares, provided that the maximum value of the shares to be subscribed for pursuant to such proposal would not exceed 200m or if lower, a value equal to 9.9% of the issued share capital of the Group on an undiluted basis at such time a Post-5 Year Equity Subscription Termination.
If 100m Termination or Post-5 Year Equity Subscription Termination occurs, the Group will not be entitled to make any further claims under the Capped Indemnity, but will be entitled to retain in a designated account for a period of three years following such termination, any Unutilised Covered Amount and any amount to be withdrawn from a designated account in respect of conduct costs that fall within the scope of the Capped Indemnity which have been incurred and paid by the Group prior to such termination.
The Company will be required to return to NAB any other amounts in a designated account and to release to NAB all amounts remaining in the collateral account.
Following the expiry of such three-year period, the Group will be required to repay all remaining amounts in a designated account net of any amount to be withdrawn from a designated account in respect of conduct costs that fall within the scope of the Capped Indemnity which have been incurred and paid by Group prior to such anniversary.
Restructuring provision Restructuring of the business is currently ongoing and a provision is held to cover redundancy payments, property vacation costs and associated enablement costs.
During the year 67m 2016: 45m was charged to the income statement, of which 9m 2016: 6m was charged directly to the income statement and 58m 2016: 39m was provided for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37.
61m 2016: 31m of the total provision was utilised in the year.
222 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Included within the restructuring provision is an amount for committed rental expense on surplus lease space consistent with the expected exposure on individual leases where the property is unoccupied.
This element of the provision will be utilised over the remaining life of the leases or until the leases are assigned, and is measured at present values by discounting anticipated future cash flows.
3.15 Debt securities in issue Accounting policy Debt securities comprise shortand long-term debt issued by the Group including commercial paper, medium-term notes, term loans, covered bonds and residential mortgage backed securities RMBS.
Debt securities are initially recognised at fair value, being the issue proceeds, net of transaction costs incurred.
These instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method resulting in premiums, discounts and associated issue costs being recognised in the income statement over the life of the instrument.

Defined contribution pension scheme The Group recognises the obligation for contributions to the scheme as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payment is available.
Defined benefit pension scheme A liability or asset in respect of the defined benefit scheme is recognised on the balance sheet and is measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the defined benefit scheme assets at the reporting date.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation for the scheme is discounted by high quality corporate bond rates that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups defined benefit obligation.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and does not anticipate any future acts by other parties that could change the amount of the surplus that may be ultimately recovered.
Pension expense attributable to the Groups defined benefit scheme comprises current service cost, net interest on the net defined benefit obligation asset, past service cost resulting from a scheme amendment or curtailment, gains or losses on settlement and administrative costs incurred.
Where actuarial remeasurements arise, the Group recognises such amounts directly in equity through the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Actuarial remeasurements arise from experience adjustments the effects of differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and changes in actuarial assumptions.
224 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.
The Groups principal trading subsidiary, Clydesdale Bank PLC, is the sponsoring employer in one funded defined benefit pension scheme, the Yorkshire and Clydesdale Bank Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme was established under trust on 30 September 2009 as a result of the merger of the Clydesdale Bank Pension Scheme and the Yorkshire Bank Pension Fund.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a trustee administered fund, with the Trustee responsible for the operation and governance of the Scheme, including making decisions regarding the Schemes funding and investment strategy.
The Scheme is subject to the funding legislation outlined in the Pensions Act 2004 which came into force on 30 December 2005.
This, together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, sets out the framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension plans in the UK.
The Group also provides post-retirement health care under a defined benefit scheme for pensioners and their dependant relatives for which provision has been made on a basis consistent with the methodology applied to the defined benefit pension scheme.
This is a closed scheme and the provision will be utilised over the life of the remaining scheme members.
The following table provides a summary of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the Scheme: 2017 2016 m m 1 Active members defined benefit obligation 807 1,264 Deferred members defined benefit obligation 1,549 1,776 Pensioner and dependant members defined benefit obligation 1,618 1,497 Total defined benefit obligation 3,974 4,537 Fair value of Scheme assets 4,181 4,462 Net defined benefit pension asset liability 207 75 Post-retirement medical benefits obligations 3 4 1 Active members include current employees who became deferred members on 1 August 2017 as part of the Scheme closure exercise.
The Group has implemented a number of reforms to the Scheme to manage the liability.
It closed the Scheme to new members in 2004 and since April 2006 has determined benefits accruing on a career average revalued earnings basis.
On 1 August 2017, the Scheme was closed to future benefit accrual for the majority of current employees, with affected employees future pension benefits being provided through the existing defined contribution scheme, Total Pension.
The Total Pension income statement charge for the year is shown in note 2.4.
The closure of the Scheme for the majority of current employees has resulted in a reduction in the defined benefit obligation, recognised as a past service credit in the year.
During the year, Clydesdale Bank PLC reached agreement with the Trustee on the Scheme funding valuation at 30 September 2016, with a calculated deficit of 290m.
In the recovery plan dated 31 July 2017 the Group agreed to contribute 50m per annum until 31 March 2022 and 55m in the year to 31 March 2023 to eliminate this deficit.

Derivative holdings may lead to increased or decreased exposures to the physical asset categories disclosed above.
The Scheme is not invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments.
Through its defined benefit pension plan and post-employment medical plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks.
The main risk to the Group is that additional contributions are required if the Schemes assets are not sufficient to pay for the benefits which will be influenced mainly by inflation and the longevity of members.
The level of asset returns will be a key factor in the overall investment return.
The investment portfolio is subject also to a range of risks typical of the assets held, in particular equity risk, credit risk on bonds and exposure to the property market.
226 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information The Trustee has implemented an investment structure including physical assets and derivatives that seeks to reduce the Schemes exposure to inflation and interest rate risks.
The current hedge ratio is around 60% of liabilities when measured on a self-sufficiency basis.
This strategy reflects the Schemes liability profile and the Trustees and the Groups attitude to risk.
The Trustee monitors the investment objectives and asset allocation policy on a regular basis.

The key areas of estimation uncertainty are: The discount rate applied.
The discount rate is required to be set with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds in the currency and with a term consistent with the Schemes obligations.
The average duration of the Schemes obligations is approximately 20 years.
The market for bonds with a similar duration is illiquid and, as a result, significant management judgement is required to determine an appropriate yield curve on which to base the discount rate.
Inflation is set with reference to market expectations of the RPI measure of inflation for a term consistent with the Schemes obligations, based on data published by the BoE.
Other measures of inflation such as CPI, or inflation measures subject to an annual cap are derived from this assumption.
The cost of the benefits payable by the Scheme will also depend upon the life expectancy of the members.
The assumptions for mortality rates are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future improvements in life expectancies.
The table below sets out the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation and pension cost to realistic changes in the key actuarial assumptions: Assumption change Impact on Impact on defined pension benefit obligation cost m m Discount rate 0.25% 186 6 -0.25% 199 6 Inflation 0.25% 140 4 -0.25% 135 4 Life expectancy 1 year 136 4 -1 year 139 4 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The discounted mean term of the defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2017 is 20 years 2016: 22 years.
The expected contributions for the year ending 30 September 2018 are 33m 2017: Nil and expected benefit payments for the year ending 30 September 2018 are 100m 2017: 85m.
During the current year, the Group and Trustee entered into a contingent security arrangement the Security Arrangement note 5.3.

When available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument.
Where no such active market exists for the particular asset or liability, the Group uses a valuation technique to arrive at the fair value, including the use of transaction prices obtained in recent arms length transactions where possible, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
In doing so, fair value is estimated using a valuation technique that makes maximum possible use of market inputs and that places minimal possible reliance upon entity-specific inputs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, which represents the fair value of the consideration given or received, unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument i. e. without modification or repackaging or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
When such evidence exists, the Group recognises profits or losses on the transaction date.
In certain limited circumstances the Group applies the fair value measurement option to financial assets including loans and advances where the inherent market risks principally interest rate and option risk are individually hedged using appropriate interest rate derivatives.
The loan is designated as being carried at fair value through profit or loss to offset the movements in the fair value of the derivative within the income statement and therefore avoid accounting mismatch.
When a loan is held at fair value, a statistical based calculation is used to estimate expected losses attributable to adverse movements in credit risk on the assets held.
This adjustment to the credit quality of the asset is then applied to the carrying amount of the loan to arrive at fair value and recognised in the income statement.
Analysis of the fair value disclosures uses a hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in measuring fair value.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement is categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for an identical financial asset or liability: Level 2 fair value measurements inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements inputs for the financial asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
For the purpose of reporting movements between levels of the fair value hierarchy, transfers are recognised at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur.
a Fair value of financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet at amortised cost The tables overleaf show a comparison of the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost, as reported on the balance sheet, and their fair values where these are not approximately equal.
There are various limitations inherent in this fair value disclosure particularly where prices are derived from unobservable inputs due to some financial instruments not being traded in an active market.
The methodologies and assumptions used in the fair value estimates are therefore described in the notes to the tables.
The difference between carrying value and fair value is relevant in a trading environment, but is not relevant to assets such as loans and advances.

Contractual cash flows are then adjusted for expected credit losses and expectations of customer behaviour based on observed historic data.
The cash flows are then discounted using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and maturity to arrive at an estimate of their fair value.
Certain variable rate loan portfolios are discounted using market rates on similar loans offered by the Group at the valuation date.
b Due to customers The fair value of deposits is determined from a discounted cash flow model using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and maturity.
c Debt securities in issue The fair value is taken directly from quoted market prices where available or determined from a discounted cash flow model using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and maturity.
b Fair value of financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet at fair value The following tables provide an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, using the fair value hierarchy described above.

The Groups fair values for financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are based on the following methodologies and assumptions: a Derivative financial assets and liabilities The fair values of derivatives, including foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate and currency option contracts, and currency swaps, are obtained from discounted cash flow models or option pricing models as appropriate.
230 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information b Available for sale investments Listed Level 1 The fair values of listed investments are based on quoted closing market prices.
Unlisted Level 3 Includes 2m of Visa Inc. preferred stock received as partial consideration for the sale of the Groups share in Visa Europe note 2.3.
The preferred stock is convertible into Visa Inc. common stock or its equivalent at a future date, subject to potential reduction for certain litigation losses that may be incurred by Visa Europe.
The fair value of the preference shares has been calculated by taking the period end New York Stock Exchange share price for Visa Inc. and discounting for illiquidity and clawback related to contingent litigation.
For other unlisted equity and debt investments, the Groups share of the net asset value or the transaction price respectively are considered the best representation of the exit price and are the Groups best estimates of fair value.
Available for sale other Level 3 The other available for sale financial asset represents deferred consideration receivable and consists of the rights to future commission.
The valuation is determined from a discounted cash flow model incorporating estimated attrition rates and investment growth rates appropriate to the underlying funds under management.

CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 231 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs in Level 3 valuations The table below lists key unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments, and provides the range of those inputs as at 30 September 2017.
Fair value Valuation Unobservable Low High m technique inputs range range Financial assets Portfolio lifetime Other financial assets at fair value 477 Discounted cash flow probability of default 2.2% 11.3% Funds under management Available for sale other 6 Discounted cash flow attrition rate 10% 20% Available for sale investments unlisted 4 Discounted cash flow Contingent litigation risk 0% 100% The Group has 26m 2016: 48m of financial liabilities at fair value classed as Level 3 which represent a portfolio of term deposits that are directly linked to the customer loans, which are also held at fair value and classed as Level 3.
Their relationship to the fair value assets is such that should the liability be settled, the amount payable would be net of the fair value asset.
Sensitivity of Level 3 fair value measurements to reasonably possible alternative assumptions Where valuation techniques use non-observable inputs that are significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety, changing these inputs will change the resultant fair value measurement.
The most significant exposure to Level 3 fair value measurements is in respect of the Groups fair value loan portfolio with the most significant input other than interest rates being the future expectations of credit losses.
If lifetime expected losses were 20% greater than predicted, the carrying value of the loans would decrease by 2m and vice versa.
The most significant input impacting the fair value of the available for sale other asset is the funds under management attrition rate.
The Group currently assumes a 15% attrition rate.
If this rate was 20% the fair value would reduce by 1m, if it was 10% the fair value would increase by 2m.
The most significant input impacting the fair value of the available for sale investments is contingent litigation risk.
If this risk crystallised, the fair value would reduce by 2m.
In the event the litigation risk did not transpire the fair value would increase by 3m.
Other than these significant Level 3 measurements, the Group has a limited remaining exposure to Level 3 fair value measurements, and changing one or more of the inputs for fair value measurements in Level 3 to reasonable alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly with respect to profit or loss, total assets, total liabilities or equity on these remaining Level 3 measurements.
232 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Section 4: Capital 4.1 Equity Accounting policy Equity The financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity i. e. forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Dividends Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Final dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity when they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are deducted from equity when they are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Proposed final dividends for the year are disclosed as an event after the balance sheet date.

The share for share exchange in the year to 30 September 2016 arose on the Groups demerger from NAB and listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the shareholders of the Company.
All shares in issue at 30 September 2017 rank equally with regard to the Companys residual assets.
The Directors have recommended a final dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September 2017 of 1p per ordinary share in the Company 2016: Nil to be paid on 16 February 2018.
The payment of the final dividend is subject to approval of the shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
These financial statements do not reflect the recommended dividend.

CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 233 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 4: Capital continued 4.1.
3 Capital reorganisation reserve The capital reorganisation reserve of 839m was recognised on the issuance of CYBG PLC ordinary shares in February 2016 in exchange for the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Groups previous parent company, CYBI Limited.
The reserve reflects the difference between the consideration for the issuance of CYBG PLC shares and CYBI Limiteds share capital and share premium.
4 Merger reserve A merger reserve of 633m was recognised on the issuance of CYBG PLC ordinary shares in February 2016 in exchange for the acquisition of the entire share capital of CYBI Limited.
The merger reserve reflects the difference between the consideration for the issuance of CYBG PLC shares and the nominal value of the shares issued.
5.1 Asset revaluation reserve The asset revaluation reserve includes the gross revaluation increments and decrements arising from the revaluation of land and buildings.
5.2 Available for sale reserve The available for sale reserve records the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets.
The principal movement in the reserve reflects the sale of VocaLink during the year as detailed in note 2.3.
5.3 Cash flow hedge reserve The cash flow hedge reserve represents the cumulative post-tax gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the income statement when the hedged items affect profit or loss.
As at 30 September 2017, the cash flow hedge reserve reflected a cumulative loss of 1m 2016: 66m cumulative gain.
The fair value of derivatives in cash flow hedges decreased by 84m in the year 2016: 105m increase, and a 4m gain 2016: 2m gain was recycled to interest income in line with hedged items affecting profit or loss.
A 0.3m loss 2016: 1m loss was transferred to non-interest income due to ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges.
These movements were offset by a deferred tax credit of 21m 2016: charge of 25m.
5.4 Equity-based compensation reserve The Groups equity based compensation reserve records the value of equity settled share based payment benefits provided to the Groups employees as part of their remuneration that has been charged through the income statement and adjusted for deferred tax.
4.2 Equity based compensation Accounting policy The Group operates a number of equity settled share based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees.
The fair value of the services received is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is measured by reference to the fair value of the Companys shares, performance options or performance rights granted, including, where relevant, any market performance conditions and any non-vesting conditions.
The impacts of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions are not included in the fair value and instead are included in estimating the number of awards or options that are expected to vest.
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
A corresponding credit is recognised in the equity based compensation reserve, adjusted for deferred tax.
In some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the start of the service period and the grant date.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares, performance options and performance rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market and service vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity based compensation reserve.
The equity settled share based payment charge for the year is 6m 2016: 5m.
In the prior year, the figures include awards under the Groups and NAB share plans.
The charges under the NAB share plans were classified as equity settled share based payments up to the demerger date of 8 February 2016 and are included in the total above.
Following the demerger these plans no longer meet the definition of share based payments under IFRS 2 Share based payments: accordingly, the total above excludes NAB share plan costs after 8 February 2016.
Details of these plans are included within the Directors remuneration report.

Determination of grant date fair values Participants of the DEP and LTIP plans are not entitled to dividends until the awards vest, but the number of shares which vest may be increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid up to the end of the holding period for the awards, subject to the extent permitted under the relevant remuneration regulation.
Accordingly, the grant date fair value of the awards with only service conditions and or non-market performance conditions has been taken as the market value of the Companys ordinary shares at the grant date.
Where awards are subject to non-market performance conditions, an estimate is made of the number of awards expected to vest in order to determine the overall share-based payment charge to be recognised over the vesting period.
The Group has not issued awards under any CYBG plan with market performance conditions.
236 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information Section 5: Other notes 5.1 Contingent liabilities and commitments Accounting policy Financial guarantees The Group provides guarantees in the normal course of business on behalf of its customers.
Guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the Group to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and are primarily issued to support direct financial obligations such as commercial bills or other debt instruments issued by a counterparty.
The rating of the Group as a guarantee provider enhances the marketability of the paper issued by the counterparty in these circumstances.
Financial guarantee contracts are initially recorded at fair value which is equal to the premium received, unless there is evidence to the contrary.
Operating lease commitments The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases: with operating lease rentals charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group discloses its obligations for future minimum payments under non-cancellable leases.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless they are remote.
The table below sets out the amounts of financial guarantees and commitments which are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Financial guarantees and commitments are credit-related instruments which include acceptances, letters of credit, guarantees and commitments to extend credit.
The amounts do not represent the amounts at risk at the balance sheet date but the amounts that would be at risk should the contracts be fully drawn upon and the customer default.
Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contract amounts is not representative of future liquidity requirements.
Financial guarantees 2017 2016 m m Guarantees and assets pledged as collateral security: Due in less than 3 months 19 19 Due between 3 months and 1 year 40 44 Due between 1 year and 3 years 7 9 Due between 3 years and 5 years 3 3 Due after 5 years 42 48 No specified maturity 111 123 Other credit commitments Undrawn formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend at call 8,408 7,690 Capital commitments The Group had future capital expenditure which had been contracted for but not provided for at 30 September 2017 of 1m 2016: 2m.

Following the failure of a number of financial institutions, claims were triggered against the FSCS, initially to pay interest on borrowings which the FSCS has raised from the UK Government to support the protected deposits.
During 2015, the FSCS levy was also invoiced to institutions for the third of three annual levies to cover capital repayments to the UK Government.
The principal of these borrowings, which remains after the three annual levies have been paid, is anticipated to be repaid from the realisation of the assets of the defaulted institutions.
The FSCS has however confirmed that the size of the future levies will be kept under review in light of developments from the insolvent estates.
The FSCS has estimated levies due to 31 March 2018 for the interest on borrowings and an accrual of 2m 30 September 2016: 8m is held for the Groups calculated liability to that date.
The ultimate FSCS levy as a result of the failures is uncertain.
Conduct risk related matters There continues to be significant uncertainty and thus judgement is required in determining the quantum of conduct risk related liabilities, with note 3.14 reflecting the Groups current position in relation to redress provisions including those for PPI.
The final amount required to settle the Groups potential liabilities for these, and other conduct related matters, is materially uncertain.
Contingent liabilities include those matters where redress is likely to be paid and costs incurred but the amounts cannot currently be estimated.
The financial exposure to the Group related to legacy conduct risks is mitigated by the Capped Indemnity provided by NAB note 3.14.
The Group will continue to reassess the adequacy of provisions for these matters and the assumptions underlying the calculations at each reporting date based upon experience and other relevant factors at that time.
Legal claims The Group is named in and is defending a number of legal claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
No material adverse impact on the financial position of the Group is expected to arise from the ultimate resolution of these legal actions.
