John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 121 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 1 GENERAL INFORMATION John Laing Group plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Companys ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
The remuneration of the Directors of the Company is shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 73.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, except for investments at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL which are stated at fair value.
For the reasons set out on page 89, the Companys financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the Directors, which have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding years, is shown below.
b Investments The Company meets the denition of an Investment Entity under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and as such has adopted Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
See note 2a to the Group financial statements for details on how the Company has concluded that it meets the denition of an investment entity.
In accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and the Investment Entities standard, the Company has accounted for its investments as follows: Investments at fair value through profit or loss The Company has accounted for its investment in John Laing Holdco Limited at FVTPL, consistent with the Group financial statements.
Investments at cost Under IAS 27, the Company has elected to account for its interest in directly owned subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage in permitted investment related activities Service Companies at cost less provision for impairment.
In the Group financial statements, these interests are consolidated.
c Taxation Current tax The tax charge or credit represents the sum of tax currently payable or receivable.
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

As set out in note 2a of the Group financial statements, the Company holds its investments in non-recourse project companies through intermediate holding company subsidiaries with its investment in its directly-held intermediate holding company subsidiary John Laing Holdco Limited recorded at FVTPL in the Group and Company accounts.
The Company also has investments in directly-owned subsidiaries that provide investment-related services or engage in permitted investment-related activities with investees.
These subsidiaries, referred to as service companies, are consolidated in the Group accounts rather than recorded at FVTPL.
In the Company accounts, these investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.
Inter-company transactions occur between subsidiaries in which investments are recorded at FVTPL and subsidiaries that are consolidated in the Group accounts.
The differences in the amounts of i investments at FVTPL and ii fair value movements in the year between the Company Financial Statements as stated above and the Group financial statements occur because in the latter inter-company balances arising from the transactions referred to above are eliminated under the normal basis of consolidation, whereas in the Company accounts these inter-company balances are not eliminated.
The differences do not relate to any items that might have an effect on the tax recognised in the Group accounts.
