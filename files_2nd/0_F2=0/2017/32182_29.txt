3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Our CSR Policy sets out how we manage the impact of our business on society and the local environment, to control our risks and manage our opportunities in a sustainable manner.
We participated in the FTSE4Good Annual Index Series survey and achieved a low environmental impact.
We also use the detail in this CSR Report to participate in other benchmarks, such as the annual Carbon Disclosure Project CDP and Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark GRESB to engage with our other Ethical Investors.
Notwithstanding this and in order to maintain an efficient and sustainable business for our stakeholders, we have continued to commit significant resources to the environmental and social aspects of our storage operations, property portfolio, new store developments and site acquisitions.
In this report we state our energy use and carbon emissions in compliance with the Companies Act and the Climate Change Regulation on Reporting Greenhouse Gas GHG Emissions for listed companies.
For more details on our applications for the above benchmarks please go to the Basis of Reporting section of the CSR section of our Investor Relations website.
In this report we have provided a summary of our Scope 1 onsite gas use, solar electricity generation and refrigerant use, and Scope 2 off site supplied electricity for our carbon dioxide equivalent CO e emissions.
We have used the DEFRA Department Environmental Reporting 2 Guidelines 2013 Version 1.0 Standard Set 2016: expiring 30 June 2017 conversion factors for our annual GHG Emission calculations and reporting.
Also we are reporting using the UK Government GHG conversion factors for company reporting expiring 30 June 2017.
Finally, we also report on our environmental key performance indicators and identify them using the codes from the Global Reporting Initiative GRI, as applied by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA at the request of some of our stakeholders.
Annual same store portfolio electricity use and carbon emission comparisons are shown.
Our materiality threshold for energy use is 5% and for carbon emissions is 1%.
A limited level of assurance for our Scope 1 and 2 energy use and GHG emissions is independently applied.
This assurance is undertaken by Deloitte LLP in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 Revised.
Long Term Electricity Use 2008 to 2017 Between 2008 and 2010 we installed motion sensor lighting in many of our stores and renewable energy initiatives were included in our new store openings, such as solar panels on 10 stores : wind turbines on two stores : and ground source heat pumps in five stores and these achieved both electricity use reduction and sustainable electricity generation across our store portfolio.
From 2010 to 2013 there was an increase in our total electricity use as a result of our new store openings and increases in our customer occupancy.
Customers increase electricity use by more regular activation of our motion sensor lighting and the increased use of electrical socket supply in our stores.
2011 was our peak year benchmarking year for electricity use.
From 2013, our investment in energy efficiency programmes such as internal and external LED re-lamping across the store portfolio and the installation of larger capacity 50kWp solar panels at seven of our stores reduced our electricity use and increased our own electricity generation to 2016.
45 Strategic Report continued Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY continued In the last 12 months our customer occupancy has continued to grow and some stores have required further internal partitioning works the fit out of second phases of storage space which has increased our electricity use.
In addition store acquisitions at Nine Elms and Twickenham 2 have further added to our total electricity use.
Electricity use has therefore increased our linear trend and total use in 2017 was 9,568,862 kWh year.
The acquired stores will be re-lamped with energy efficient LED lamps in the future years.
See page 58 for their independent assurance report.
Note: 2011 was our peak electricity use 13,925,217 kWh.
From 2017, we no longer including Bagshot and Maidenhead in the Group energy totals, and the consumption at these stores is now reported in a separate table.
This approach is explained in the Basis of Reporting.
New Store Acquisitions and Same Store Portfolio Electricity Use 2016 v 2017 Two newly acquired stores in 2017 increased our total electricity use by 99,673 kWh.
On an annual same store basis, the 2017 total electricity use would have been 9,469,189 kWh, without the acquisitions, 32.0% below our peak.
See page 58 for independent assurance report.
Note: 2011 is our peak electricity use 13,925,217 kWh.
2011 Grid electricity cost excluding VAT but including CCL at 0.0043 kWh was 59,878.
Our UK network electricity supply provides 94% of our total energy use.
We continue to seek reductions in our kWh use, costs and taxes through investment in our energy efficient technology and from our solar electricity self supply.
Our electricity use has reduced 31.3% since our peak use year in 2011, notwithstanding which the Climate Change Levy has increased by 30%.
The CCL for 2017 53,490 has been reduced by 20.1% from its peak in 2013, due to our investment in our energy efficient internal and external LED re-lamping programmes.
In 2017 there has been an increase of 3% in the CCL due to an increase in the CCL rate and more electricity use, as a result of growing customer numbers and the acquisition of the two additional stores.
46 Store Portfolio Long Term Solar Electricity Generation 2009 to 2017 MWh Our portfolio of stores with roof-mounted solar PV installations generate low carbon electricity that is monitored for performance and receives financial payments from the energy companies that we export to.
There are 17 stores with PV installations and the Feed-in Tariff payments for generation and Deemed Export of electricity apply to all these installations.
Solar generation performance in the first quarter of 2017 reduced due to our PV systems at Fulham and Merton requiring inverter replacement and maintenance, respectively.
In June 2016, solar generation also under-performed due to unseasonal cloud cover.
In the second and third quarters of 2017 our Sheen and Bromley solar installations lost generation data communication: these were repaired during annual maintenance visits and payments then continued to be received.
Solar Payments from Energy Companies are Feed in Tariff plus Deemed Export kWh payments amounting to 82,812: Supplied UK Network displaced electricity savings: 342,670 solar kWh x 9p Grid kWh displaced amounting to 30,840.
Note: 2011 is our first significant 107,074 kWh y solar electricity Self Supply generation.
In total our solar portfolio generated 342,670 kWh in 2017, a reduction of 4.4% compared to the previous year.
This was mainly due to maintenance issues and less sunshine hours in June 2016.
Solar electricity generation represents a saving of approximately 9 pence per kWh for displaced UK network supplied electricity, a saving of 30,840 over the year.
The total payments from EDF and Good Energy for solar generation Feed in Tariff and Deemed Export payments was 82,812, providing us with a total saving of 113,652 for 2017.
Solar electricity contributed 3.6% of our total supplied store electricity use or 14.2% of the electricity use in the 17 stores with solar PV systems.
Our larger capacity 50 kWh installations such as the system at Gypsy Corner generate approximately 40,000 kWh year.
This can equate to nearly 30% of the stores annual kWh demand.
During the first three years of a stores trading from new build we can export more electricity up to 60% of the electricity generated back to the Grid.
In later years, when customer occupancy rises to store maturity 85% occupancy more solar electricity is used by the store and export to the national network diminishes.

47 Strategic Report continued Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY continued Gas use for the heating of our flexi offices at eight stores reached a peak benchmark in December 2012, due to the coldest winter since our records began.
The increase in gas use in 2017 was 6.5% and is predominantly due to higher flexi office occupancy compared to the previous two years.
Total Energy Use Electricity and Gas and Materiality Total Electricity and Gas kWh Use and Gas Use Materiality % Year ended 31 March 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Total Energy Use kWh 13,870,468 12,340,810 10,245,904 9,968,342 10,199,325 Total Reductions from 2011 Peak % 4.9% 15.4% 29.7% 31.6% 30.1% Gas Materiality % 5.2% 5.3% 5.8% 5.9% 6.2% Note: 2011 was our peak energy use year 14,581,234 kWh In 2017, our combined UK network supplied energy electricity and gas reduced by 30.0% from our peak energy use in 2011, mainly due to electricity efficiency reductions after our LED re-lamping programmes and reduced gas use due to new boiler efficiency and less demand in the warmer winters since 2012.
In 2017 there was a 2.3% increase in energy use due to higher levels of customer occupancy in our stores and the acquisition of two new stores.
Our gas use materiality compared to total gas and electricity use increased to 6.2% in 2017, 1.2% above the materiality threshold level of 5% for reporting gas data.
2 Note: 2011 is our Peak Energy Use of 14,581,234 kWh: Annual Average Occupancy was 197,884 m : 2 2 Intensity was 73.7 kWh occupancy m : Intensity was 26.7 kWh m of GIFA.
Since 2011 customer occupancy has increased by 64.5% and energy use intensity per annual average occupancy has reduced by 57.5%.
Our total store portfolio gross internal floor area GIFA increased between 2011 and 2017 by 15.4% through new store openings and store acquisitions.
This has helped us to achieve a 39.3% reduction in kWh use per GIFA from 2011.
Note: 2011 is our Peak Energy Use 14,581,234 kWh: Revenue was 61,885,000: kWh Revenue was 0.24: Group revenue has increased by 76.3% since 2012.
Our energy use intensity kWh per revenue has reduced by 62.5% in the same time period.
Revenue intensity reduction represents all of the self storage activities and services from our 73 store portfolio.
A reduction of 10% in our energy use by revenue intensity was achieved in 2017, maintaining our annual reductions in intensity since 2011.
Our non-store portfolio consists of two business administration centres: our head office at Bagshot, Surrey and our warehouse depot for the storage and distribution of our packing materials at Maidenhead, Berkshire.
They both provide services to the store portfolio.
The head office electricity use is more intense due to higher staff occupancy.
Electricity is mainly used for lighting, heating or cooling and computer equipment in the office areas.
The total electricity reductions for both the head office and Maidenhead from the benchmark year 2011 was 14.2%.
The reductions were mainly due to energy efficient LED re-lamping and more efficient air conditioning and IT equipment investment programmes.
Mandatory Greenhouse Gas GHG Emissions Statement The ISAE 3000 Standard provides an evaluation methodology for both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of our carbon management and our energy use.
We report our self storage portfolio emissions and the absolute emissions that include our non store portfolio.
Our key carbon emission performance indicators use the GRI and the EPRA codes, at the request of our investors and other stakeholders, for real estate investment trust REIT benchmarking purposes.
We report energy use and carbon emissions in compliance with the Companies Act and Climate Change Regulation on Reporting Greenhouse Gas GHG Emissions for listed companies.
For more details on our applications for the above benchmarks see the Basis of Reporting section of the CSR section of our Investor Relations website.
In this Report we have provided a summary of our Scope 1 onsite heating gas use, solar electricity generation and refrigerant use, and Scope 2 off site UK supplied electricity, for GHG equivalent CO e emissions.

This year seven stores had refrigerant top up totalling 32.5 kg.
Refrigerant use has reduced from our peak use in 2014 by 71.1% and tCO e 2 emissions have reduced by 80.9%.
Scope 1 Refrigerant emissions from our store portfolio air conditioners occur when small quantities of Refrigerant require topping up.
The Refrigerant we use R410A is a Kyoto Protocol Blend that maintains an efficient working environment.
Refrigerant use has a direct global warming impact and is required to be recorded for local and national reporting purposes over a 100 year period, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Note: 2014 was the peak year for Total Scope 1 Direct GHG emissions.
The 2017 total Scope 1 Direct GHG emissions from gas and coolant emissions is 183.9 tCO e. This represents a significant 61.3% reduction 2 in GHG emissions from our peak emissions year in 2014 and was partly due to our choice of Refrigerant, which is now an efficient Kyoto Protocol Blend.
Note: 2011 was the peak electricity use 13,925,217 kWh and 6,758 tCO e. 2 Our Scope 2 UK Network Supplied Electricity use has reduced by 31.3% from our peak in 2011 due to our energy efficiency programmes: these have reduced GHG emissions by 41.7% over the same time period.
Our Scope 2 supplied electricity has had a variable fuel mix over the last decade.
In recent years we have estimated that low carbon renewables and nuclear generated supplied electricity have contributed to reducing our GHG emissions by around 1% per year over the last 5 years, based on DEFRA DECC UK Scope 2 electricity conversion factors.
50 GHG Emission Reductions Since 2011 our carbon reduction programme has focused on the most significant Scope 2 Grid supplied electricity use and we have achieved reductions based on investment in efficient lighting and maintaining our renewable electricity generation.
We continue to monitor future improvements in replacement LED lamp efficiency to meet the long-term climate change science-based targets.
Our electricity supply from power stations provided 95% of our total annual energy in the year ended 31 March 2017.
Our annual average carbon emission reductions from 2011 is approximately 7% per annum: more than double the target set for the commercial property sector to meet the UK Governments GHG emission target of a 34% reduction by 2020 or a 3.5% reduction per annum to 2050.
Apart from these savings, our electricity efficiency investment programmes have achieved proportional cost savings on our CCL bills and our annual CRC Taxes.

This reduction is partly due to decreases in Scope 1 refrigerant efficiency.
Reductions in Scope 2 were achieved due to contributions from our solar PV investments.
See page 58 for their independent assurance report 2014 was the peak Scope 1 emissions 474.8 tCO e benchmark.

2 2 GHG Emission per average occupied space have reduced by 63.5% and GHG emissions per revenue have reduced by 63.6%.
GHG emission intensity per GIFA has reduced by 47.6% from our peak.
Our future GHG Emission reduction programme is to continue to invest in energy efficiencies and renewable energy, where viable, on new build and acquired stores.
Long Term Energy Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG Emission Target Review 2008 2020 The Kyoto Protocol Reduction Target 2008 to 2012 From 2008 to 2010 we achieved store electricity use reductions by investment in our motion sensor lighting and low carbon renewable energy selfsupply.
From 2010 to 2013 we had an increase in electricity use as a result of our new store openings and increased customer occupancy.
This increase in our emissions delayed the achievement of our 2008 to 2012 Kyoto Protocol Reduction Target of 12.5% until 2014.
The UK Climate Change Act 2008 The Climate Change Act was made legally binding in the 2009 Budget.
It has an interim target of GHG Emission reduction of 34% by 2020.
The longer-term target is to reduce GHG Emission by 80% by 2050 or by approximately 3.5% per year.
52 Our Target is to Reduce Scope 1 & Scope 2 GHG Emissions by 34% by 2020 Our annual GHG Emission since peak energy use in 2011 has reduced by 35.2% or approximately 5% per year on average.
In order to commit to long-term climate change science-based targets we will commit to investing in improved LED technology as they become more efficient, and renewable solar energy on new build stores.
This year we acquired two stores at Nine Elms and Twickenham 2, and these stores will be part of our internal and external LED re-lamping programmes in the future.
These technologies will achieve levels of decarbonisation required to keep global temperatures on a pathway to 2oC above global pre-industrial levels, by 2100.

In 2017 we also reviewed the longer term UK Real Estate Environmental target of a 3.5% reduction in GHG Emission, which is now aligned to the Governments 2050 goal.
Managing the Non-Physical, Physical and Financial Risks of GHG Emission and Climate Change for our Customers, Investors and Other Stakeholders.
Managing the Non-Physical Risks and Opportunities Over the long term, Big Yellows non-physical risks and opportunities have been governed by EU and UK regulation and best practice within the real estate investment sector.
The significance of GHG emission and climate change have been reviewed since 2008 within Board Reports and CSR Meetings.
Building certifications such as Energy Performance Certificates EPCs, the Building Research Establishment Assessment Methodology BREEAM and the Considerate Constructors Scheme CCS are all used in annual investor benchmarks, such as the FTSE4Good: the Carbon Disclosure Project CDP : the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark GRESB.
Financial Risks and Opportunities of Climate Change The financial risks and opportunities of Climate Change are within the cost of sustainable planning, designing and constructing of our new store developments, which can be more sustainable and resilient in the longer term.
The financial risks involve reviewing the existing and acquired stores against extreme weather events such as seasonal storms and flooding.
Our investors also appreciate disclosures and performance benchmarks of our portfolio set against sustainable development and energy efficiency benchmarks to assess our annual reduction in carbon emissions and taxes.
Internal regulatory briefs on compliance and high standards within real estate benchmarks, makes Big Yellow an efficient and low risk investment.
Physical Risks and Opportunities The physical risks from increased GHG emission is climate change, global warming, and the consequences of higher risk weather systems that can increase temperatures, storm frequency, flooding and or droughts.
Big Yellow has physically invested in energy efficiency in order to reduce electricity use and GHG emission.
Our solar stores have customer facing electronic screens displaying real time solar generation kWh and carbon emissions tCO saved in customer reception areas.
2 Big Yellow has also trialled and invested in green roofs and green walls on several of our stores Barking, Chiswick, Fulham, High Wycombe and Sutton in the urban areas of our towns and cities.
These investments provide shade to our stores in the summer that are susceptible to the urban heat island effect.
Green roofs can store moisture after rainfall that evaporates in the spring and summer seasons and cools the upper floor levels.
Rainwater Harvesting Systems are also installed Barking, Chiswick, Liverpool, Merton, Sheffield and Sutton in order to provide landscape irrigation in the summer months.
Several stores have sustainable urban drainage systems that provide permeable car park surfaces or peripheral soft landscaping that can regulate surface water to ground waters and local rivers.

GSHP: Ground Source Heat Pump, SUDS: Sustainable Urban Drainage System, RWH: Rainwater Harvesting Energy Performance Certification EPC Legislation As owners of property who lease space to members of the public, we are required to display EPCs to our customers from 1 October 2008.
Certification is required at new store openings, store acquisitions and when solar panels are retrofitted onto older stores.
We have provided 30 EPCs to date in our stores, representing 41% of the portfolio.
Of the stores certified 73% have high A or B ratings, mainly due to energy efficient internal LED re-lamping and investment in low carbon electricity self-supply, such as solar and ground source heat pump installations.
Considering that the whole portfolio has internal energy efficient LED lighting, apart from the two most recent acquisitions, we are comfortable that the pre-October 2008 stores will at least achieve the EPC B rating in the future, when the opportunity to rate them arises.
Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology BREEAM BREEAM certification is a local planning requirement for our stores, especially for new developments in high-density urban environments.
The methodology assesses impacts and opportunities for enhancing the design and construction environmental aspects.
The certification includes a review of new store energy, sustainable building materials, water efficiency, waste recycling and ecology.
The review also includes social aspects of the building life including its resource management, health, well-being, modes of transport and pollution reduction.
Our BREEAM ratings are mainly Excellent scoring in the 75 76% range and highest in the areas of land use and ecology: transport: waste: pollution: and energy efficiency.
