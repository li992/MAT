120 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YE AR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Intermediate Capital Group plc is incorporated in England and Wales with Company registration number 02234775.
The registered office is Juxon House, 100 St Pauls Churchyard, London EC4M 8BU.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are detailed in the Directors report.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS At the date of signing of these financial statements, certain new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group.
The Directors are in the process of assessing the impact of the forthcoming standards on the operations of the Group.
International Financial Reporting Standards IAS IFRS Accounting periods commencing on or after IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 10 IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Effective date Associate or Joint Venture deferred indefinitely Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2017 Amendments to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based 1 January 2018 Payment Transactions IFRS 9: Financial Instruments is effective for implementation during the financial year ending 31 March 2019.
A detailed analysis of the Groups financial instruments and how these will be affected by the requirements of IFRS 9 has been undertaken.
At this stage, there is not expected to be a material impact on the financial statements, although the ongoing assessment of IFRS 9 is continuing.
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for implementation during the financial year ending 31 March 2019.
A preliminary assessment of IFRS 15 indicates that this will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the EU and in compliance with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and non derivative financial instruments valued at fair value through profit or loss and available for sale financial assets, valued at fair value through equity.
The functional and presentational currency of the Group and Company is Sterling.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Therefore they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparing the financial statements.
The Directors have made this assessment in light of the 970.8m cash and unutilised debt facilities following a period of high realisations, no significant drawn bank facilities maturing in the next 12 months, and after reviewing the Groups latest forecasts for a period of three years from the reporting date.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 38.
This includes on pages 20 to 26 the Finance and Operating Review detailing the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
In addition, note 5 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 121 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Directors continually monitor the debt profile of the Group and Company, and seek to refinance senior facilities a substantial period before they mature.
The Group and Company have no significant drawn facilities due to mature within the next 12 months.
Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate the results of Intermediate Capital Group plc and entities controlled by the Company for the period to 31 March each year.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control.
The Company controls an investee when it has power over the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of control is based on all relevant facts and circumstances and the Company reassesses its conclusion if there is an indication that there are changes in facts and circumstances.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Each component of other comprehensive income and profit or loss is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non controlling interests.
Adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries for consistency with the accounting policies of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, unrealised income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The acquisition method involves the recognition of all assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value on the date of acquisition.
Subsequent changes in contingent consideration resulting from events after the date of acquisition is recognised through the income statement.
The excess of the fair value at the date of acquisition of the cost of investments in subsidiaries over the fair value of the net assets acquired which is not allocated to individual assets and liabilities is determined to be goodwill.
When the Group acquires additional shares in an entity it already controls, any excess of the fair value of consideration over the non controlling interest acquired is immediately deducted from equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries in the Parent Company statement of financial position are recorded at cost less provision for impairments or at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but no control, over the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity.
As the investments in associates are held for venture capital purposes they are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment in joint ventures A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control over the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting from the date on which the investee becomes a joint venture except when the investment is held for venture capital purposes in which case they are designated as fair value through profit and loss.
Under the equity method, an investment in a joint venture is initially recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost, and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the joint ventures profit or loss.
Employee Benefit Trust The Employee Benefit Trust EBT acts as a special purpose vehicle, with the purpose of purchasing and holding shares of the Company for the hedging of future liabilities arising as a result of the employee share based compensation scheme.
The EBT is consolidated into the Groups financial statements.
Own shares held Shares of the Company acquired by the EBT for the purpose of hedging share based payment transactions, or repurchased directly by the Company, are recognised and held at cost in the reserve for own shares.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own shares.
122 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YE AR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Income recognition Finance income includes interest income and dividend income.
Interest income on financial assets held at amortised cost is measured using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement when the Groups right to receive income is established.
Gains on investments movements comprise gains on disposal of available for sale financial assets and fair value gains and losses on both financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Movements are recognised as incurred.
Fund management fees and commissions are recognised in the income statement when the related service has been performed.
The Group receives carried interest from the third party funds it manages once those funds exceed a performance target.
Carried interest is recognised only when there is a reasonable expectation that performance conditions will be met and the amounts will be paid in cash.
Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest expense on financial liabilities, fair value losses on derivatives and net foreign exchange losses.
Interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost is measured using the effective interest rate method.
The expected life of the liability is based upon the maturity date.
Interest expense on financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss is recognised when the obligation to pay interest is established.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Operating leases Operating lease payments, net of lease incentives, are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Employees benefits Contributions to the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The Group issues compensation to its employees under equity settled share based payment plans.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the awards at grant date.
The fair value includes the effect of non market based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of non market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Taxation Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that are unpaid at the reporting date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, other than a business combination, that affects neither the tax nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right of set off, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 123 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions.
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the reporting date.
Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined.
Non monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rates during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified into the following categories, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, available for sale AFS financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include held for trading derivative financial instruments and debt and equity instruments designated as fair value through profit or loss.
A financial asset is classified as at FVTPL if: it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument: or the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise: or the financial asset is managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Groups documented risk management or investment strategy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value on a recurring basis with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value recognised through gains in investments in the income statement.
Dividends or interest earned on the financial asset are excluded from the gains on investments and recognised separately within finance income.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are held at amortised cost, less any impairment.
They are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They include loans made as part of the Groups operating activities as well as trade and other receivables.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The carrying value of loans and receivables is considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Any premium or discount on disposal of a loan or receivable to a third party is recognised through gains on investments.
Available For Sale AFS financial assets are financial assets not classified elsewhere and include listed bonds and listed and unlisted equity instruments.
AFS financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.
They are subsequently measured at fair value on a recurring basis with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included as a separate component of equity until its sale or impairment, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised through gains in investments in the income statement.
Dividend income earned on the financial asset is excluded from the gains on investments and recognised separately within finance income.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the assets carrying value amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable, and the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, is recognised in profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial assets Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to either settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
124 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YE AR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Impairment of financial assets With the exception of financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that financial assets may be impaired at each reporting date such as a covenant breach or restructuring.
A financial asset is impaired when objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event has an impact on the estimated future flows.
For an investment in an equity instrument held as an AFS financial asset, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below cost is considered objective evidence of impairment.
If an impairment event has occurred on financial assets measured at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
If the impairment relates to AFS financial assets, the loss is recycled from other comprehensive income to the income statement.
With the exception of AFS assets if, in a subsequent period, the amount of impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS financial assets, impairment losses previously recognised in the income statement are not reversed through the income statement.
Any increase in value, subsequent to an impairment loss, is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial assets held for sale The Group classifies non current financial assets that are expected to be recovered primarily from sale as held for sale.
This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale, the Directors are committed to the sale, and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from date of classification.
Non current assets held for sale are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities which include borrowings, with the exception of financial liabilities designated as FVTPL, are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL include derivative liabilities and other financial liabilities designated as FVTPL.
A financial instrument is classified as at FVTPL if it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument, or the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value on a recurring basis with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value recognised through gains in investments in the income statement.
Interest paid on the financial instruments is excluded from the gains on investments and recognised separately within finance costs.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Derivative financial instruments for hedging The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are not considered to be closely related to the host contract, are recognised at fair value determined using independent third party valuations or quoted market prices on a recurring basis.
Changes in fair values of derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whilst a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
A derivative is presented as a non current asset or non current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months, otherwise a derivative will be presented as a current asset or current liability.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 125 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out in the Business Combinations accounting policy and is reviewed at least annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Groups income statements and is not subsequently reversed.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately, including investment management contracts and contact databases, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
These are measured at cost and are being amortised on a straight line basis over the expected life of the contract, currently three to eight years.
Dividends paid Dividends paid to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the period in which the dividends are declared.
In the case of final dividends, this is when they are approved by the Companys shareholders at the AGM.
Dividends paid are recognised as a deduction from equity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of judgement Control and significant influence When assessing whether ICG controls any entities it is necessary to determine whether ICG acts in the capacity of principal or agent for the third party investor.
An agent is a party primarily engaged to act on behalf and for the benefit of another party or parties, whereas a principal is primarily engaged to act for its own benefit.
This is an area of significant judgement and is determined with reference to decision-making authority, rights held by other parties, remuneration and exposure to returns.
A significant judgement when determining that ICG acts in the capacity of principal or agent is the kick-out rights of the third party shareholders.
Across each of the funds where ICG has a significant ownership interest greater than 15% we have reviewed these kick-out rights.
Where the investors have substantive rights to remove ICG as the investment adviser it has been concluded that ICG is an agent to the fund and thus the fund does not require consolidation into the Group.
However, we consider ICG to have significant influence over these funds and have therefore recognised them as associates.
Where the conclusion is that ICG acts in the capacity of principal the fund has been consolidated into the Group.
Further details of this analysis are outlined in notes 31 and 32.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Determination of fair values Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms-length transaction at measurement date.
The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values: 126 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YE AR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 4.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED AFS financial assets and financial assets at FVTPL The fair value of equity investments and warrants are based on quoted prices, where available.
Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is based on recent significant transactions using an earnings based valuation technique or, where the Group holds an investment in an unlisted fund, the net asset value of the fund.
We have reviewed the underlying valuation techniques of these funds and consider them to be in line with those of the Group.
The valuation techniques applied follow the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines December 2015 and include some assumptions which are not supportable by observable market prices or rates.
The majority of the portfolio of unquoted shares and warrants is valued using an earnings based technique.
Earnings multiples are applied to the maintainable earnings of the private company being valued to determine the enterprise value.
From this, the value attributable to the Group is calculated based on its holding in the company after making deductions for higher ranking instruments in the capital structure.
The Groups policy is to use reported earnings based on the latest management accounts available from the company, adjusted for non recurring items.
For each company being valued, the earnings multiple is derived from a set of comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples that have been approved by the Investment Committee.
A premium or discount is applied to the earnings multiple to adjust for points of difference relating to risk and earnings growth prospects between the comparable company set and the private company being valued.
The adjusted multiple is the key valuation input which could change fair values significantly if a reasonably possible alternative assumption was made.
The sensitivity analysis of this input is disclosed in note 5.
Other derivatives The fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
The Group has loans and receivables with a conversion option embedded.
Given the low probability of conversion by the Group, the value attributed to these embedded derivatives is nil.
Impairment On a quarterly basis the Investment Committee reviews each asset in the Groups portfolio.
Assets which are underperforming or which the Committee wishes to receive regular updates on are added to the watch list.
During the quarterly review the Committee will identify any impairment events and subsequently determine the level of impairment required.
Typical impairment events include, but are not limited to, non payment of cash interest, covenant breach, deterioration in trading, a restructuring or a significant and prolonged decline in the value of the investment.
Impairment losses are recognised as the difference between the carrying value of the investment and the discounted value of managements best estimates of future cash flow.
These estimates take into account the level and quality of the investees earnings, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the investee operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Estimating the quantum and timing of these future proceeds involves significant judgement.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date that they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those initially recognised in the financial statements.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
There are systems of controls in place to create an acceptable balance between the potential costs, should such a risk occur, and the cost of managing those risks.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments: market risk liquidity risk credit risk This section provides details of the Groups approach to financial risks and describes the methods used by the Board to mitigate and control such risk.
Market risk Market risk includes exposure to interest rates and foreign currency.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 127 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Interest rate risk The Groups assets include both fixed and floating rate loans and non interest bearing equity investments.
The Groups operations are financed with a combination of its shareholders funds, bank borrowings, private placement notes, public bonds, and fixed and floating rate notes.
The Group manages its exposure to market interest rate movements by matching, to the extent possible, the interest rate profiles of assets and liabilities and by using derivative financial instruments.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
The sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is disclosed below.
The Groups sensitivity to movements is assumed by applying 100 basis points sensitivity to interest rates to the Groups forecast model.
Sensitivity to interest rate risk 2017 2016 Floating Fixed Total Floating Fixed Total m m m m m m Financial assets 4,336.0 1,629.6 5,965.6 2,581.4 1,716.0 4,297.4 Financial liabilities 3,227.0 1,544.7 4,771.7 1,968.1 1,048.8 3,016.9 1,109.0 84.9 1,193.9 613.3 667.2 1,280.5 The sensitivity of floating rate financial assets to the 100 basis points interest rate increase is 43.4m 2016: 25.8m and the sensitivity of financial liabilities to the same interest rate increase is 32.3m 2016: 19.7m.
There is no interest rate risk exposure on fixed rate financial assets or liabilities.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to currency transactions and the translation of net assets, and income statement of foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups most significant exposures are to the Euro and the US Dollar.
Exposure to market currency risk is managed by matching assets with liabilities to the extent possible and through the use of derivative instruments.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently, it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.
The Group is also exposed to currency risk arising on the translation of fund management fee income receipts, which are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar.
Fund management fee income is hedged to provide more certainty over the value of future cash inflows.
The sensitivity to movements in exchange rates is assumed by applying a percentage measure, based on the volatility of the applicable currency, as defined in the Groups treasury policy, to the net currency asset or liability at the balance sheet date.
The effect of fluctuations in other currencies is considered by the Directors to be insignificant in the current and prior year.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining headroom on its financing facilities, particularly its bank facilities.
The table below shows the liquidity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, based on contractual repayment dates of principal and interest payments.
Future interest and principal cash flows have been calculated based on exchange rates and floating rate interest rates as at 31 March 2017.
It is assumed that Group borrowings under its senior debt facilities remain at the same level as at 31 March 2017 until contractual maturity.
Included in financial liabilities maturing in less than one year are contractual interest payments.

Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets, the Group seeks to ensure that the maturity of its debt instruments is matched to the expected maturity of its assets.
During the financial year, $292m and 74m of US private placements were raised with five, eight and 10 year maturities, enabling the repayment of maturing private placements and a reduction in existing bank facilities.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group as a result of a counterparty failing to meet its contractual obligations.
This risk is principally in connection with the Groups loans and receivables due from portfolio companies.
This risk is mitigated by the disciplined credit procedures that the Investment Committees have in place prior to making an investment and the ongoing monitoring of that investment throughout its lifespan.
In addition, the risk of significant credit loss is further mitigated by the Groups policy to diversify its investment portfolio in terms of geography and industry sector and to limit the amount invested in any single company.

The Group minimises its surplus operational cash balance by the regular forecasting of cash flow requirements, debt management and cash pooling arrangements.
Credit risk exposure on cash and derivative instruments is managed in accordance with the Groups treasury policy which provides limits on exposures with any single financial institution.
The Directors consider the Groups credit exposure to trade and other receivables and current assets held for sale to be low and as such no further analysis has been presented.
The Directors consider the credit risk of the investments within the structured entities controlled by the Group to be low.
The investments principally comprise senior loans, and the recourse is limited to within the structured entities that the Group controls.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Directors assessment of the maximum credit risk exposure of the Group and Company at the balance sheet date.
Impairment losses taken during the year reflect the decline in recoverability on individual assets, either as a result of company specific or of general macroeconomic conditions.
The Directors believe that credit risk as a result of the concentration of significant counterparties is low as there is no individual counterparty comprising more than 10% of the Groups total exposure.
The Groups largest individual exposure at 31 March 2017 was 114.5m to Diamond Castle Partners 2014 LP, a portfolio of investments 2016: 110.1m to Parkeon.
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position The information set out below provides information about how the Group determines fair values of various financial assets and financial liabilities.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs 130 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YE AR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 5.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position CONTINUED This is followed by a more detailed analysis of the financial instruments which are based on unobservable inputs Level 3 assets.
The following tables provide reconciliations of movements in their fair value during the year split by asset category and by geography.
The Group is required to provide disclosures at a more detailed level than by asset category, segregating each asset category by sector or geography.
The Group has chosen to present financial instruments by geography as the diverse nature of the Groups assets makes any disclosure of assets by industry less meaningful to the Groups risk profile than geographical factors.

The Groups strategy has remained unchanged from the year ended 31 March 2016.
The capital structure comprises debts, which include the borrowings disclosed in note 24, cash and cash equivalents, and capital and reserves of the Parent Company, comprising called up share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group has complied with the imposed minimum capital throughout the year.
The full Pillar 3 disclosures are available on the Companys website: www.

Segment information about these businesses is presented below and is reviewed by the Executive Committee.
The Group reports the profit of the FMC separately from the profits generated by the IC.
The FMC is defined as the operating unit and as such incurs the majority of the Groups costs, including the cost of the investment network, i. e. the Investment Executives and the local offices, as well as the cost of most support functions, primarily information technology, human resources and marketing.
In the current period external fee income has been shown by strategic asset class and interest income and interest expense have been shown separately whereas previously these were disclosed as net interest income.
The prior periods have been restated to reflect these changes.
The IC is charged a management fee of 1% of the carrying value of the average investment portfolio by the FMC and this is shown below as fee income.
The costs of finance, treasury and portfolio administration teams, and the costs related to being a listed entity, are allocated to the IC.

This is principally due to the impact of differences in overseas tax rates where we invest directly into funds which are based offshore.
The Group is currently reviewing its transfer pricing policies and documentation in the light of the revised Base Erosion Profit Shifting BEPS guidelines issued by the OECD.
While the Group has low tax risk status in the UK, and no open enquiries elsewhere, a provision has been recorded until the review is finalised and the application of the BEPS guidelines by the tax authorities is known.
The adjustments in respect of prior years relate to the carry back of UK tax losses into a prior period.

When assessing whether ICG controls any structured entities funds it is necessary to determine whether ICG acts in the capacity of principal or agent for the third party investor.
This is determined with reference to decision making authority, rights held by other parties, remuneration and exposure to returns.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 159 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below shows details of structured entities that the Group is deemed to control: % of ownership interests and voting rights Name of subsidiary Country of incorporation 2017 US CLO 2014-1 United States of America 100.00% US CLO 2014-2 United States of America 56.00% US CLO 2014-3 United States of America 51.30% US CLO 2015-1 United States of America 50.30% US CLO 2015-2 United States of America 57.50% US CLO 2016-1 United States of America 55.60% US CLO 2017-1 United States of America 59.90% St Pauls CLO II i Ireland 33.90% St Pauls CLO III ii Ireland 49.40% St Pauls CLO VI Ireland 53.20% ICG High Yield Bond Fund Ireland 100.00% ICG Global Total Credit Fund Ireland 100.00% i ii The Capital Requirements Directive requires the originator of any securitisation transaction to hold a minimum 5% of the net economic exposure of the transaction.
ICG holds i 33.9% of St Pauls CLO II and ii 49.4% of St Pauls CLO III and is the largest individual shareholder of both CLOs.
The kick out rights of third party shareholders are protective in nature as they result from a breach of contract, and therefore not indicative of an agent relationship.
ICG is also the collateral manager and as a result management has concluded that ICG is acting as principal.
There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Group to access or use assets and settle liabilities of its subsidiary holdings, with the exception of the structured entities controlled by the Group.
ICG has not provided contractual or non-contractual financial or other support to a consolidated structured entity during the period.
It is not the current intention to provide such support, including the intention to assist the structured entity in obtaining financial support.
ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES ICGs investment strategy is to invest across a range of funds and investments.
In assessing whether ICG controls any individual fund it is necessary to determine whether ICG acts in the capacity of principal or agent for the third party investors.
As such, depending on the fundraising or investment in a companys capital structure, ICG could end up with significant influence and such entities would be considered either associates or joint ventures.
The nature of some of the activities of ICG plcs associates and joint ventures are investment related which are seen as complementing the Groups operations and contributing to achieving the Groups overall strategy.
The remaining associates and joint ventures are portfolio companies not involved in investment activities.
