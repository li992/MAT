5.0 STAKEHOLDERS Big Yellow engages with all of its main stakeholders to provide information and to gain useful feedback from a variety of groups, as described below.
Government Legislation and Standards EU Energy Efficiency Directive: The UK Energy Savings Opportunities Scheme ESOS We appointed an accredited ESOS Assessor, who measured all of our energy consumption and determined significant areas of use.
ESOS was enforced by the Environment Agency and involved the audit of four representative stores from our portfolio.
We assessed future potential energy savings from the report, other than the technologies that we had already programmed and invested in.
We completed the audits in November 2015, before the December 2015 deadline, and have considered changes to our future budget for investing in viable energy saving technologies as a result.
Investor Communications The Carbon Disclosure Project CDP 2016 The CDP is a global initiative by investors designed to encourage companies and their suppliers to publish information on their carbon emissions and climate change strategies, as a measure of their energy use efficiency.
The annual disclosures are in June each year and so we report our 2016 performance in this 2017 CSR Report.
The CDP changed its scoring system in 2016 to combine its Disclosure score within the Performance score as recorded in the table below.
The CDP Performance and Number of Investors Year 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Disclosure Score 65 100 67 100 85 100 93 100 Performance Score B C B C B Number of Investors 534 655 799 884 884 Annual increase in investors 10.7% 10.6% We commit annually to respond to the CDP Investor Programme as a benchmark for the Financials and Real Estate sectors.
We have a combined B rated score for Disclosure and Performance in 2016, for taking coordinated action on climate change issues and implementing current best practice.
Our best performance areas, in descending order, are Management, Leadership, Awareness and Disclosure.
The C Band performance is an average for Financials energy efficiency, reductions and targets.
Big Yellows number of investors increased year on year by approximately 10% in 2014 and 2015, but have remained constant in 2016.
