Corporate information Corporate information for Experian plc the Company is set out in note 1 to the Group financial statements, with further information given in the Strategic report and the Corporate governance report.
Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the Company are presented voluntarily and are: prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK accounting standards: presented in US dollars, the Companys functional currency: and designed to include disclosures in line with those required by those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under UK accounting standards even though the Company is incorporated and registered in Jersey.
Following the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 100 Application of financial reporting requirements coming into effect, the directors opted to prepare the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
The Company intends to continue to use this accounting framework until further notice.
C. FRS 101 exemptions FRS 101 allows certain exemptions from the requirements of IFRS to avoid the duplication of information provided in the Group financial statements and to provide more concise financial reporting in entity financial statements.
The following exemptions have therefore been applied in the preparation of these financial statements: Paragraphs 45 b and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 Share-based payment, so exempting the Company from providing details of share options and of how the fair value of services received was determined.

Areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Company financial statements, are highlighted in note E. 193 Financial statements|Notes to the Company financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2017 D. Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied are summarised below.
They have been consistently applied to both years presented.
The explanations of these policies focus on areas where judgment is applied or which are particularly important in the financial statements.
Content from accounting standards, amendments and interpretations is excluded where there is simply no policy choice under UK accounting standards.
i Foreign currency The Company follows IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
ii Investments shares in Group undertakings Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
The Company follows IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
The fair value of share incentives issued by the Company to employees of Group undertakings is accounted for as a capital contribution and recognised as an increase in the Companys investment in Group undertakings, with a corresponding increase in equity.
iii Debtors and creditors Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at this value.
Where the time value of money is material, they are then carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Creditors are initially recognised at fair value.
iv Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank includes deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments.
v Accounting for derivative financial instruments The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The interest differential reflected in forward foreign exchange contracts is taken to interest receivable and similar income or interest payable and similar expenses.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised at fair value, based on forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
vi Tax Current tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in Ireland, where the Company is resident.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
vii Own shares The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based employee incentive plans.
In connection with these, shares in the Company are held by The Experian plc Employee Share Trust and the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan.
The assets, liabilities and expenses of these separately administered trusts are included in the financial statements as if they were the Companys own.
The trusts assets mainly comprise Experian shares, which are shown as a deduction from total shareholders funds at cost.
Experian shares purchased and held as treasury shares, in connection with the above plans and any share purchase programme, are also shown as a deduction from total shareholders funds at cost.
The par value of shares that are purchased and cancelled, in connection with any share purchase programme, is accounted for as a reduction in called up share capital with any cost in excess of that amount being deducted from the profit and loss account.
The Company is not required to recognise the par value of cancelled shares in a capital redemption reserve.
Contractual obligations to purchase own shares are recognised at the net present value of expected future payments.
Gains and losses in connection with such obligations are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Gains and losses which arise on financial instruments created by advance instruuctions to trade in own shares are recognised directly in equity.
194 Financial statements|Notes to the Company financial statements viii Profit and loss account format Income and expenses, which are recognised on an accruals basis, are reported by nature in the profit and loss account, as this reflects the composition of the Company's income and cost base.
ix Dividend income Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Companys right to receive payment is established.
E. Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments i Critical accounting estimates and assumptions In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of income, costs and charges, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
The resulting accounting estimates, which are based on managements best judgment at the date of the financial statements, will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The most significant of these estimates and assumptions for the Company that has a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is in respect of the carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings.
ii Critical judgments In applying the Companys accounting policies, management may make judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Company financial statements.
These judgments may include the classification of transactions between the Company profit and loss account and the Company balance sheet.
The most significant of these judgments for the Company is in respect of contingencies where, in the case of pending and threatened litigation claims, management has formed a judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate liability.
No liability has been recognised where the likelihood of any loss arising is possible rather than probable.
F. Other operating income and expenses Other operating income and expenses principally comprise charges to and from other Group undertakings in respect of Group management services provided during the year.
Other operating expenses include a fee of US$0.4m 2016: US$0.4m payable to the Company's auditor and its associates for the audit of the Group financial statements.
