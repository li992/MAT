FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS Fixed asset investments comprise investments in subsidiary undertakings, as follows: 2017 2016 m m Cost At 1 January and 31 December 650.2 650.2 Accumulated impairment charges At 1 January and 31 December 207.2 207.2 Net book value At 1 January and 31 December 443.0 443.0 Details of the Companys subsidiaries are shown on pages 191 and 192.
Of the 443.0m 2016: 443.0m investment net book value, 435m 2016: 435m relates to SIG Trading Limited, the largest UK trading subsidiary.
At 31 December 2017, a review of the future operating cashflows of SIG Trading Limited using the following years budget as a base, taking into account current economic conditions, a headroom of 14m exists.
For there to be no headroom, sales would have to reduce by 0.5% or gross margin would have to reduce by 10bps.
The Group considers that a reasonably possible scenario would be a 50bps reduction in gross margin.
If this arose, an impairment of 60m would be required.
A more detailed sensitivity analysis of the Groups significant CGUs is given on page 134, Note 12 of the Financial Statements.
