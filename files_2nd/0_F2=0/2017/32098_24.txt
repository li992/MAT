As a result of this a capital redemption reserve was created following the redemption of the B shares.
In November 2012 a further return of value was made to all shareholders amounting to $128.8m in cash after including a foreign exchange contract gain of $2.4m.
In September 2012, a further $47,079,000 was added to the capital redemption reserve following the redemption of the B shares.
In November 2014, a further $59,380,000 was added to the capital redemption reserve following the redemption of B shares.
2 On 20 November 2014 the TAG acquisition was completed.
As a result of this a merger reserve was created of $1.4bn.
The acquisition of TAG was structured by way of a share for share exchange, this transaction fell within the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 merger relief such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the shares issued.
The Company chose to record its investment in TAG at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable i. e. equal to the difference between the fair value of TAG and the aggregate nominal value of the shares issued.
This merger reserve was initially considered unrealized on the basis it was represented by the investment in TAG, which is not considered to represent qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 17 BL Guidance on the determination of realized profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006.
Immediately following the acquisition of TAG, the Companys investment in TAG was transferred to another Group Company in exchange for an intercompany loan.
To the extent this loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realized.
3 The merger reserve is an unrealized profit until it can be realized by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
$650.0m of the intercompany loan is expected to be settled in qualifying consideration during the year to 30 April 2018 2016: $180.0m and as such an equivalent proportion of the merger reserve is considered realized and therefore has been transferred to the profit and loss account.
As at 30 April 2017 the value of distributable reserves was $660,164,000.
