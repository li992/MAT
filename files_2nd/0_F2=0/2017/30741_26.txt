The main changes from adopting IFRS 15 are detailed below.
Adjusted measures Mobilisation and demobilisation The Directors assess the performance of the Group and its Mobilisation costs are classified as fulfilment costs where they reportable segments based on adjusted measures.
These measures are used for internal performance management and are separately identifiable and specific to a particular project are believed to be most appropriate for explaining underlying and where the mobilisation does not itself form a separate performance obligation.
In these circumstances, mobilisation performance to users of the accounts including Shareholders costs are capitalised as they relate to future performance ofthe Company and other stakeholders.
The adjusted measures in relation to profit exclude exceptional items.
These exceptional obligations, i. e. the provision of power is the future performance items are explained on pages 118 and 126.

Goodwill is monitored by management at an operating segment level.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on the five-year strategic plan approved by management.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to expected changes in revenue utilisation and rates and the cost base, discount rates and long-term growth rates are as follows: 2017 2016 Post-tax Pre-tax Long-term Post-tax Pre-tax Long-term discount discount growth discount discount growth EBITDA rate rate rate EBITDA rate rate rate Power Solutions Industrial 127 8.1% 11.4% 3% 95 8.7% 12.0% 3% Power Solutions Utility 225 8.1% 11.4% 3% 291 8.7% 12.0% 3% Rental Solutions 177 8.1% 11.4% 3% 147 8.7% 12.0% 3% Values in use were determined using current year cash flows, a prudent view of the medium-term business strategy and excludes any growth capital expenditure.
A terminal cash flow was calculated using a long-term growth rate of 3%.
On the basis that the business carried out by all CGUs is closely related and assets can be redeployed around the Group as required, a consistent Group discount rate has been used for all CGUs.
As at 31 December 2017, based on internal valuations, Aggreko plc management concluded that the values in use of the CGUs exceeded their net asset value with the highest headroom value being 1.3 billion and the lowest 456 million.
Given these headroom numbers the Directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions made in their impairment assessment that would give rise to an impairment.

There is no concentration of credit risk in this business and there are a large number of customers who are unrelated and internationally dispersed.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
At an operating unit level a credit rating is normally established for each customer based on ratings from external agencies.
Where no ratings are available, cash in advance payment terms are often established for new customers.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis.
The effectiveness of this credit process has meant that the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt in this business.
Receivables written off during the year as uncollectable as a percentage of total gross debtors was nil% 2016: 1%.
Power Solutions Utility This business concentrates on medium to very large contracts.
Customers are mainly state owned utilities in emerging markets.
In many instances the contracts are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk profile and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bonds and guarantees.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at a Group level.
Contracts are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the customer and country risk.
To date the Group has also had a low level of bad debt in the Power Solutions Utility business.
The total trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2017 for our Power Solutions Utility business was 333 million 2016: 309 million.
Within this balance, receivable balances totalling 41 million 2016: 53 million had some form of payment coverattached to them.
This payment cover guards against the risk of customer default rather than the risk associated with customer disputes.
The risk associated with the remaining 292 million 2016: 256 million is deemed to be either acceptable orpayment cover is not obtainable inacost-effective manner.
Rental Solutions This business is similar to the Power Solutions Industrial business above and the management of trade receivables is similar.

Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured at 24.8% to reflect the enacted tax rates for corporate and state taxes.
This remeasurement givesrise to a 10 million credit in the 2017 Accounts.
A deferred tax liability of nil 2016: 1 million has been recognised in respect ofunremitted earnings.
No other deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings will qualify for the UK dividend exemption and the Group can control the distribution of dividends by its subsidiaries.
In some countries, local tax is payable on the remittance of a dividend.
Were dividends to be remitted from these countries, the additional tax payable would be 13 million.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted byIAS12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related deferred tax benefit through future taxable profits isprobable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 23 million 2016: 11 million of which 21 million 2016: 11 million relates tocarried forward tax losses and 2 million relates to fixed asset timing differences 2016: nil as our forecasts indicate that these assets will not reverse in the near future.
Of the unrecognised deferred tax, 9 million 2016: nil relates to the Younicos entities which were acquired during the year.
Deferred tax assets of 32 million 2016: 33 million have been recognised in respect of entities which have suffered a loss in either thecurrent orpreceding period.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis it is probable there will be future taxable profitsagainst which they can be utilised.
The majority of these assets can be carried forward indefinitely.
