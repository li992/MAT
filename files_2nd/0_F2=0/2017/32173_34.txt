Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 1.
General information and basis of preparation 1.
1 Gener al in f orma tion SSE plc the Company is a company domiciled in Scotland.
The address of the registered office is given on the back cover.
The Groups operations and its principal activities are set out earlier in this Report at pages 2 to 28.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group, these can be seen on pages 187 to 199.
1.2 Basis of preparation Statement of compliance The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 16 May 2017.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and its interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
Going concern The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.
Further details of the Groups liquidity position and going concern review are provided in A6 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 176.
Basis of measurement The financial statements of the Group are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets and assets of the Group pension schemes which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Group pension schemes which are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view.
The financial statements of the Group are presented in pounds sterling.
The basis for including operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling is provided in A1 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 159.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements conforming with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher level of judgement or estimation are summarised at page 114 to 117.
Changes to presentation During the year, the Group reviewed the presentation of information in the financial statements in order to improve the clarity, relevance and understandability of the statements.
This review resulted in a number of changes to presentation which include i the separate presentation of the Company financial statements from the consolidated Group information and the preparation of Company accounts under FRS 101: ii the removal of employee share-based payments and construction contract notes to the financial statements on the basis of materiality, and iii the simplification of certain notes to the accounts by including the Accompanying Information section.
New accounting policies and reporting changes The basis of consolidation and principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below and in the A1 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on pages 159 to 166.
All issued standards, amendments and interpretations of adopted IFRS, mandatory for the year ended 31 March 2017 and not early adopted, have been applied by the Group in the current year and have not had a material impact on the financial statements.
A number of standards have been issued but not yet adopted by the Group because application is not yet mandatory or because adoption by the EU remains outstanding at this point in time: 2.1 IFRS 9 Financial instruments which has been endorsed by the European Union EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018 and thus 1 April 2018 to the Group This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and sets out the requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items.
During the year, the Group has continued to progress its impact assessment from adoption of the standard, focussing on the nature of financial instruments held and the way in which they are used.
The impact assessment is focussed on the three phases of the standard: i Classification and measurement The standard adopts a principles based approach to classify financial assets on the basis of the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics.
The Group anticipates that the current classifications for financial assets will be largely unchanged.
111 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2017 2.
New accounting policies and reporting changes continued 2.1 IFRS 9 Financial instruments which has been endorsed by the European Union EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018 and thus 1 April 2018 to the Group continued ii Impairment The standard includes the requirement that impairment models also consider the expected credit losses on an entitys financial assets held at amortised cost and commitments to extend credit.
The Group anticipates that this will not have a material impact on the Groups results given the low exposure to counterparty default risk as a result of the credit risk management processes that are in place.
iii Hedge accounting The standard does not materially change the amounts recognised in relation to existing hedging arrangements but does simplify the requirements for measuring hedge effectiveness, and thus the eligibility conditions for hedge accounting.
The Group anticipates that there will be minimal impact from adoption on the current Capital and Financial Risk Management structure adopted by the Group.
A detailed and complete impact assessment has not yet been finalised, and will be completed during the course of the next financial year.
The Group has no plans for early adoption.
2.2 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers which has been endorsed by the EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018 and thus 1 April 2018 to the Group This standard replaces IAS 11 Construction contracts, IAS 18 Revenue, IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers and a number of other revenue related interpretations previously adopted by the Group.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to present the transfer of promised goods or services to customers reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The standard has introduced a five-step model as the framework for applying that core principle.
The Group has continued to progress its assessment of the impact adoption of the standard.
This assessment has been focussed on reviewing the contractual terms of the Groups various revenue streams under the five-step model, and highlighting anticipated differences in the recognition and disclosure of revenue.
Whilst any accounting policy changes resulting from adoption of this standard have yet to be confirmed, the indicative Group impact can be summarised as follows: The majority of revenue from energy generation and related trading is managed through the Groups Energy Portfolio Management EPM business utilising energy commodity contracts which are either designated as executory own use contracts or are deemed to constitute financial instruments under IAS 39 and which are therefore outside the scope of IFRS 15.
The presentation of revenue outside the scope of IFRS 15 will be considered as a consequence of IFRS 15 adoption.
This is not expected to have a significant impact the Groups results.
Recognition of revenue from the supply of energy is based on the enforceable right to bill customers based on their consumption of energy and is not expected to change under IFRS 15.
However, the agent principal distinction within IFRS 15 may determine that only the net consideration on certain revenue items such as agent commission or energy delivery service costs may be recognised rather than the gross consideration as currently presented.
This is not expected to impact the Groups results.
The majority of revenue from use of electricity networks is based on tariffs derived from allowed revenue calculations as regulated by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets Ofgem.
No change to recognition or measurement of revenue is expected under IFRS 15.
Construction and service contract revenue is currently based by reference to the stage of completion of overall contract activity or performance of the relevant service, however IFRS 15 requires the separation of a contract into separate performance obligations and recognition of revenue when the customer obtains control either over time or at a certain point in time.
Therefore, depending on managements assessment of the separation or combination of performance standards under IFRS 15, there could be changes in timing and measurement of revenue and cost recognition.
Furthermore, IFRS 15 allows the capitalisation of costs directly related to obtaining, and expected to be recovered through, a customer contract which is currently expensed as incurred.
Whilst our review is currently in progress, we do not expect that these changes will have any significant impact on the Groups results.
The Group will look to confirm accounting policy decisions, and implement necessary processes to capture any adjustments and additional disclosures required, during the course of the next financial year.
The Group anticipates that it will be applying the modified retrospective approach in adopting the standard, and has no plans for early adoption.
2.3 IFRS 16 Leases is effective from 1 January 2019 and thus 1 April 2019 to the Group, and is subject to EU endorsement This standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.
The principal change from the previous standard is the introduction of a single lessee accounting model which requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
The Group has commenced its initial assessment of the impact from this standard and, whilst this assessment is in the early stages, the indicative Group impact from adopting the standard can be summarised in two areas: i Identification of a lease The standard introduces a distinction between a lease and a service contract on the basis of whether a customer is able to control an identifiable asset.
The Group anticipates some existing operating and finance leases may fail to meet this definition, and therefore would be treated as service contracts.
However, the Groups initial view is that this is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups results.
New accounting policies and reporting changes continued 2.3 IFRS 16 Leases is effective from 1 January 2019 and thus 1 April 2019 to the Group, and is subject to EU endorsement continued ii Recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for existing operating leases The standard removes the previous distinction between operating leases and finance leases and requires that, where a lease is identified in a contract, a right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised.
The Group anticipates that adoption is likely to result in the majority of arrangements currently accounted for as operating leases being recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
The majority of the Groups detailed impact assessment work will be performed during the forthcoming financial year and therefore it has not been practicable at this stage to quantify the full implementation effect of the standard.
2.4 Other interpretations and amendments In addition to these issued standards, there are a number of other interpretations, amendments and annual improvement project recommendations that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Group because application is not yet mandatory or because adoption by the EU remains outstanding at this point in time.
These are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financialstatements.
Adjusted accounting measures The Group applies the use of Adjusted accounting measures throughout the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
These measures enable the Directors to present the underlying performance of the Group and its segments to the users of the statements in a consistent and meaningful manner.
The adjustments applied and certain terms such as Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted net debt and hybrid equity are not defined under IFRS and are explained in more detail below.
3.1 Adjusted measures The Directors assess the performance of the Group and its reportable segments based on Adjusted measures.
These measures are used for internal performance management and are believed to be appropriate for explaining underlying performance to users of the accounts.
These measures are also deemed the most useful for the ordinary shareholders of the Company and for other stakeholders.
The performance of the reportable segments is reported based on Adjusted profit before interest and tax Adjusted operating profit.
This is reconciled to Reported profit before interest and tax by adding back exceptional items and certain re-measurements see Note 3.2 below and after the removal of interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
The performance of the Group is reported based on Adjusted profit before tax which excludes exceptional items and certain re-measurements see below, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
The interest costs removed are non-cash and are subject to variation based on actuarial valuations of schemeliabilities.
The Groups key performance measure is Adjusted earnings per share EPS, which is based on basic earnings per share before exceptional items and certain re-measurements see below, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and after the removal of deferred taxation.
Adjusted profit after tax is presented on a basis consistent with Adjusted EPS except for the exclusion of payments to holders of hybrid equity.
The financial statements also include an Adjusted net debt and hybrid equity measure.
This presents financing information on the basis used for internal liquidity risk management.
This measure excludes obligations due under finance leases and includes cash held as collateral on commodity trading exchanges and other short-term loans.
At 31 March 2016, prior to the change in consolidation treatment for the venture, this measure excluded non-recourse debt associated with Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited see Note 4.2 iii.
The measure represents the capital owed to investors, lenders and equity holders other than the ordinary shareholders.
As with Adjusted earnings per share, this measure is considered to be of particular relevance to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as other stakeholders and interested parties.
Finally, the financial statements include an investment and capital expenditure measure.
This metric represents the capital invested by the Group in projects that are anticipated to provide a return on investment over future years and is consistent with internally applied metrics.
This therefore includes capital additions to Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets and also the Groups funding of joint venture and associates capital projects.
The Group has considered it appropriate to report these values both internally and externally in this manner due to its use of equity-accounted investment vehicles to grow the Groups asset base, where the Group is providing the source of funding to the vehicle through either loans or equity.
The Group does not include project-funded ventures in this metric.
In addition, the Group excludes from this metric additions to its Property, Plant and Equipment funded by Customer Contributions and additions to Intangible Assets associated with Allowances and Certificates.
Reconciliations from Reported measures to Adjusted measures along with further description of the rationale for those adjustments are included in the Alternative Performance Measures section at pages 101 to 104.
Where the Group have referred to an Alternative Performance Measure in the financial statements the following sign is presented to denote this.
113 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2017 3.
Adjusted accounting measures continued 3.2 Exceptional items and certain re-measurements Exceptional items are those charges or credits that are considered unusual by nature and scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood.
The trigger points for exceptional items will tend to be nonrecurring although exceptional charges may impact the same asset class or segment over time.
Market conditions that have deteriorated significantly over time will only be captured to the extent observable at the balance sheet date.
Examples of items that may be considered exceptional include material asset or business impairment charges, business restructuring costs, significant gains or losses on disposal and contractual settlements following significant disputes and claims.
The Directors consider that any individual gain or loss on disposal of greater than 30.0m would be disclosed as being exceptional by nature of its scale.
Other gains or losses on disposal below this level may be considered to be exceptional by reference to specific circumstances which will be explained on a case-by-case basis.
Certain re-measurements are re-measurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are accounted for as held for trading or as fair value hedges in accordance with the Groups policy for such financial instruments.
The amounts shown in the before exceptional items and certain re-measurements results for these contracts is the amount settled in the year as disclosed in Note 24.1.
This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IAS 39 where held for the Groups own use requirements which are not recorded until the underlying commodity is delivered.
3.3 Other additional disclosures As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements, the Groups income statement discloses additional information in respect of joint ventures and associates, exceptional items and certain re-measurements to aid understanding of the Groups financial performance and to present results clearly and consistently.
Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements.
The Groups key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted with the most Significant Financial Judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately.
4.1 Significant financial judgements estimation uncertainties The preparation of these Financial Statements has specifically considered the following significant financial judgements all of which are areas of estimation uncertainty.
i Impairment testing and valuation of certain non-current assets estimation uncertainty The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets to determine whether any impairment of the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded.
The specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2017 are goodwill, intangible development assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets related to gas production, retail and technology development, gas storage, thermal power generation and wind power generation.
In conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering both the level of cash generating unit CGU at which common assets such as goodwill are assessed against, as well as the estimates and assumptions behind the calculation of recoverable amount of the respective assets or CGUs.
During the year, the Group performed a review of its CGUs based upon the current Group operating structure and economic characteristics of similar assets.
The review resulted in two CGUs GB Wind and Ireland Wind being combined into a Wind Generation CGU.
The other CGUs were unchanged following this review.
Changes to the estimates and assumptions on factors such as regulation and legislation changes, power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, expected proven and probable reserves, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Groups income statement and balance sheet.
Further detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used in the impairment review, the resulting impairment charges and the sensitivity of this assessment to key assumptions is disclosed at Note 15.
Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section A1.
ii Revenue recognition estimated energy consumption estimation uncertainty Revenue from Retail energy supply activities includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
This estimation will comprise of values for i billed revenue in relation to consumption from unread meters based on estimated consumption taking account of various factors including usage patterns and weather trends disclosed as trade receivables and ii unbilled revenue disclosed as accrued income.
The volume of unbilled electricity or gas is calculated by assessing a number of factors such as externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers from national settlements bodies, amounts billed to customers and other adjustments.
Unbilled revenue is therefore calculated by applying the tariffs associated with estimated customers to the calculated volume of electricity or gas consumed.
This estimation methodology is subject to an internal corroboration process that provides support for the judgements made by management.
This process requires the comparison of calculated unbilled volumes to a benchmark measure of unbilled volumes which is derived using independently verified data and by assessing historical weather-adjusted consumption patterns and actual meter data that is used in industry reconciliation processes for total consumption by supplier.
This aspect of the corroboration process, which requires a comparison of the estimated supplied quantity of electricity or gas that is deemed to have been delivered to customers and the aggregate supplied quantity of electricity or gas applicable to the Groups customers that is measured by industry system operators, is a key judgement.
Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued 4.1 Significant financial judgements estimation uncertainties continued The assessment of electricity unbilled revenue is further influenced by the impact on estimated electricity or gas supplied of national settlements data or, for electricity only, feed-in-tariff supported volumes and spill from solar PV generation.
The Groups policy is to recognise unbilled revenue only where the economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group.
As a result, the judgements applied, and the assumptions underpinning the judgements, are considered to be appropriate.
Change in these assumptions would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised in any given period.
In the year, in relation to electricity, the Group has been able to resolve a number of long-standing issues relating to the quality of grid supply point metering and national settlements data.
As a result, while significant estimation uncertainty remains, the aggregate level of non-half-hourly and half-hourly volume associated with such factors has reduced in the year.
This improvement in confidence in estimation has enabled an additional revenue amount of c. 60m 1.1% of unbilled energy income to be recognised in the year.
In relation to unbilled gas revenue estimation, the experience of the Group is that the industry estimated supplied quantities of gas consumed have historically been higher than actual metered supply.
To take account of this, the Group has applied a further judgement, being a percentage reduction to unbilled consumption volume, to the measurement of its unbilled revenue in the financial statements.
It is expected that this judgement will become less critical as the industry transitions to smart meter technology.
The sensitivity associated with this judgement factor is disclosed at Note 18. iii Valuation of trade receivables estimation uncertainty The Groups exposure to credit risk, and therefore the basis of determining the provisions for bad and doubtful debts, is explained within the Accompanying Information section A6 at pages 176 to 184.
While the provisions are considered to be appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of provisions recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to the income statement.
The analysis of the ageing of trade receivables, movement in the provision for bad and doubtful debts and the net trade receivables expected to be recoverable is detailed within the Accompanying Information section A6 at pages 176 to 184. iv Retirement benefit obligations estimation uncertainty The assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits during the period are based on the Groups best estimates and are set after consultation with qualified actuaries.
While these assumptions are believed to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the level of the retirement benefit obligation recorded and the cost to the Group of administering the schemes.
Further detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used, the resulting movements in obligations and the sensitivity of key assumptions to the obligation is disclosed at Note 23.
4.2 Other key accounting judgements Other key accounting judgements applied in the preparation of these Financial Statements include the following: i Business Combinations and acquisitions accounting judgement Business combinations and acquisitions require a fair value exercise to be undertaken to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based, to a certain extent, on managements judgement.
The amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of this purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities with any unallocated portion being recorded as goodwill.
Business combinations are disclosed in Note 12. ii Treatment of disputes and claims accounting judgement The Group is exposed to the risk of litigation, regulatory judgements and contractual disputes through the course of its normal operations.
The Group considers each instance separately in accordance with legal advice and will provide or disclose information as deemed appropriate.
Changes in the assumptions around the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources or the estimation of any obligation would change the values recognised in the financial statements.
Provisions for disputes and claims are disclosed in Note 20. iii Consolidation of interest in investments and trading arrangements accounting judgement Judgement is often required in assessing the level of control held by the Group in its investments or trading arrangements.
Depending on the balance of facts and circumstances in each case, the Group may either have control, joint control or significant influence over the entity or arrangement.
Where the Group has joint control of an arrangement, judgement is also required to assess whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture.
Clyde Windfarm Scotland In the prior financial year, the Group completed the sale of 49.9% of the equity in Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited Clyde.
Details of this transaction are included at Note 12.
As part of the Group providing project and contract management services for and 100% of the funding for the construction of the 172.8MW extension of the wind farm, the Group had retained rights around the engineering, procurement and construction of the extension and therefore concluded to confer power to control the relevant activities of Clyde to the Group.
As a consequence, this entity was fully consolidated into the Groups financial statements as a subsidiary at 31 March 2016.
On 13 May 2016, the Group agreed to waive those contractual rights which gave rise to the judgement that power to control the relevant activities existed over Clyde.
All other contractual arrangements remained in place.
As a consequence, the Group has since accounted for its interest in Clyde as that of an investment in an equity-accounted joint venture.
One of the impacts of the change to the consolidation basis was to remove the equivalent to the 200.7m of non-recourse borrowings held by Clyde at 31 March 2016 from the Groups consolidated 115 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2017 4.
Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued 4.2 Other key accounting judgements continued balance sheet and from the Groups Adjusted net debt and hybrid equity measure.
The principal adjustments made to reflect the change in consolidation basis on the date control was lost are noted below, and comprise the derecognition of the consolidated subsidiary balances, the reclassification of borrowings as loans to joint ventures, and the recognition of an equity investment in a joint venture at fair value as required by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Subsequent increases in loan, share of profits and other reserves as part of the normal course of business are also noted, giving a bridge to the recognised position at 31 March 2017.
The Group retains a 51% equity stake in Clyde at 31 March 2017 and the Groups interest in the entity is expected to remain that of an equity-accounted joint venture following completion of the extension.
On completion of the extension project, the Group expects to convert the loans provided relating to the extension to equity and will consequently hold an increased stake in the venture at that point.
Consolidation Derecognition Increase in Consolidation entries for control as subsidiary and Fair value uplift loan, share of entries for joint of Clyde at recognition as of equity interest profits and control of Clyde at conversion date joint venture under IFRS 10 other reserves 31 March 2017 m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 637.0 637.0 Equity investments in joint ventures and associates 85.1 59.1 3.6 147.8 Loans to joint ventures and associates 264.9 78.3 343.2 Non-current assets 637.0 287.0 59.1 81.9 491.0 Current assets 45.9 45.9 Current liabilities i 378.6 113.7 78.3 343.2 Loans and borrowings 200.7 200.7 Non-current liabilities 200.7 200.7 Net assets 103.6 18.5 59.1 3.6 147.8 i Closing current liabilities represents the cash paid by parent companies to Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited as loans.
All others Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited has been deemed a joint venture in the current and previous year due to any matters which significantly affect the operation and performance of the company requiring unanimous shareholder consent.
The Group holds a 40% equity stake at 31 March 2017.
The Groups interest in Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited is that of a joint operation designed to provide output to the parties sharing control.
The liabilities of the arrangement are principally met by the parties through the contracts for the output of the wind farm.
Further information on the Groups interest in joint arrangements and associates is given in Note 16. iv Lease classification for smart meter contracts accounting judgement Following the disposal of smart meter assets to Meter Fit 10 Limited in the period see Note 12, the Group has entered into an agreement for the provision of meter asset provider MAP services with that company.
During the year, the Group also entered into a framework agreement with a joint venture company, Maple Topco Limited, to provide MAP services for further tranches of smart meter deployment.
The Group has assessed that both arrangements, in common with all similar arrangements, do not contain leases due to other parties taking a significant amount of the output from the meters and due to the Group being unable to control either the operation or the physical access to the meters.
v Pension scheme surplus restrictions accounting judgement At 31 March 2016, the value of scheme assets recognised were impacted by the asset ceiling test which a restricts the surplus that could be recognised to assets that can be recovered through future refunds or reductions in future contributions to the schemes and b may increase the value of scheme liabilities where there are minimum funding liabilities in relation to agreed contributions.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction clarifies that future refunds may be recognised in the assessment of the asset ceiling if the sponsoring entity has an unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances.
During the financial year, the rules of the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme SHEPS were amended whereby the Groups rights to any surplus upon final winding up of the scheme were clarified.
This presented a change in circumstances such that the asset ceiling restriction to the SHEPS surplus is no longer applicable.
The impact of this assessment is disclosed in Note 23.
4.3 Other areas of estimation uncertainty i Provisions and contingencies The assessments undertaken in recognising provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with IAS 37.
Provisions are calculated based on estimations.
The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events has required best judgement by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss.
Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.
Provisions are disclosed in Note 20 and any contingencies are disclosed in Note 25.
Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued 4.3 Other areas of estimation uncertainty continued ii Decommissioning costs The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the useful lives of certain property, plant and equipment assets is reviewed periodically and has been reassessed in the year to 31 March 2017.
Decommissioning costs in relation to gas exploration and production assets are periodically agreed with the field Operators and reflect the latest expected economic production lives of the fields.
Provision is made for the estimated discounted cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date.
The dates for settlement of future decommissioning costs are uncertain, particularly for gas exploration and production assets where reassessment of gas and liquids reserves can lengthen or shorten the field life as well as the upward and downward movement in commodity prices and operating costs, but are currently expected to be incurred predominantly between 2017 and 2040.
Further detail on the assumptions made and movement in decommissioning costs during the year are disclosed at Note 20. iii Gas and liquids reserves The volume and production profile of proven and probable 2P gas and liquids reserves is an estimate that affects the unit of production depreciation of producing gas and liquids property, plant and equipment.
This is also a significant input estimate to the associated impairment and decommissioning calculations.
The estimation of gas and liquid reserves is subject to change between reporting periods, following the review and updating of inputs such as regional activity, geological data, reservoir performance data, well drilling activity, commodity prices and production costs.
Proven and probable 2P reserves, and other reserve classifications out-with 2P, can both increase and decrease following assessment of the inputs.
The estimates of gas and liquid reserves are formally reviewed on an annual basis using an Independent Reserves Auditor, and the impact of a change in estimated proven and probable reserves is dealt with prospectively by depreciating the remaining book value of producing assets over the expected future production.
If proven and probable reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be affected by an immediate write-down impairment of the assets book value or a higher future depreciation expense.
Further detail on the assumptions made are disclosed at Note 15.
Segmental information The Groups operating segments are those used internally by the Board to run the business and make strategic decisions.
The types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are: Business Area Reported Segments Description Networks Electricity Distribution The economically regulated lower voltage distribution of electricity to customer premises in the North of Scotland and the South of England.

Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued 7.1 Exceptional items In the year to 31 March 2017, the Group recognised a net exceptional charge of 8.2m.
This consisted of asset impairment and related charges totalling 376.4m, net exceptional credits for provisions of 1.8m, net exceptional gains on disposal of 307.3m 2016 57.6m and net fair value uplift following loss of control of 59.1m 2016 nil.
The 307.3m gain on the part disposal of the Groups stake in Scotia Gas Networks is commented upon at Note 12.
The net exceptional charges excluding gains on disposal recognised can be summarised as follows: Property, Goodwill plant and and other Provisions equipment intangibles Inventories & other Total Note 14 Note 13 Note 17 charges charges m m m m m Gas Production i 244.3 20.0 3.2 227.5 Retail and technology development ii 42.2 78.1 120.3 Gas Storage iii 23.8 23.8 Thermal Generation iv 30.7 62.3 31.6 Other v 12.0 36.4 13.8 34.6 353.0 94.5 62.3 10.6 374.6 i Gas Production.
Significant impairment charges associated with the groups North Sea Gas Production assets have been recognised in 2016 17.
An exceptional charge of 180.5m has been recognised in relation to the Greater Laggan field following a reduction in the independently assessed quantity of available proved and probable 2P hydrocarbon resources.
This reserves re-assessment considered the reserves recognisable under likely production and took into account reserve shrinkage and contingent resource increases.
In addition, an impairment charge of 63.8m has been recognised in relation to Bacton field assets predominantly as a result of higher than previously assessed decommissioning costs for the field which were deemed to be irrecoverable through the remaining economic life.
Against these charges, an exceptional credit of 20.0m has been recognised in relation to previously impaired intangible development assets in the Greater Laggan development area.
This followed the identification of additional prospective resources for that development which, on a risk adjusted basis, has resulted in the reversal of prior year exceptional charges.
The exceptional charges recognised in 2016 17 primarily relate to revised assessments of economic reserves as opposed to the market price driven impairment charges recognised in 2015 16.
Following these charges and credit and the utilisation of field resources in the year, the residual value of the Groups gas production assets is 679.8m.
ii Retail and other technology developments.
During the year the Group decided to cease the development of its replacement customer service and billing system.
As a result of this strategic decision, all amounts capitalised in relation to the development of the system and related software and hardware have been impaired and with the resulting impact being recognised as an exceptional charge of 83.1m.
At the same time, the Group conducted a detailed review of related technology development projects and identified a further 37.2m of projects development which would be discontinued.
Due to the significant nature of this assessment, a combined charge of 120.3m has been recognised.
These impairments charges are recognised against both intangible development projects 78.1m and property, plant and equipment 42.2m.
During the course of the year management revised their assessment of the anticipated decommissioning costs associated with the Aldbrough and Atwick Gas Storage sites.
This concluded that an additional decommissioning provision of 23.8m was required.
Due to the ongoing issues at the plants and in common with previous assessments of those facilities, the consequential increase in asset values has been impaired.
The carrying value of Gas Storage assets at 31 March 2017 is 19.6m, with a discounted decommissioning provision of 41.9m.
As part of the Groups impact assessment of the imminent changes to the Integrated Single Electricity Market I-SEM on the island of Ireland, it reassessed the value-in-use of its thermal generation portfolio in Ireland.
This review concluded that the Groups oil burning stations at Rhode and Tawnaghmor were impaired due to their age and future competitive prospects.
The impairment for these assets amounted to 30.7m.
The residual value of thermal plants in Ireland is 384.4m.
In its financial statements to March 2016, the Group recognised significant impairments relating to the Fiddlers Ferry power station due to ongoing uncertainty relating to its future operations despite the success in securing a contract to provide ancillary capacity services for one year to March 2017.
In the financial year to March 2017 the plant was able to operate more than projected due to positive dark spread margins being available in winter 2016 17.
As a result of this unexpected running, the plant has been able to utilise the coal stocks it had previously impaired and has consequently reversed its previous impairment of inventory creating an exceptional credit of 62.3m in 2016 17.
However, in the context of the low settlement price in the January 2017 capacity auction for coal plants for 2017 18, the future prospects for the plant remain uncertain and consequently the net book value of Fiddlers Ferry remains nil.
The carrying value of GB gas-fired power stations at 31 March 2017 was 181.2m.
Following reassessment of The Energy Services Group ESG s deployment within SSE, the Group has concluded that an impairment adjustment against the goodwill recognised on acquisition of 36.4m is necessary.
Further detail is included at Note 15.
In addition, the Group has assessed its position in relation to various legal claims and disputes.
Consequently, a number of exceptional charges 18.2m and credits 20.0m have been recognised.
These have been classified as exceptional due to their previous recognition as such in previous financial years or based on their characteristics.
The net impact of these items is an exceptional credit of 1.8m.
125 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2017 7.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued 7.1 Exceptional items continued 31 March 2016 In the previous financial year, the Group recognised exceptional charges arising from and related to asset impairments amounting to 892.5m and provisions of 54.9m.
The exceptional charges recognised can be summarised as follows: Property, plant Goodwill and Total and equipment other intangibles Inventories Other impairment Provisions Total Note 14 Note 13 Note 17 charges related Note 20 charges m m m m m m m Coal Generation 67.6 87.9 83.2 238.7 48.3 287.0 Gas Generation 302.5 2.2 3.7 18.0 326.4 326.4 Gas Production 125.0 27.2 9.6 161.8 161.8 Gas Storage 150.9 150.9 150.9 Other 11.2 3.5 14.7 6.6 21.3 646.0 40.6 91.6 114.3 892.5 54.9 947.4 In 2015 16, the Group announced the closure of Ferrybridge and highlighted significant uncertainty in relation to ongoing operations at Fiddlers Ferry.
These consequently gave rise to impairment and other charges totalling 287.0m.
As noted, the 2016 17 operational performance at Fiddlers Ferry outturn was more positive than previously anticipated and gave rise to certain impairment reversals.
The Groups gas-fired generation plants at Peterhead, Medway and Marchwood were impaired in 2015 16 due to difficult economic conditions and factors such as the withdrawal of support for the proposed carbon capture and storage project at Peterhead.
More broadly, no observable recovery in spark spread margins were forecast.
In total, impairment and other charges of 326.4m were recognised in relation to gas generation.
No further deterioration in the values of GB gas plants was observed in the financial year to 31 March 2017 see Note 15.
In 2015 16, impairment charges totalling 161.8m were recognised in relation to the Groups Gas Exploration and Production assets in the North Sea, predominately due to declining wholesale gas prices.
The exceptionals charges recognised included an element 121.2m relating to the impairment of Greater Laggan field assets acquired at 28 October 2016 which reflected the impact of the decline in expected long-term gas prices between the acquisition date and the financial year end.
The groups gas storage assets at Hornsea Atwick and Aldbrough saw reduced short-term price volatility and seasonal spreads in the wholesale gas market, which created exceptional charges relating to plant value.
31 March 2015 In the year to 31 March 2015, the Group recognised exceptional charges arising from and related to asset impairments amounting to 667.5m and provisions of 56.0m.
The exceptional charges recognised can be summarised as follows: Total Property, plant Goodwill and Other impairment Total and equipment other intangibles Inventories charges related Provisions charges m m m m m m m Coal Generation 222.7 41.0 45.8 309.5 4.0 313.5 Gas Generation 14.9 51.5 66.4 10.0 76.4 Gas Production 61.9 44.1 0.1 106.1 106.1 Gas Storage 162.4 162.4 1.5 163.9 Other 16.9 6.2 23.1 40.5 63.6 478.8 95.6 41.0 52.1 667.5 56.0 723.5 The impairments of Coal generation plants followed the 31 July 2015 fire at Ferrybridge and the inability of both units at Ferrybridge and one unit at Fiddlers Ferry to secure agreements to provide capacity under the auction process run by DECC in December 2015.
The impairments of Gas generation plants predominately related to development sites at Abernedd and Seabank.
The impairments of Gas Production assets related to the impact of declining wholesale prices on the Groups Sean, ECA and Lomond fields.
The charges associated with Gas Storage followed the strategic review of the Groups operations in that segment the results of which were announced on 26 March 2016.
The other charges mainly relate to asset impairments, other charges in non-core businesses and provisions for certain disputes and claims.
The exceptional disposal gains recorded related to the sale of seven street lighting PFI companies to Equitix 38.0m, the Groups share of the dividend from the Environmental Energy Funds disposal of its stake in Anesco 19.6m and the gain on disposal of non-core retail assets 17.2m.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued 7.
2 Certain re-measurements The Group enters into forward commodity purchase and sales contracts to meet the future demand requirements of its Energy Supply business and to optimise the value of its Generation and other Wholesale assets.
Certain of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IAS 39 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as IAS 39 financial instruments are reflected in the income statement as part of certain re-measurements.
The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.
The Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominately be within the subsequent 12 to 18 months.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
The re-measurements arising from IAS 39 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
This category also includes the income statement movement on financing derivatives and hedged items as described in Note 24.
7.3 Change in UK corporation tax rates Finance No.
2 Act 2015 which received royal assent on 18 November 2015 enacted a corporation tax rate of 19% currently 20% from 1 April 2017, and a rate of 18% from 1 April 2020.
A further change to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020 was announced in Finance Act 2016, as this change was enacted on 15 September 2016 it has the effect of reducing the Groups deferred tax liabilities by 34.6m including the impact of changes recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Finance Act 2016 announced a reduction in the rate of Supplementary Charge on ring-fenced profits to 10% previously 20% with effect from 1 January 2016.
As this change was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016 it has the effect of reducing the Groups deferred tax liabilities by 0.8m.
Taxation The Group has separately recognised the tax effect of the exceptional items and certain re-measurements summarised above.

As a consequence, these financial statements include a number of areas of enhanced disclosure which have been provided in order to develop stakeholder understanding of the tax the Group pays and the Reported total taxation charge along with additional commentary on the main reconciling items.
These can be seen at Section A2.
Taxation continued 10.1 Analysis of charge recognised in the income statement continued The majority of the Groups profits are earned in the UK, with the standard rate of UK corporation tax being 20% for the year to 31 March 2017 2016 20%.
The Groups Gas Production business is taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 10% combined 40%.
In addition, profits from the Sean gas field were subject to petroleum revenue tax PRT at 0% from 1 January 2016 which is deductible against corporation tax, giving an overall effective rate for the field of 40%.
Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.
Deferred tax has been recognised at 35% in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme surplus, as there is insufficient certainty over how the surplus will reverse.
If a special repayment is made to the company, withholding tax of 35% applies.
Deferred tax on pension scheme deficits has previously been booked at the standard UK Corporation Tax rate.
The Adjusted current tax charge and the Adjusted effective rate of tax, which are presented in order to best represent underlying performance by making similar adjustments to the Adjusted profit before tax measure, are arrived at after the following adjustments: 2017 2017 2016 2016 m % m % Group tax charge and effective rate 57.8 3.6 8.1 2.1 Add: Reported deferred tax credit and effective rate 58.6 3.7 107.0 27.5 Reported current tax charge and effective rate 116.4 7.3 115.1 29.6 Effect of adjusting items 0.2 22.0 Reported current tax charge on Adjusted basis 116.4 7.5 115.1 7.6 Add: Share of current tax from joint ventures and associates 30.8 2.0 34.1 2.3 Less: Current tax credit on exceptional items 10.5 0.7 44.2 2.9 Adjusted current tax charge and effective rate 157.7 10.2 193.4 12.8 Tax charge credit recognised in other comprehensive income loss : 2017 2016 m m Relating to: Pension scheme actuarial movements 168.8 58.9 Cash flow and net investment hedge movements 0.8 7.8 168.0 66.7 All tax recognised through other comprehensive income is deferred tax.

3 Deferred taxation continued Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset, including the asset balances analysed in the tables above.
The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2017 2016 m m Deferred tax liabilities 788.9 917.5 Deferred tax assets 322.3 512.0 Net deferred tax liabilities assets 466.6 405.5 The deferred tax assets disclosed include the deferred tax relating to the Groups pension scheme liabilities.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are recorded as part of the Groups share of investment in those entities.
The aggregate amount of these is a charge, excluding exceptional items and re-measurement, of 6.5m 2016 40.5m charge.
A deferred tax asset of 112.2m 2016 21.1m has not been recognised on trading losses due to uncertainty around the availability of future profits in the companies concerned.

Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the cash dividend under the terms of the Companys scrip dividend scheme.
An interim dividend of 27.4p per ordinary share 2016 26.9p was declared and paid on 17 March 2017 to those shareholders on the SSE plc share register on 20 January 2017.
Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the interim cash dividend under the terms of the Companys scrip dividend scheme.
The proposed final dividend of 63.9p per ordinary share based on the number of issued ordinary shares at 31 March 2017 is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Based on shares in issue at 31 March 2017, this would equate to a final dividend of 649.0m.
11.2 Basic and Adjusted earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share at 31 March 2017 is based on the net profit attributable to Ordinary shareholders and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 March 2017.
All earnings are from continuing operations.
Adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the charge for deferred tax, interest on net pension liabilities under IAS 19R and the impact of exceptional items and certain re-measurements Note 7.

Acquisitions, disposals and held-for-sale assets 12.1 Acquisitions The Group increased its share in the Dogger Bank Offshore Wind development on 24 March 2017 following an acquisition of an additional 12.5% stake from former consortium partner Statkraft for consideration of 15.8m.
This takes SSEs share of the project to 37.5%.
In addition the Group reversed a previous impairment of 10.7m in respect of the project within other intangible assets Note 13.
The Dogger Bank offshore wind development comprises four projects which are located in the North Sea off the east coast of England and has a potential generating capacity of up to 4,800MW.
Due to the development being assessed as being a joint operation, the purchase price has been wholly allocated against development assets within intangible assets.
12.2 Disposals i Significant disposals On 26 October 2016, the Group completed the disposal of a 16.7% equity stake in Scotia Gas Networks SGN to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ADIA.
After transaction costs and adjustments, cash consideration received was 615.1m and an exceptional gain on sale of 307.3m was recognised on disposal.
Following the divestment, the Group will retain a 33.3% equity stake in SGN.
These assets were not held for sale at 31 March 2016.
The 16.7% stake of SGN sold contributed 34.2m to the Groups Reported profits in the current financial year.
ii Other disposals On 21 January 2016, the company sold a 10% share in Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited to CI Beatrice I Limited and CI Beatrice II Limited split equally between the two entities for total consideration of 31.7m of which 21.2m was deferred.
The deferred element of the consideration was contingent on certain events occurring after the balance sheet date.
Following confirmation of those events, in May 2016, the Group received net cash proceeds of 31.7m which also included an element of deferred consideration associated with a prior divestment 10.5m.
133 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2017 12.
Acquisitions, disposals and held-for-sale assets 12.2 Disposals continued The Group consequently recognised a 20.3m gain on disposal in the current year.
This was deemed not to be exceptional due to the value being below the Groups stated criteria for such items see Note 2 ii.
On 26 May 2016, the Group disposed of 43.5m of smart meter assets to Meter Fit 10 Limited for cash consideration equal to book value resulting in nil gain loss on disposal and, at the same time, entered into a contract with the purchaser for meter asset services.
The assets disposed were held for sale at 31 March 2016.
On 30 March 2017, the Group completed the disposal of its stake in three Tay Valley Streetlighting joint ventures in Leeds, Stoke and Newcastle to DIF Infra 4 UK Limited for net consideration of 40.4m, resulting in a gain on sale of 2.2m.
This was deemed not to be exceptional due to the value being below the Groups stated criteria for such items see Note 3.2.
This disposal reduced the Groups Reported net debt by 129.4m.
These assets were held for sale at 31 March 2016. iii Disposal reconciliation The following table summarises all businesses and assets disposed of during the financial year, including those not previously held for sale and including other assets and investments disposed of as part of the normal course of business and which are noted in the relevant respective notes to the financial statements.

i Due to the consolidation, at 31 March 2016, of Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited, the Group required to recognise 200.7m of non-recourse borrowings due from Clyde to other shareholders.
Consequently, this balance was excluded from Adjusted net debt and hybrids at that date with cash proceeds from the Clyde transaction being presented gross.
The change in consolidation status of Clyde from 13 May 2016 means that this presentation is not applicable to the 31 March 2017.
Further commentary is provided at Note 4.2 iii.
Acquisitions, disposals and held-for-sale assets continued 12.3 Held-for-sale assets and liabilities A number of assets and liabilities associated with activities are deemed available for immediate sale and have been separately presented on the face of the balance sheet at 31 March 2017.
The assets have been stated at their fair value less costs to sell.
The assets and liabilities classified as held for sale, and the comparative balances at 31 March 2017, are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Property, plant and equipment 63.6 Other intangible 27.9 Derivative financial assets 2.7 Non-current assets 66.3 27.9 Trade and other receivables 106.3 Derivative financial assets 4.1 Current assets 4.1 106.3 Total assets 70.4 134.2 Loans and borrowings 11.2 Trade and other payables 5.9 Current liabilities 17.1 Loans and borrowings 97.9 Deferred tax liabilities 1.4 Non-current liabilities 1.4 97.9 Total liabilities 1.4 115.0 Net assets 69.0 19.2 The Group has recognised 14.3m of operating wind farm assets as held for sale at 31 March 2017.
The other held for sale items relate to 50% of the assets and liabilities of Ferrybridge MFE 2 Limited.
This subsidiary is responsible for the development of a 70MW multi fuel power plant situated close to the operating multi fuel joint venture at Ferrybridge in which SSE has a 50% stake.
SSE currently owns 100% of Ferrybridge MFE 2 Limited but has a contractual agreement, subject to various contingent matters, to dispose of 50% of the share capital of the company to the joint venture partner of the initial multi fuel facility.
This transaction is anticipated to take place within the next year.
The aggregated pre-tax profit contribution of the held for sale assets and businesses in the year to 31 March 2017 was nil 2016 1.8m.
During the prior items held for sale related to the remaining streetlighting activities of the group, these assets were sold during March 2017.
Other assets held for sale were smart meter assets, these were sold to Meter Fit 10 Limited in April 2016.
12.4 Acquisitions and disposals in the previous year i Acquisitions in the previous year On 28 October 2015, the Group through its wholly owned subsidiary, SSE E&P UK Limited, acquired a 20% interest in the four gas fields known as the Greater Laggan Area, along with a 20% interest in the Shetland Gas Terminal, from Total E&P UK Limited.
The cash consideration paid for the business was 669.0m.
ii Disposals in the previous year On 29 October 2015, the Group agreed to sell its shareholding in Galloper Wind Farm Limited to its co-venturer RWE Innogy for cash consideration of 18.3m.
The gain on the disposal of 18.3m was recorded as an exceptional item.
On 28 May 2015, the Group also agreed to sell three onshore wind development sites Cour, Blackcraig, Whiteside Hill, 98MW to Blue Energy.
Total consideration for these assets was 52.4m.
Consequently, an exceptional gain on disposal of 39.3m was recorded.
On 18 March 2016, the Group sold a 49.9% stake in its wholly owned operational 349.6MW Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited to Greencoat UK Wind Holdco Limited UKW and GLIL Corporate Holdings Limited GLIL for cash consideration of 339.2 million after costs.
At 31 March 2016, the stake held by the co-investors was deemed to be that of a non-controlling interest in an entity under the Groups control.
This key accounting judgement is explained at Note 4.2 iii.
The consequence of that judgement was that the gain recorded on disposal of 138.6m was recognised directly in equity instead of in the income statement and the non-recourse to SSE loans in the entity required to be recorded on the Group balance sheet.
Following amendments to the shareholders agreements between SSE, UKW and GLIL on 13 May 2016, SSE changed its accounting of Clyde Windfarm to an equity accounted joint venture.
135 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2017 13.
Non exceptional impairments of development assets relate to windfarm development projects no longer determined as viable.
ii The non exceptional write back of 10.7m was recognised following the Groups investment in the Doggerbank project, indicating development expenditure previously impaired should be reinstated.
Intangible assets have been analysed as current and non-current as follows: 2017 2016 m m Current 580.7 500.1 Non-current 760.4 859.4 1,341.1 1,359.5 SSE plc Annual Report 2017 136 1.
Other intangible assets continued i Goodwill At inception, goodwill arising from business combinations is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing purposes.
Certain goodwill valuations have changed in the current year following retranslation.
Commentary on the impairment testing of the related CGUs with the exception of two historic balances totalling 18.5m see Note 15 is included below.
A summary of the goodwill allocated to CGUs and the Groups operating segments is presented below: 2017 2016 Cash-generating unit Operating segment m m Windfarms i Energy Portfolio Management and Electricity Generation 324.6 324.4 GB Energy Supply Energy Supply 187.0 187.0 Enterprise Energy Solutions ii Enterprise and Energy-related Services 47.9 90.3 Ireland Supply iii Energy Supply 8.2 8.2 567.7 609.9 i During the year, the Group performed a review of its CGUs based upon the current Group operating structure and the economic characteristics of similar assets.
The goodwill balances in question arose from the attribution on acquisition of goodwill on acquisition of Airtricity plc.
The impact on the impairment review in the current year is described at Note 15.3. ii Enterprise Energy Solutions includes goodwill balances arising from historic acquisitions of Telecoms and Contracting businesses of 10.3m and a further 37.6m in relation to the acquisition of Energy Solutions Group ESG.
The amount of goodwill associated with the historic businesses is not significant in context of the aggregate carrying value of the business units or the aggregate value of goodwill held by the Group.
An exceptional impairment of 36.4m and non-exceptional impairment of 6.0m, has been recognised in relation to ESG, see Note 15.
The non-exceptional impairment relates to deferred consideration no longer required to be paid by the Group.
iii The value associated with the Ireland supply goodwill represents deferred tax recognised on the difference between the fair value attributed to the Northern Ireland-based Phoenix Energy business acquired in 2012 and the book value of those assets.
No impairment has been recognised during the year on this balance.
ii Allowances and certificates Allowances and Certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates ROCs.
These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Groups Energy Supply and Generation businesses.
iii Development assets Development costs relate to the design, construction and testing of thermal and renewable generation sites and devices, including wind farms, which the Group believes will generate probable future economic benefits.
Costs capitalised as development intangibles include options over land rights, planning application costs, environmental impact studies and other costs incurred in bringing wind farm and other generation and network development projects to the consented stage.
These may be costs incurred directly or at a cost as part of the fair value attribution on acquisition.
Development assets also include the Groups exploration and evaluation expenditure in relation to North Sea gas production wells.
At the point the development reaches the consent stage and is approved for construction, the carrying value is transferred to Property, Plant and Equipment Note 14.
At the point a project is no longer expected to reach the consented stage, the carrying amount of the project is impaired.
An exceptional credit of 20.0m has been recognised in relation to prospect assets at Greater Laggan based on reassessed additional prospective resources.
This represents a partial reversal of the prior year impairment.
In the prior year exceptional impairment charges of 29.4m were recognised in relation to the impairment of E&P prospect developments due to the impact decline in wholesale gas prices on the Gas Production segment 27.2m and CCS development asset-related impairment charges recognised as part of the overall exceptional impairment of Peterhead power station 2.2m.
iv Other intangible assets Included within other intangible assets are brands, customer lists, contracts, application software license fees, software development work, software upgrades and purchased PC software packages.
Amortisation is over the shorter of the contract term or five years with the exception of certain application software assets, which are amortised over 10 years.
Exceptional impairment charges have been recognised in relation to Retail and other technology developments of 78.1m see Note 7.
In the prior year exceptional impairment charges of 11.2m were recognised in relation to software developments in Energy-related Services.
137 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2017 14.
The net book value of power generation assets includes decommissioning costs with a net book value of 123.2m 2016 161.0m which includes an increase following a review of all portfolio decommissioning liabilities see Note 20. ii Gas storage and production assets include decommissioning costs with a net book value of 130.9m 2016 205.3m.
iii Assets disposed of include 637.0m in respect of Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited following a change in accounting treatment during the current year, see Note 4.2 iii.
Other disposals were related to other equipment.

Impairment testing The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment PP&E, goodwill and other intangible assets and its interests in joint ventures and associates annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amounts may be lower than their carrying amounts or where other indicators of impairment are deemed to have arisen.
The Groups accounting policies and methodologies for impairment testing are described at Accompanying Information Sections A1.2.
15.1 Goodwill impairment reviews CGUs testing The recoverable amounts of the Windfarms, GB Energy Supply and Enterprise Energy Solutions CGUs are determined by reference to value-in-use VIU calculations.
The VIU calculations use, as a starting point, pre-tax cash flow projections based both on the Groups five year Corporate Model as approved by the Board.
The Groups Corporate Model is based both on past experience and reflects the Groups forward view of markets, prices, risks and its strategic objectives.
Commodity prices used are based on observable market data and, where this is not available, on internal estimates.
15.2 PP&E, other intangibles and investment impairment reviews asset testing The recoverable amounts of the Groups PP&E, other intangible assets and interests in joint ventures and associates are determined by reference to VIU calculations.
The calculations use, as their starting point, pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Groups five year Corporate Model as approved by the Board.
The Groups Corporate Model is based on past experience and reflects the Groups forward view of markets, prices, risks and its strategic objectives.
15.3 Impairment reviews The key operating and valuation assumptions, specific considerations and outcome of tests for all impairment reviews are noted in the following table.
The discount rates used are pre-tax real, except where noted, and reflect specific risks attributable to the relevant operating segments.
The discount rates used have been benchmarked against externally published rates used by comparable quoted companies operating in the respective market sectors.
The discount rates applied in both 2017 and 2016 remain consistent across all CGUs, except where noted, reflecting the Groups view of cost of capital and risk.
The recoverable amounts derived from the VIU or FVLCS calculations are compared to the carrying amount of each asset or CGU to determine whether an impairment charge requires to be recognised.
The reviews carried out for the 2017 accounts were carried out in the fourth quarter of the year, which is consistent with previous reviews.
Note that the actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions included in the assessments at the balance sheet date.
All assets and CGUs under review are in the Wholesale business with the exception of the impairment review of the goodwill associated with the Energy Services Group ESG which is a business in Enterprise and the goodwill held in relation to the GB Energy Supply business.

The Group estimates the value of residual electricity consumption uncertainty at the year end is around 25.0m.
The Group also applies a percentage reduction to consumption estimates in relation to gas to take account of inaccuracies in the industry settlement process which have historically allocated more volume to the Group than has been recovered through subsequent billings.

Estimates are based on the forecast remediation or clean-up costs at the projected date of decommissioning and are discounted for the time value of money.
During the year, the Group increased the decommissioning liabilities held in respect of its Gas Storage sites at Atwick and Aldbrough by 23.8m.
This increase and certain other increases relating to decommissioning of Gas Production fields 63.8m resulted in a consequential exceptional impairment of the associated property, plant and equipment values Note 7.
Further increases of 18.6m were recognised relating to reassessments of provisions for windfarm and thermal generation assets.
ii The Group holds provisions in relation to certain long-term construction contracts.
This includes the Groups retained sub-contracts with the various street-lighting PFI companies that have been disposed during the current and prior year.
iii Restructuring includes provisions related to the closure and exit of operations such as the Groups Ferrybridge power station and retail shops.
iv Other provisions relate to costs associated with licence condition investigations, claims and disputes and the employer financed retirement benefit provision for certain directors and former directors and employees, which is valued in accordance with IAS 19.
During the year a net exceptional credit of 13.8m was recognised in relation to changes in expected outcomes in certain claims and disputes being 20.0m release and 6.2m charge.
Sources of finance 21.1 Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit rating so as to support investor, counterparty and market confidence in the Group and to underpin future development of the business.
The Groups credit ratings are also important in maintaining an efficient cost of capital and in determining collateral requirements throughout the Group.
As at 31 March 2017, the Groups long-term credit rating was A-negative outlook for Standard & Poors and A3 stable outlook for Moodys.
The maintenance of a medium-term corporate model is a key control in monitoring the development of the Groups capital structure, and allows for detailed scenarios and sensitivity testing.
Key ratios drawn from this analysis underpin regular updates to the Board and include the ratios used by the rating agencies in assessing the Groups credit ratings.
The Group has the option to purchase its own shares from the market.
The timing of these purchases will depend on market prices and economic conditions.
As part of the utilisation of the proceeds from its disposal of a 16.7% stake in Scotia Gas Networks, the Group announced on 11 November 2016 that it would commence a discretionary programme to purchase its own shares for cancellation or to be held in treasury.
This programme commenced on 11 November 2016 and is due to complete no later than 31 December 2017.
The aggregate purchase price of all shares acquired under the programme will be no greater than 500.0m and no more than 100,759,681 shares.
The purpose of the programme is to reduce the share capital of the Company.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group had completed the on-market repurchase and cancellation of 8.9 million of its shares in the period to 31 March 2017 for total cash outlay of 131.5m.
See further detail within Note 22.
The Groups debt requirements are principally met through issuing bonds denominated in Sterling and Euros as well as private placements and medium-term bank loans including those with the European Investment Bank.
In the financial year the Group received 501m relating to a US private placement which was singed ahead of the 31 March 2016 year end.
Also the Group issued hybrid securities which bring together features of both debt and equity of 1.0bn.
As these securities have a fixed redemption date these are accounted for as debt see Note 21.3 ii.
The securities are different from the hybrid securities previously issued which were perpetual and subordinate to all senior creditors and which are accounted for as equity see Note 22.5.
The Group currently has 1.7bn of committed bank facilities of which 1.5bn relates to the Groups revolving credit and bilateral facilities that can be accessed at short notice for use in managing the Groups short-term funding requirements however, these committed facilities remain undrawn for the majority of the time.
The remaining 0.2bn relates to a new EIB facility that was signed in March 17 with a 12 month drawing period that, once drawn, will convert to being a 10 year term loan.
The Group capital comprises: 2017 2016 m m Total borrowings excluding finance leases 7,805.5 6,868.0 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 1,427.0 360.2 Net debt excluding hybrid equity 6,378.5 6,507.8 Hybrid equity 2,209.7 2,209.7 Cash held as collateral and other short-term loans 105.2 121.8 Balances due to partners in Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited 200.7 Adjusted net debt and hybrids 8,483.0 8,395.0 Equity attributable to shareholders of the parent 4,062.8 2,984.8 Total capital excluding finance leases 12,545.8 11,379.8 Under the terms of its major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply with the following financial covenant: Interest Cover Ratio: The Group shall procure that the ratio of Operating Profit to Net Interest Payable for any relevant period is not less than 2.5 to 1.
The following definitions apply in the calculation of these financial covenants: Operating Profit means, in relation to a relevant period, the profit on ordinary activities before taxation after adding back Net Interest Payable of the Group for that relevant period but after adjusting this amount to exclude any exceptional profits or losses and, for the avoidance of doubt, before taking account of any extraordinary profits or losses and excluding the effect of IAS 39.
Net Interest Payable means, in respect of any relevant period, interest payable during that relevant period less interest receivable during that relevant period.
In summary, the Groups intent is to balance returns to shareholders between current returns through dividends and long-term capital investment for growth.
In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the current economic environment prudently.
There were no changes to the Groups capital management approach during the year.

The cash and cash equivalents are higher year on year due to the early refinancing of 1.0bn hybrids maturing in October 17.
On 13 May 2016, following amendments to the shareholders agreement for Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited, the Groups investment is now recorded as an equity accounted joint venture.
Consequently, the non-recourse debt associated with the non-controlling interests in the entity is not consolidated in the Group balance sheet and is therefore no longer a reconciling item between Reported and Adjusted net debt and hybrids.
Please see further detail at Note 4.2 iii.
3 Borrowing facilities The Group has an established 1.5bn Euro commercial paper programme paper can be issued in a range of currencies and swapped into sterling and as at 31 March 2017 no commercial paper was outstanding 2016 198.8m.
During the year the Group extended its existing 1.5bn revolving credit and bilateral facilities by invoking the one year extension options with the facilities now maturing in August 2021 1.3bn and November 2021 0.2bn.
These facilities continue to provide back up to the commercial paper programme and, as at 31 March 2017, they were undrawn.
The Group has a further 200m facility available with the European Investment Bank which will be fully drawn during 2017 when it will become a 10 year term loan.
3 Borrowing facilities continued i Balances include term loans and EIB debt and is a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt.
ii The fair value adjustment relates to the change in the carrying amount of the borrowings as a result of fair value hedges that are in place.
The movement in the fair value adjustment is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding movement on the hedging instrument also being recognised in the income statement.
iii The weighted average interest rates including the effect of interest rate swaps for the year ended 31 March 2017 was 3.66% 2016 3.73%.
iv The 2.375% 500m Eurobond maturing 10 February 2022 has been swapped to Sterling giving an effective interest rate of 3.53%.
v The 1.75% 700m Eurobond maturing 8 September 2023 has been swapped to Sterling giving an effective interest rate of 3.16%.
vi The 4.75% $900m non call 5.5 year hybrid debt maturing 16 September 2077 has been swapped to Euros $605m and Sterling $295m giving an effective interest rate of 2.25% and 3.29% respectively.
i Finance lease liabilities Future finance lease commitments are as follows: Present value of minimum Minimum lease payments lease payments 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Amounts payable: Within one year 55.5 53.9 23.6 24.5 Between one and five years 206.3 215.2 118.3 110.9 After five years 177.3 225.8 135.0 165.4 439.1 494.9 276.9 300.8 Less: future finance charge 162.2 194.1 Present value of lease obligations 276.9 300.8 The Group has a power purchase agreement with a related party, Marchwood Power Limited, which is categorised as a finance lease.
The lease is for use of Marchwood Powers main asset, an 890MW Gas powered CCGT Electricity Generating Plant.
The term of the lease is 15 years with the Group having the option for a further 5 years extension at the end of this period.
23.6m 2016 19.0m of contingent rents paid under the lease were included within cost of sales for the period.
Contingent rent consists of MWh charges for availability of the plant for energy production and a MWh charge for actual nominated energy produced.
Of the remaining finance leases held by the group, the average remaining term of the telecom leases is 6 years.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments for these leases.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets.
The Company does not have any obligations under finance leases.
ii Hybrid debt On 16 March 2017, the Group issued 1.0bn of new hybrid debt securities.
Those hybrid debt securities have an issuer first call date on 1 October 2017 and are able to be redeemed at the Groups discretion.
This dual tranche issue comprises 300m with a coupon of 3.625% and $900m with a coupon of 4.75%.
The $900m tranche has been swapped back to both Euros and Sterling, bringing the all-in rate down to 2.72% and resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches to SSE of 3.02% per annum.
This compares favourably to the all-in funding cost of 4.02% achieved on SSEs most recent hybrid equity securities issued in 2015.
The intent is to use the proceeds to replace SSEs hybrid issued in 2012 at an all-in rate of 5.6%, which has an issuer first call date on 1 October 2017.
Due to the hybrids having a fixed redemption date, they have been accounted for as a debt item and are included within Loans and Other Borrowings in Note 21.2.
This is in contrast to the previous hybrid issues which have no fixed redemption date and are accounted for as Equity, see Note 22.5.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
i Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares in place of the final dividend of 62.5p per ordinary share in relation to year ended 31 March 2016 and the interim dividend of 27.4p in relation to the current year under the terms of the Companys scrip dividend scheme.
This resulted in the issue of 9,395,092 and 6,324,986 new fully paid ordinary shares respectively 2016 10,600,639 and 1,172,973.
In addition, the Company issued 1.2m 2016 2.8m shares during the year under the savings-related share option schemes for a consideration of 13.8m 2016 25.0m.
ii As referred to at Note 21.1, during the current financial year following the disposal of a stake in Scotia Gas Networks, the Company initiated a share buy back programme under which 8.9m shares were repurchased by 31 March 2017 for total consideration of 131.5m.
The programme was announced on 11 November 2016 and the group plan to continue this activity until December 2017.
The nominal value of share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of share capital and into the capital redemption reserve.
During the year, on behalf of the Company, the employee share trust purchased 0.8m shares for a total consideration of 12.6m 2016 0.8m shares, consideration of 11.1m.
At 31 March 2017, the trust held 2.9m shares 2016 3.0m which had a market value of 42.5m 2016 45.5m.
22.2 Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve comprises the value of shares redeemed or purchased by the Company from distributable profits.
22.3 Hedge reserve The hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedge derivative instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
22.4 Translation reserve Comprises exchange translation differences on foreign currency net investments offset by exchange translation differences on borrowings and derivatives classified as net investment hedges under IAS 39.

Interest will accrue on any deferred coupon.
Retirement benefit obligations Defined benefit schemes The Group has two funded final salary pension schemes which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years.
The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.
The Company operates one of these schemes, being the Scottish Hydro-Electric scheme.
The Group also has an Employer Financed Retirement Benefit scheme and a Group Personal Pension Plan.
The Group Personal Pension Plan operates on a Money purchase basis and has been arranged with Friends Provident.
The Group matches employee contributions up to a specified limit, in most circumstances this is set at 6%.
The Group may also provide additional contributions of 3% after five years and a further 3% after ten years continuous Group service.

The next funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2018.
The Group has also set out an agreed schedule of contributions in respect of current accrual.
Based on this schedule of contributions, total contributions of approximately 33.1m are expected to be paid by the Company during the year ending on 31 March 2018, included within the amounts are deficit repair contributions of 14m, the Company has agreed to pay this amount annually until March 2019.
Southern Electric Pension Scheme The last actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2016 and showed a deficit of 417.1m.
The Group is paying deficit contributions which, along with investment returns from return-seeking assets, is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2028.
The next funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2019.
The Company also pays contributions in respect of current accrual, with some active members also paying contributions.
Total contributions of approximately 70.6m are expected to be paid by the Company during the year ending on 31 March 2018, these include deficit repair contributions of 43.2m, which will be made annually until March 2020.
23.1 Pension scheme assumptions Both schemes have been updated to 31 March 2017 by qualified independent actuaries.
The valuations have been prepared for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19.

Retirement benefit obligations continued 23.4 Movements in the defined benefit asset obligations and assets during the year continued Staff costs analysis The pension costs in Note 8 can be analysed thus: 2017 2016 m m Service costs 64.5 66.1 Defined contribution scheme payments 55.9 56.3 120.4 122.4 23.5 Pension scheme risk assessment and mitigation Risks to which the pension schemes exposes the group The nature of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the schemes in times of adverse experience.
The most financially significant risks are likely to be: i Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The schemes hold a significant proportion of growth assets equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long-term objectives.
ii Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes.
However, this will be partially offset by and increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
iii Inflation risk The majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
iv Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so an increase in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication of the impact on the value of the schemes liabilities of the risks highlighted.
v Liability vs asset risk The risk that movement in the value of the schemes liabilities are not met by corresponding movements in the value of the schemes assets.
Risk Mitigation fide-risking The trustees have taken a number of steps to control the level of investment risk including reducing the schemes exposures to higher risk assets and increasing the level of protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation.
The trustees of both schemes continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the respective schemes.
Asset-liability matching strategies used by the scheme The Company and trustees of the schemes have agreed a long-term investment strategy that seeks to reduce investment risk as and when appropriate.
The asset-liability matching strategy is part of this approach which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension schemes by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the schemes so as to protect against inflation being higher than expected.
This has been adopted for a proportion of the schemes assets, which is designed to provide partial protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation.
The trustees of the respective schemes review the schemes asset allocation on an ongoing basis in light of changes in the funding position and market opportunities.

ii Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses The sensitivities disclosed are calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the schemes liabilities.
While these have been calculated consistently with the previous financial year, the method applied may change over time with financial conditions andassumptions.
iii Asset recognition The Group has recognised net pension assets in relation to the Scottish Hydro Electric pension scheme due to a surplus existing under IAS 19 accounting.
The Group will only recognise a surplus should it have rights to that surplus under the rules of the pension scheme.
During the financial year the company has no longer applied the asset ceiling restriction mandated by IFRIC 14 in respect of the Scottish Hydro Pension scheme.
Details on this key accounting consideration are provided at Note 4.2 v and above.
iv Fair value assessment of scheme assets The Group seeks to assess whether there is a quotable market value referenced as quotable above in relation to pension scheme assets held.
This assessment is based on regular reviews conducted in conjunction with the trustees of the schemes.
For assets where no quotable market value exists, these assets will be valued based on a set methodology agreed by trustees and scheme advisors and then regularly assessed.
Currently only one unquotable value exists within the two pension schemes of the Group, this being insurance contracts held by the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme which were entered into during the current financial year.
These assets are currently valued consistently with the schemes liabilities with the expected return on these assets being set equal to the discount rate.
Financial instruments For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into two categories, operating derivatives and financing derivatives.
Operating derivatives include all qualifying commodity contracts including those for electricity, gas, oil, coal and carbon.
Financing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted mark-to-market interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts.
Non-hedge accounted contracts are treated as held for trading.

Certain obligations under power purchase agreements with various power generating companies are not deemed to qualify as finance leases as the lease term is not judged to be substantially all of the economic life of the power station and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the agreements did not amount to substantially all of the fair value of the power stations at that time.
ii Leases as lessor: The Group have no operating lease commitments as a lessor.
