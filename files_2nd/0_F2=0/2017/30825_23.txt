Herald Investment Trust plc Annual report & financial statements 2017 54 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements for the year to 31 December 2017 have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out below.
The Company has applied FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland FRS102, which forms part of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
A ACCOUNTING CONVENTION The financial statements are prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be retained.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency and the currency in which the Companys share capital and expenses, as well the majority of its assets and liabilities, are denominated.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with The Companies Act 2006, FRS102 and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in November 2014 as amended in January 2017.
In order to better reflect the activities of the Company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the profit and loss account between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented in the income statement.
B FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Company will offset financial assets and financial liabilities if the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and interests and intends to settle on a net basis.
C INVESTMENTS Purchases and sales of investments are accounted for on a trade date basis.
All investments are at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
The fair value of listed security investments is bid value.
Investments on the Alternative Investment Market are included at their bid value.
The fair value of unlisted investments uses valuation techniques determined by the directors on the basis of latest information in line with the relevant principles of the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the unrealised fair value and on the sale of investments are taken to capital reserve through the income statement.
D CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash as well as cash equivalents including short term deposits and money market funds which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Investments are regarded as cash equivalents if they meet all of the following criteria: highly liquid investments held in the Companys base currency that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and provide a return no greater than the rate of a three-month high quality government bond.
E INCOME Dividend income is accounted for when the entitlement to the income is established normally on the ex-dividend date.
Franked income is stated net of tax credits.
Unfranked investment income includes the taxes deducted at source.
Interest from fixed interest securities is recognised on an effective yield basis.
Underwriting commission and interest receivable on deposits are recognised on an accruals basis.
Foreign dividends that suffer withholding tax at source are shown gross, with the corresponding tax charge in the income statement.
F EXPENSES All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged through the revenue column of the income statement except where they relate directly to the acquisition or disposal of an investment transaction costs and are taken to the income statement as a capital item.
G FINANCE COSTS Finance costs are accounted for on an effective interest basis and are charged through the revenue column of the income statement.
H DERIVATIVES Until 29 July 2016, the Company used interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flow risk arising from interest rate fluctuations.
The swap was marked to fair value.
The fair value was estimated based on the swap providers valuation and was compared to an external model and external prices.
Gains or losses arising on the fair value of the interest rate swap during the year were taken to the income statement as a capital item.
In accordance with FRS102 section 12: Financial Instruments: Measurement, derivative instruments are valued at fair value and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Herald Investment Trust plc Annual report & financial statements 2017 55 I DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, calculated on an undiscounted basis, and based on enacted tax rates relevant to the benefit or liability.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which underlying timing differences can be deducted.
J FOREIGN CURRENCY Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences of a revenue or capital nature are taken to the revenue or capital reserves respectively through the income statement.
K USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.
The judgements relate to the investments where there is no appropriate market price i. e. the unquoted investments and before it was closed off on 29 July 2016 the interest rate swap.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, GUARANTEES AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS There were no contingent liabilities, guarantees or financial commitments at 31 December 2017.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
The capital of the Company is the ordinary share capital and reserves as detailed in notes 13 and 14.
It is managed in accordance with its investment policy in pursuit of its investment objective, both of which are detailed on page 2, and shares may be repurchased as explained on page 36.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In accordance with the corporate objective of maximising capital appreciation the Company invests in securities on a worldwide basis.
The Company makes use of gearing to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The Companys other financial instruments consist of cash, short term debtors and creditors.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are: A.
MARKET RISK i Other price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movement: ii Interest rate risk, being the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: and iii Foreign currency risk, being the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
CREDIT RISK Being the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge anobligation.
The Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk from the parties with which it trades and will bear the risk of settlement default.
Counterparty credit risk to the Company arises from transactions to purchase or sell investments held within theportfolio.
There were no past due nor impaired assets as of 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 nil.
The counterparties engaged with the Company are well recognised and regulated entities.
Herald Investment Trust plc Annual report & financial statements 2017 61 C. LIQUIDITY RISK Being the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
These risks and the policies for managing them have been applied throughout the year and are summarised below.
Further detail is contained in the strategic report on page 31.
MARKET RISK i Other Price Risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the manager in pursuance of the corporate objective.
Listed securities held by the Company are valued at bid prices, whereas material unlisted investments are valued using valuation techniques selected by the directors on the basis of the latest information in line with the relevant principles of the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines Accounting Policy 1 c. These valuations also represent the fair value of the investments, see note 9 on pages 57 and 58.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 20 to 25.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a review of the 20 largest equity investments by their aggregate market value, are shown on pages 7 and 15 to 19.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity 16.7% of the Companys equity investments at 31 December 2017 2016 20.6% were listed on the main list of the London Stock Exchange and a further 47.8% 2016 42.2% on AIM.
The NASDAQ Stock Exchange accounts for 20.9% 2016 19.3%, New York Stock Exchange for 3.2% 2016 5.0% and other stock exchanges 11.4% 2016 12.9%.
A 10% increase in equity investment prices at 31 December 2017 would have increased total net assets and profit & loss after taxation by 89,610,000 2016 70,493,000.
A decrease of 10% would have the exact opposite effect.
The portfolio does not target any exchange as a comparative index, and the performance of the portfolio has a low correlation to generally used indices.
ii Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Companys assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
However, the Company does hold convertible bonds and Government bonds, the interest rate and maturity dates of which are detailed below.
Interest is accrued on cash balances at a rate linked to the UK Bank of England base rate.
At 31 December 2017, the Company had an undrawn 25 million multi-currency credit facility 2016 multi currency loan: nil: sterling loan: 25 million.
The aim of the use of gearing is to enhance long term returns to shareholders by investing borrowed funds in equities and other assets.
How and where borrowings are invested is reviewed by the board in consultation with the manager at every board meeting.
In light of the decisions made, appropriate adjustments to the gearing position are then made by the manager.
The interest rate risk profile of the financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December was: FINANCIAL ASSETS 2017 2016 Weighted Weighted 2017 average 2016 average Weighted period Weighted period average until average until 2017 interest maturity 2016 interest maturity Fair value rate interest maturity Fair value rate interest maturity 000 rate date 000 rate date Fixed rate: US bonds 29,445 1.0% 0.8 Years 8,041 2.6% 2.3 Years UK convertible bonds 3,238 9.8% 3.4 Years 2,782 11.2% 1.6 Years Cash: Other overseas currencies 26,363 0.2% 52,675 0.0% Sterling 15,507 0.0% 29,773 0.3% 41,870 82,448 The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the Bank of England base rate.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 2017 2017 2016 2016 Net Loan Net Loan 2017 interest facility 2016 interest facility 000 rate paid expired 000 rate paid expires Bank Loan 25,000 1.6% Dec 2017 Total 25,000 1.6% At 31 December 2017, the Company had a committed revolving multi currency credit facility of 25 million 2016 multi-currency 25 million and sterling 25 million, maturing on 31 December 2019 with a cost associated rate of 0.63% 2016 0.63% for unutilised amounts.
The effective fixed rate of interest on the sterling loan for the period 1 January to 29 December 2017 was 1.5% 20161.5%.
Interest rate risk sensitivity a Cash An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates as at 31 December 2017 would have a direct effect on net assets.
Based on the position at 31 December 2017, over a full year, an increase of 100 basis points would have increased the profit & loss after taxation by 419,000 2016 824,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share by 0.60p 2016 1.13p.
The calculations are based on the cash balances as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
b Fixed rate bonds An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 December 2017 would have decreased total net assets and profit & lossafter taxation by 294,000 2016 80,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 0.42p 2016 0.11p.
A decrease in bond yields would have had an equal and opposite effect.
The convertible loan stocks having an element of equity are not included in this analysis as given the nature of the businesses and the risk profile of the balance sheets they are considered to have more equity like characteristics.
c Bank loans At 31 December 2017, the Company had no loan drawn down 2016 an increase of 100 basis points in 3 month LIBOR interest rates as at 31 December 2016 on the interest cost of the bank loans would have decreased total net assets and profit & loss after taxation by 250,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 0.34p.
A decrease of 100 basis points in 3 month LIBOR interest rates would have the exact opposite effect.
iii Foreign Currency Risk The Companys reporting currency is sterling, but investments are made in overseas markets as well as the United Kingdom and the asset value can be affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
Furthermore many companies trade internationally both through foreign subsidiaries, and through exports.
The greatest foreign currency risk occurs when companies have a divergence in currencies for costs and revenues.
A much less risky exposure to currency is straight translation of sales and profits.
The list of investments on pages 20 to 25 breaks down the portfolio by geographic listing.
However the location of the stock market quote only has a limited correlation to the costs, revenues and even activities of those companies, and so this note should not be regarded as a reliable guide to the sensitivity of the portfolio to currency movements.
For example, the holdings in the portfolio that have suffered most from US$ weakness are UK companies with dollar revenues and sterling costs.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
Overseas income is subject to currency fluctuations.
The Company does not hedge these currency fluctuations because it is impossible to quantify the effect for the reasons stated above.
However, from time to time the manager takes a view by holding financial assets or liabilities in overseas currencies.

A 10% 2016 10% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had the exact opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
However, companies whose cost base diverges in currency terms from its sales will in the longer term have a significantly greater effect on valuation than simple translation.
In the short term investee companies generally cover their currency exposure to varying degrees.
There is insufficient publicly disclosed information to quantify this, but in the long term this effect is expected to dwarf simple translation of foreign listings in terms of both risk and reward, because many investee companies trade globally.
Furthermore, the country of listing is not necessarily an indication of the geography of some or even any operational activities for investee companies.
The manager does not use financial instruments to protect against currency movements.
From time to time financial leverage has been made using debt in overseas currencies.

CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment which it has entered into with the Company.
The manager monitors counterparty risk on an ongoing basis.
The Company has investments in convertible loan stocks that have an element of equity.
These securities are viewed as having a risk profile similar to the equity holdings.
This is because the convertibles held are in nascent technology companies that may be loss making and may have weak balance sheets.
For this reason these stocks are categorised as equity holdings and for risk management purposes excluded from the credit risk analysis.
Credit Risk Exposure The exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: 2017 2016 000 000 Fixed interest investments 29,445 8,041 Cash and cash equivalents 41,870 82,448 Other receivables 1,682 23,529 72,997 114,018 During the year the maximum exposure in fixed interest investments was 30,825,000 2016 8,041,000 and the minimum 7,520,000 2016 nil.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
C. LIQUIDITY RISK The Companys policy with regard to liquidity is to provide a degree of flexibility so that the portfolio can be repositioned when appropriate and that most of the assets can be realised without an excessive discount to the market price.
Equity Securities The Companys unlisted investments are not readily realisable, but these only amount to 1.3% of the Companys total assets at 31 December 2017 2016 1.4%.
In practice, liquidity in investee companies is imperfect, particularly those with a market value of less than 100 million.
To reduce this liquidity risk it is the policy to diversify the holdings and generally to restrict the holding in any one company to less than 10% of the share capital of that company.
Furthermore the guideline is for no single investment to account for more than 5% of the assets of the Company.
The market valuation of each underlying security gives an indication of value, but the price at which an investment can be made or realised can diverge materially from the bid or offer price depending on market conditions generally and particularly to each investment.
20.1% 178 million 2016 22.8% 158 million of the portfolio is invested in listed stocks with a market capitalisation below 100 million, where liquidity is expected to be more limited.
If these stocks had on average a realisable value 20% below the bid price the value of the total fund would be adversely affected by 3.7% 2016 4.0%.
Liquidity Risk Exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2017 2016 One year One year or less or less 000 000 Bank loans 25,101 Other payables 2,443 2,532 2,443 27,633 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys investments, as disclosed in the Companys balance sheet, are valued at fair value.
Nearly all of the Companys portfolio of investments are disclosed in the Level 1 category as defined in FRS102.
Categorisation is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety.
The three levels set out in FRS102 follow: Level 1 The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Herald Investment Trust plc Annual report & financial statements 2017 65 Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable i. e. developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Inputs are unobservable i. e. for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability.
The investment manager considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
