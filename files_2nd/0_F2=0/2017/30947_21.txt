f Currency translation The functional currency of the Company is the US dollar and is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are initially recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions which are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities which are translated at period-end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
g Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
If, in subsequent periods, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
h Dividends receivable Dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payments is established.
Dividends received are recorded in the income statement.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Hochschild Mining plc 145 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information i Other receivables Current receivables are carried at the original amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this difference is recognised in the income statement.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost.
For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash within three months or less and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
k Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Any excess above the par value of shares received upon issuance of those shares is classified as share premium.
In the case the excess above par value is available for distribution, it is classified as merger reserve and then transferred to retained earnings.
l Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
m Share-based payments Cash-settled transactions The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards.
Movements in that liability between reporting dates are recognised as personnel expenses.
The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted by a factor for anticipated relative TSR performance.
Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that vest.
The income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in personnel expenses.
n Finance income and costs Finance income and costs mainly comprise interest income on funds invested, interest expense on borrowings, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments.
Interest income and costs are recognised as they accrue, taking into account the effective yield on the asset and liability, respectively.
o Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes with the following exemptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 146 Hochschild Mining plc Notes to the parent company financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued p Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as loans or borrowings, receivables, payables, financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss or as available-for sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it.
The embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract.
Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Financial guarantees Financial guarantees are guarantees provided by the Company on behalf of one of the Groups subsidiaries.
At inception the fair value of a financial guarantee is determined and recognised as a liability in the Companys accounts, while the debit is recognised as a capital contribution to its subsidiary.
The liability is subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee, unless it is considered probable that the guarantee will be called, in which case it is measured at the value of the guaranteed amount payable, if higher.
The liability is presented within creditors as Financial liability financial guarantee.
Loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.
A detailed description of the Companys policies in respect of financial instruments is included in the Groups financial statements note 2 t. q Dividends distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
3 Profit and loss account The Company made a profit attributable to equity shareholders of US$487,315,000 2016: US$1,199,842,000.

As a result of this test, the Company recognised an impairment reversal of the investment in Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd. of US$491,285,000 2016: US$1,202,604,000.
The recoverable value of the investment in Hochschild Mining Holdings Limited was determined using a fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value less costs of disposal was determined with reference to the market capitalisation of the Group at 31 December 2017 and 2016 translated from Pounds Sterling into US dollars using the year-end exchange rate both Level 1 inputs, to which a control premium was added based on recent market transactions a Level 2 input, and subsequently adjusted for the net debt held directly by the Company.
A Level 1 input refers to quoted prices in active markets, while a Level 2 input corresponds to other information that can be observed directly or indirectly.
Any positive variation in the key assumptions would not have an impact on the impairment reversal recognised.
Therefore, an adverse change of 10% of the market capitalisation would result in a reduction of the reversal of impairment by US$86,048,000.
The breakdown of the investments in subsidiaries is as follows: As at 31 December 2017 As at 31 December 2016 Country of Equity interest Carrying value Country of Equity interest Carrying value Name incorporation % US$000 incorporation % US$000 Hochschild Mining Holdings Limited England & Wales 100% 2,336,010 England & Wales 100% 1,844,725 Total 2,336,010 1,844,725 The list of indirectly held subsidiaries of the Group is presented in note 1 Corporate information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

a Foreign currency risk Due to the operations of the Company, it has cash and cash equivalents and trade payables denominated in Pounds Sterling and Canadian dollars.
Accordingly, the financial results of the Company may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company has evaluated and introduced efforts to try to mitigate credit risk exposure.
To manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the Company is: increasing banking relationships with large, established and well-capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk: investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments term deposits : and maintaining excess cash abroad in hard currency.
Credit risk concentrations exist when changes in economic, industrial or geographic factors take place, affecting in the same manner the Companys counterparties whose added risk exposure is significant to the Companys total credit exposure.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Companys exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 6. c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Companys inability to obtain the funds it requires to comply with its commitments, including the inability to sell a financial asset quickly enough and at a price close to its fair value.
Management constantly monitors the Companys level of shortand medium-term liquidity and their access to credit lines on reasonable terms in order to ensure appropriate financing is available for its operations.
The Company is funded by Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd through loans in order to meet its obligations.
Liquidity is supported by the balance of cash and cash equivalent held by the Company and Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd at 31 December 2017 of US$2,182,000 2016: US$10,402,000 and US$16,137,000 2016: US$17,218,000 respectively.

d Capital risk management The Companys objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Companys ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Management considers as part of its capital the financial sources of funding from shareholders and third parties notes 8 and 9.
