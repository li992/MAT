Other debt securities of 10,801 million 2016: 12,224 million include residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, as well as other structured credit securities.
Following a review of the Groups investment classifications, comparative amounts have been amended from those previously reported, reflecting the fact that equity and debt securities held indirectly through majority owned investment funds in the UK managed by third parties, which in 2016 were presented as unit trusts and other investment vehicles within other investments, are now presented as debt and equity securities.
The effect of this change is to increase equity and debt securities by 3,434 million and 3,694 million and decrease unit trusts and other investment vehicles within other investments by 7,128 million.
In addition, assets classified as held for sale of 10,706 million have been revised from available for sale to other than trading.
