Management tax rate The tax charge arising on management profit before tax less the share of post tax earnings of EAI of 492 million 2016: 605 million was 110 million 2016: 144 million giving an effective tax rate of 22% 2016: 24%.
Judgements and estimates The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude.
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions of 121 million which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historical tax positions.
Management uses in-house tax experts, professional advisers and previous experience when assessing tax risks.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions.
As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments which have a material impact on the Groups tax rate and or cash tax payments may arise.
Tax payments comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Where companies utilise brought forward tax losses such that little or no tax is paid, this also results in differences between the tax charge and cash tax payments.
With regard to deferred tax, judgement is required for the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is based on expectations of future financial performance in particular legal entities or tax groups.

Other changes in deferred tax assets relate to an increase in unrecognised tax losses where it is not considered probable the losses will expire before they are utilised.
The rate change primarily relates to the change of rate in the US discussed below.

These territories have both recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where, based on management projections, the future availability of taxable profits to absorb the deductions before any applicable time limits expire is probable.
Deferred tax assets including tax losses are not recognised where the Groups ability to utilise them is not probable, for example where management projections indicate there will be insufficient future profits before losses expire, or in cases where the quantum of losses is uncertain i. e. subject to cases such as the FII GLO.
Other deferred tax arises mainly in relation to items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period than the income or expense is accrued in the financial statements.
Other deferred tax assets include 46 million relating to derivatives 2016: 139 million.
e Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets that have not been recognised are shown below.
2017 2016 Tax value Gross Expiry Tax value Gross Expiry m m period m m period Tax losses with expiry: national 146 584 2018-2027 120 474 2017-2026 Tax losses with expiry: local 10 341 2018-2037 8 277 2017-2036 Tax losses without expiry 53 262 50 258 Total tax losses 209 1,187 178 1,009 Other temporary differences 7 28 15 46 Unrecognised deferred tax assets 216 1,215 193 1,055 No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where the distribution of such profits is planned.
If these earnings were remitted in full, tax of 49 million 2016: 41 million would be payable.
f Changes in UK tax rate The effective tax rate for the year was 19.25% following a reduction to the rate on 1 April 2017.
A further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020 has been substantively enacted.
UK temporary differences are measured at the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
New legislation became effective in April 2017 which will restrict the use of brought forward losses in the UK.
This legislation was substantively enacted on 16 November 2017.
It is anticipated this will not affect the ability to use recognised deferred tax assets but may affect the period over which the losses can be utilised.
g Changes in US tax rate On 22 December 2017, US tax legislation Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law and was therefore substantively enacted for IFRS purposes.
The law is wide ranging and includes a number of significant changes.
The immediate impact for the Group is the reduction in the main rate of corporate tax from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018.
This has resulted in a reduction in the overall deferred tax assets and liabilities in the US, resulting in a charge to other comprehensive income in respect of pension-related deferred tax assets and derivative financial instruments and a credit to income statement in relation to other deferred tax liabilities.
h Franked investment income litigation Since 2003, the Group has been involved in litigation with HMRC in respect of various advance corporate tax payments and corporate tax paid on certain foreign dividends which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of the Groups EU community law rights.
The most recent Court of Appeal judgment in the case was published in November 2016.
This judgment was broadly positive but HMRC have sought leave to appeal.
The continuing complexity of the remaining case and uncertainty over the issues raised and in particular which points HMRC may seek to appeal means that it is not possible to predict the final outcome of the litigation with any reasonable degree of certainty.
A successful outcome could result in the Group being able to recognise additional deferred tax assets in the UK and receiving cash payments from HMRC.
GKN has previously received payments from HMRC in respect of the case, principally interest, which have been recognised as received.
In 2017, the Group agreed a settlement of 4 million with HMRC, which resulted in a gross interest receipt of 4 million and 2 million of restitutional and other charges.
