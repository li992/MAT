The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which could impact the Group, with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below: Accounting standard Effective date IAS 7 amendments Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2017 subject to EU endorsement IAS 12 amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for 1 January 2017 subject to EU endorsement Unrealised Losses IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 2 amendments Classification and Measurement of Share-based 1 January 2018 subject to EU endorsement Payment Transactions The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
Beyond this, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Accounting standard Effective date IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 subject to EU endorsement The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset is of low value.
The above standard reflects a significant change in the accounting and reporting of leases for lessees as it provides a single lessee accounting model, and as such, requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less.
Accounting requirements for lessors is substantially unchanged from IAS 17.
As shown in note 2.3, the Group has lease commitments of 693m at 30 September 2017 across more than 300 leases of varying remaining length and age.
The impact of the standard on the Group is currently being assessed and it is not yet practicable to quantify the effect of IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements.
There is no impact on cash flow.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Estimates and judgements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Details of the Groups critical accounting judgements and estimates are described within the relevant accounting policy section in each of the notes to the financial statements.
Critical judgements are described in each section listed below: Note 2.2 Separately disclosed items Note 3.1 Property, plant and equipment Note 3.3 Provisions Note 4.5 Pensions Critical estimates are described in: Note 3.1 Property, plant and equipment Annual report and accounts 2017 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | 103 Notes to the financial statements Section 2 Results for the year 2.1 Segmental analysis Accounting policies Operating segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be based on the Groups internal reporting to its Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM is regarded as the Chief Executive together with other Board members.
The CODM uses EBITDA and profit before interest and adjusted items operating profit pre-adjustments as the key measures of the segment results.
Group assets are reviewed as part of this process but are not presented on a segment basis.
The retail operating business operates all of the Groups retail operating units and generates all of its external revenue.
The property business holds the Groups freehold and long leasehold property portfolio and derives all of its income from the internal rent levied against the Groups retail operating units.
At a macro level, rent is set on a market-based measure with this being reviewed on a five yearly basis.
The internal rent charge is eliminated at the total Group level.

This adjusted information is disclosed to allow a better understanding of the adjusted trading performance of the Group and is consistent with the Groups internal management reporting.
Separately disclosed items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence and include movements in the valuation of the property portfolio as a result of the annual revaluation exercise, impairment review of short leasehold and unlicensed properties, movements in the onerous lease provision, restructuring costs and effects of corporation tax rate change.
Critical accounting judgements Judgement is used to determine those items which should be separately disclosed to allow a better understanding of the adjusted trading performance of the Group.
This judgement includes assessment of whether an item is of sufficient size or of a nature that is not consistent with normal trading activities.
Separately disclosed items are identified as follows: Profit loss arising on property disposals property disposals are disclosed separately as they are not considered to be part of adjusted trade performance and there is volatility in the size of the profit loss in each accounting period.
Movement in the valuation of the property portfolio this is disclosed separately, due to the size of the movement in property valuation each period.
This movement is also not considered to be part of the adjusted trade performance of the Group.
Onerous lease provision this provision is calculated on a site by site basis, with the majority of the additions for the current period being disclosed separately.
This increase is the result of a full review of estate strategy.
In addition, the discount rate applied in calculating the provision has been changed in the current period.
Due to the size of the resulting increase in the provision, this has been disclosed separately.
Tax rate change the change in tax rate is not part of normal trade and due to the size in any given period, this is disclosed separately.
The items identified in the current period are as follows: 2017 2016 53 weeks 52 weeks Notes m m Adjusted items Net profit arising on property disposals 1 1 Movement in the valuation of the property portfolio see note 3.1 : Impairment arising from the revaluation a 51 80 Impairment of short leasehold and unlicensed properties b 17 8 Impairment of assets held for sale c 4 Net movement in the valuation of the property portfolio 72 88 Other adjusted items: Onerous lease provision additions d 35 Total adjusted items before tax 106 87 Tax credit relating to above items 23 18 Tax credit in respect of change in tax legislation note 2.4 e 14 Total adjusted items after tax 83 55 a.

c. Impairment recognised on reclassification of property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale.
d. During the period, a review of estate strategy in relation to managed leasehold sites has been completed, with specific focus on the challenges around loss-making sites and those located on retail and leisure parks.
The losses are now considered unavoidable for the remaining committed lease term.
In addition, the discount rate applied in the calculation has been updated.
As a result, the onerous lease provision has been increased significantly with the majority of this increase recognised as a separately disclosed item.
See note 3.3 for further details.
e. The prior year deferred tax credit relates to the enactment of the Finance No.
2 Act 2015 on 18 November 2015 which reduced the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017.

Such premiums are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current prepayments, with the current portion being the element which relates to the following period.

Annual report and accounts 2017 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | 107 Notes to the financial statements Section 2 Results for the year continued 2.4 Taxation Accounting policies The income tax expense represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the period, and deferred tax and is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are not taxable.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items that are charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the income tax is also charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount of their tax bases.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.

Annual report and accounts 2017 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | 109 Notes to the financial statements Section 2 Results for the year continued 2.4 Taxation continued Unrecognised tax allowances At the balance sheet date the Group had unused tax allowances of 80m in respect of unclaimed capital allowances 2016 66m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on tax allowances with a value of 14m 2016 11m because it is not certain that future taxable profits will be available in the company where these tax allowances arose against which the Group can utilise these benefits.
These tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
Factors which may affect future tax charges The Finance No.
2 Act 2015 was enacted on 18 November 2015 and reduced the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017.
The Finance Act 2016 was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016 and reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020.
The effect of these changes has been reflected in the closing deferred tax balances at 24 September 2016 and 30 September 2017.
2.5 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before adjusted items see note 2.2 in order to allow a better understanding of the adjusted trading performance of the Group.

Short leasehold buildings leases with an unexpired lease term of less than 50 years, unlicensed land and buildings and fixtures, fittings and equipment are held at cost less depreciation and impairment.
All land and buildings are disclosed as a single class of asset within the property, plant and equipment table, as we do not consider the short leasehold and unlicensed buildings to be material for separate disclosure.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell where this is lower.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost less residual value over the estimated useful life of an asset and commences when an asset is ready for its intended use.
Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year and adjusted if appropriate.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated so that the difference between their carrying value and estimated residual value is written off over 50 years from the date of acquisition.
The residual value of freehold and long leasehold buildings is reassessed each year and is estimated to be equal to the fair value determined in the annual valuation and therefore no depreciation charge is recognised.
Short leasehold buildings, and associated fixtures, fittings and equipment, are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the unexpired term of the lease.
Fixtures, fittings and equipment have the following estimated useful lives: Information technology equipment 3 to 7 years Fixtures and fittings 3 to 20 years At the point of transfer to non-current assets held for sale, depreciation ceases.
Should an asset be subsequently reclassified to property, plant and equipment, the depreciation charge is calculated to reflect the cumulative charge had the asset not been reclassified.
Disposals Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Revaluation The revaluation utilises valuation multiples, which are determined via third-party inspection of 20% of the sites such that all sites are individually valued approximately every five years: and estimates of fair maintainable trade FMT : and estimated resale value of tenants fixtures and fittings.
Properties are valued as fully operational entities, to include fixtures and fittings but excluding stock and personal goodwill.
The value of tenants fixtures and fittings is then removed from this valuation via reference to its associated resale value.
Where sites have been impacted by expansionary capital investment in the preceding 12 months, the prior year FMT is considered to represent the most appropriate maintainable profit of the site as the current year trading performance includes a period of closure.
Valuation multiples derived via third-party inspections determine brand standard multiples which are then used to value the remainder of the non-inspected estate via an extrapolation exercise, with the output of this exercise reviewed at a high level by the Directors and the thirdparty valuer.
Surpluses which arise from the revaluation exercise are included within other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve unless they are reversing a revaluation adjustment which has been recognised in the income statement previously: in which case an amount equal to a maximum of that recognised in the income statement previously is recognised in income.
Where the revaluation exercise gives rise to a deficit, this is reflected directly within the income statement, unless it is reversing a previous revaluation surplus against the same asset: in which case an amount equal to the maximum of the revaluation surplus is recognised within other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve.
Impairment Short leasehold and unlicensed properties are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an outlet exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an outlets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any changes in outlet earnings, or cash flows, the discount rate applied to those cash flows, or the estimate of sales proceeds could give rise to an additional impairment loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
An impairment reversal is only recognised where there is a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amounts, not where it results from the passage of time.
Annual report and accounts 2017 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | 111 Notes to the financial statements Section 3 Operating assets and liabilities continued 3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued Critical accounting judgements The revaluation methodology is determined using management judgement, with advice from third-party valuers.
The application of a valuation multiple to the fair maintainable trade of each site is considered the most appropriate method for the Group to determine the fair value of licensed land and buildings.
Where the value of land and buildings derived purely from a multiple applied to the fair maintainable trade misrepresents the underlying asset value, due to low levels of income or location characteristics, a spot valuation is applied.
Management also use judgement to determine the most appropriate method of reviewing short leasehold and unlicensed properties for impairment.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations by applying growth rates to determine future cash flows and discounting at an appropriate rate.
Critical accounting estimates The application of the valuation methodology requires two critical accounting estimates: the estimation of valuation multiples, which are determined via third-party inspections: and an estimate of fair maintainable trade, including reference to historic and future projected income levels.
A sensitivity analysis of changes in valuation multiples and FMT, in relation to the properties to which these estimates apply, is provided on page 113.
The carrying value of properties to which these estimates apply is 4,230m 2016 4,217m.

Revaluation of freehold and long leasehold properties The freehold and long leasehold properties have been valued at market value, as at 30 September 2017 using information provided by CBRE, independent chartered surveyors.
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the provisions of RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards The Red Book assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity.
The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of location, quality of the pub restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
Sensitivity analysis Changes in either the FMT or the multiple could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold properties.
It is estimated that, given the multiplier effect, a 2.5% change in the EBITDA of the freehold or long leasehold properties would generate an approximate 70m movement in their valuation.
It is estimated that a 0.1 change in the multiple would generate an approximate 31m movement in valuation.
Impairment review of short leasehold and unlicensed properties Short leasehold and unlicensed properties comprising land and buildings and fixtures, fittings and equipment which are not revalued to fair market value, are reviewed for impairment by comparing site value in use calculations to their carrying values.
The value in use calculation uses forecast trading performance cash flows, which are discounted by applying a pre-tax discount rate of 7% 2016 7%.
Any resulting impairment relates to sites with poor trading performance, where the output of the value in use calculation is insufficient to justify their current net book value.
Current year valuations have been incorporated into the financial statements and the resulting revaluation adjustments have been taken to the revaluation reserve or income statement as appropriate.
The impact of the revaluations impairments described above is as follows: 2017 2016 53 weeks 52 weeks m m Income statement Revaluation loss charged as an impairment 109 144 Reversal of past impairments 58 64 Total impairment arising from the revaluation 51 80 Impairment of short leasehold and unlicensed properties 17 8 Impairment of assets held for sale 4 72 88 Revaluation reserve Unrealised revaluation surplus 210 329 Reversal of past revaluation surplus 136 113 74 216 Net increase in property, plant and equipment 2 128 The valuation techniques are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 and use significant unobservable inputs such that the fair value measurement of each property within the portfolio has been classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

3.3 Provisions Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured using the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Onerous property provisions represent the expected unavoidable losses on onerous and vacant property leases and comprise the lower of the net rent payable or the operating loss after rental costs.
The provision is calculated on a site by site basis with a provision being made for the remaining lease term, where a lease is considered to be onerous.
Other contractual dilapidations costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Critical accounting judgements Determination of whether a loss is unavoidable requires areas of judgement such as consideration of potential future investment decisions, local conditions which may be impacting on current performance and the opportunity to surrender a lease back to the landlord.
Annual report and accounts 2017 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | 115 Notes to the financial statements Section 3 Operating assets and liabilities continued 3.3 Provisions continued Critical accounting estimates In relation to onerous property provisions, estimates are required in determining the future EBITDA performance of each site and the potential to exit leases earlier than the expiry date.
A sensitivity analysis of changes in these estimates is provided below.
The value of provisions to which these estimates apply is 42m 2016 9m.
Provisions The provision for unavoidable losses on onerous property leases has been set up to cover rental payments of vacant or loss-making properties.
Payments are expected to continue on these properties for periods of 1 to 19 years.
Provisions can be analysed as follows: Property leases m At 26 September 2015 10 Released in the period 2 Provided in the period 5 Unwinding of discount Utilised in the period 4 At 24 September 2016 9 a Released in the period 1 b Provided in the period 36 Unwinding of discount 1 Utilised in the period 3 At 30 September 2017 42 a.
Releases in the period primarily relate to property disposals.
This has been recognised within adjusted profit to reflect where the charge for these properties was originally recognised.
During the period, a full review of estate strategy in relation to managed leasehold properties has been completed, with specific focus on the challenges around loss-making sites and those located on retail and leisure parks.
With lower footfall on many of these parks and the continued uncertain economic outlook, alongside increased cost pressures such as living wage, business rates review, apprenticeship levy, sugar tax and food price inflation, a number of short leasehold sites are now challenged when striving to achieve a break-even profit performance.
As a result, the losses are now considered unavoidable for the remaining committed lease term for managed properties.
As a result of these changes, a 35m increase in the provision which has been included as a separately disclosed item see note 2.2.
The remaining increase of 1m is recognised within adjusted profit, as this represents unavoidable losses on unlicensed properties.
There is no change in approach for these sites from the prior period.
Sensitivity analysis Changes in the EBITDA performance of each site could impact on the value of the provision.
It is estimated that, a 10% decline in the EBITDA performance of the sites included in the provision would generate an additional provision of 2m.
It is also estimated that, should all leases with more than ten years remaining on the committed lease term be exited two years ahead of expiry, the provision would reduce by 3m.
3.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policies Business combinations and goodwill Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised respectively: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
If, after reassessment, the net of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement as a bargain purchase.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the contingent consideration 116 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE 44 TO 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 transferred in a business combination.
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured at subsequent reporting dates, at fair value, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in the income statement.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity is re-measured to its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The impairment review requires management to consider the recoverable value of the business to which the goodwill relates, based on either the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use.
Value in use calculations require management to consider the net present value of future cash flows generated by the business to which the goodwill relates.
Fair value less costs to sell is based on managements estimate of the net proceeds which could be generated through disposing of that business.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Financial assets All financial assets are recognised or derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned.
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL : derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships: held-to-maturity investments: available-for-sale AFS financial assets: and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the instrument have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets, including redeemable notes classified as AFS, objective evidence of impairment could include: significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: or default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
120 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE 44 TO 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the agreed credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either borrowings at amortised cost or other financial liabilities.
The borrowings accounting policy is provided in note 4.2.
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but continues to control a transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability discharged and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.
Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the debt instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses interest rate and currency swap contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and hedge accounting is applied where the necessary criteria under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are met.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are re-measured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows at a rate that reflects the credit risk of various counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of highly probable future cash flows are recognised in equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Movements in the fair value of derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point, the cumulative gain or loss in equity remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Annual report and accounts 2017 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | 121 Notes to the financial statements Section 4 Capital structure and financing costs continued 4.4 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management Financial risk is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Groups Treasury function is governed by a Board Approved Treasury Policy Statement which details the key objectives and policies for the Groups treasury management.
The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board.
The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate.
The Group Treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is the only area of the business permitted to transact treasury deals.
It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies is set out below.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from funding and liquidity risk, credit risk, capital risk and market risk, principally as a result of changes in interest and currency rates.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage market risk.
Funding and liquidity risk In order to ensure that the Groups long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly assesses the maturity profile of the Groups debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections.
This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the Groups plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc and associated liquidity facility along with three committed unsecured revolving credit facilities of 50m each.
The terms of the securitisation and the revolving credit facilities contain various financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group Treasury.
The Group also has uncommitted revolving credit facilities of 15m.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period.
These forecasts are reviewed on a daily basis and are used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group.
A combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained.
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances or committed facilities outside the securitisation to ensure that it can meet its medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.
The maturity table below details the contractual undiscounted cash flows both principal and interest for the Groups financial liabilities, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.

Assumes no early redemption in respect of any loan notes.
Includes the impact of the cash flow hedges.
Credit risk The Group Treasury function enters into contracts with third parties in respect of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and the investment of surplus funds.
These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties.
To mitigate this exposure, Group Treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A long-term and A1 P1 F1 short-term.
Counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the Group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level.
The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is restricted under the policy.
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of counterparties.
The Group Treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, current exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis.
Any exceptions are required to be formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four-weekly basis.

Included in trade and other payables at the period end are amounts due to some of these suppliers.
This reduces the Groups credit exposure.
The Groups credit exposure at the balance sheet date was: 2017 2016 m m Cash and cash equivalents 147 158 Other cash deposits 120 120 Trade receivables 5 4 Other receivables 15 14 Derivatives 43 53 Capital management The Groups capital base is comprised of its net debt analysed in note 4.1 plus total equity disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet.
The objective is to maintain a capital base which is sufficiently strong to support the ongoing development of the business as a going concern, including the amenity, and cash flow generation of the pub estate.
By keeping debt see also Funding and liquidity risk above and headroom against its debt facilities at an appropriate level, the Group ensures that it maintains a strong credit position, whilst maximising value for shareholders and adhering to its covenants and other restrictions associated with its debt see note 4.2.
In managing its capital structure, from time to time the Group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, initiate and vary its dividend payments and seek to vary or accelerate debt repayments.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the maturity of its debt profile supports its strategic objectives.
The Board considers the latest covenant compliance, headroom projections and projected balance sheet positions periodically throughout the year, based on the advice of the Treasury Committee which meets on a four-weekly basis.
The Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Treasurer and monitors Treasury performance and compliance with Board-approved policies.
The Group Finance Director is also a member of the Committee.
Total capital at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Net debt note 4.1 1,750 1,840 Total equity 1,626 1,408 Total capital 3,376 3,248 Market risk The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises foreign currency and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk The Group faces currency risk in two main areas: At issuance of the Class A3N floating rate notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and initial interest elements of the notes.
The A3N notes form part of the securitised debt see note 4.2.
Further to the step-up on the A3N notes on 15 December 2010, the Group has additional foreign currency exposure as a result of the increase in US$ finance costs.
A movement of 10% in the US$ exchange rate would have nil 2016 nil impact on the reported Group profit and 22m 2016 25m impact on the reported Group net assets.
The Group has no significant profit and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.
As the Group is predominantly UK based and acquires the majority of its supplies in sterling, it has no significant direct currency exposure from its operations.
Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments.
Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39.
The interest rate exposure resulting from the Groups 1.9bn securitisation is largely fixed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at fixed interest rates, or through a combination of floating rate notes against which effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.
The sensitivity analysis below has been calculated based on the Groups exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments as at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, which are not hedged by derivative instruments, the analysis has been prepared assuming that the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole period.
For interest income the analysis assumes that cash and cash equivalents and other cash deposits that were held in interest bearing accounts at the balance sheet date were held for the whole period.
A 100 basis point movement is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

c. The impact on total equity from movements in the fair value of cash flow hedges.
Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedges Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash flow hedges detailed below have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a gain of 60m 2016 loss of 116m on cash flow hedges was recognised in equity.
A loss of 53m 2016 loss of 8m was recycled from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Cash flow hedges securitised borrowings At 30 September 2017, the Group held 10 2016 10 interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 963m 2016 994m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of 963m 2016 994m of the Groups floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows on these contracts occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8558% 2016 4.8625%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The 10 interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 292m 2016 404m.
At 30 September 2017 the Group held one 2016 one cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 177m 2016 189m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of the Groups A3N floating rate $297m 2016 $317m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value asset of 43m 2016 53m.
The cash flows on this contract occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a floating rate of interest at LIBOR in sterling.
The cash flows arising from interest rate swap positions on the same counterparty may be settled as a net position.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held under a separate agreement and cash movements for this instrument are settled individually.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments were measured at 30 September 2017 and may be subject to material movements in the period subsequent to the balance sheet date.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are reflected on the balance sheet as follows: Derivative financial instruments fair value Non-current Current Current Non-current assets assets liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m Cash flow hedges: Interest rate swaps 43 249 292 Cross currency swap 41 2 43 30 September 2017 41 2 43 249 249 24 September 2016 52 1 44 360 351 124 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE 44 TO 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 The fair value and carrying value of financial assets and liabilities by category is as follows: 2017 2016 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value m m m m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 147 147 158 158 Other cash deposits 120 120 120 120 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 43 43 53 53 Loans and receivables 20 20 18 18 Financial liabilities: Borrowings at amortised cost 2,062 2,076 2,173 2,167 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 292 292 404 404 Other 297 297 293 293 2,321 2,335 2,521 2,515 The various tranches of the securitised debt have been valued using period end quoted offer prices.
As the securitised debt is traded on an active market, the market value represents the fair value of this debt.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties which approximate to their fair market value and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or their book values approximate to fair values.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of the Groups derivative financial instruments is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows of each instrument at an appropriate discount rate to a mark to market position and then adjusting this to reflect any non-performance risk associated with the counterparties to the instrument.
IFRS 13 Financial Instruments requires the Groups derivative financial instruments to be disclosed at fair value and categorised in three levels according to the inputs used in the calculation of their fair value: Level 1 instruments use quoted prices as the input to fair value calculations: Level 2 instruments use inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly or indirectly: Level 3 instruments use inputs that are unobservable.

These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit section of the plans is now closed to future service accrual.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
In addition, Mitchells & Butlers plc also provides a workplace pension plan in line with the Workplace Pensions Reform Regulations.
This automatically enrols all eligible workers into a Qualifying Workplace Pension Plan.
The total pension liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the greater of the minimum funding requirements, calculated as the present value of the agreed schedule of contributions, and the actuarial calculated liability.
The actuarial liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based on a number of financial assumptions and estimates, the determination of which may be significant to the balance sheet valuation in the event that this reflects a greater deficit than that suggested by the schedule of minimum contributions.
There is no current service cost as all defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual.
The net pension finance charge, calculated by applying the discount rate to the pension deficit or surplus at the beginning of the period, is shown within finance income or expense.
The administration costs of the scheme are recognised within operating costs in the income statement.
Re-measurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of minimum funding requirements, and the return on scheme assets are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable for that period.
Critical accounting judgements The calculation of the defined benefit liability requires management judgement to select an appropriate high-quality corporate bond to determine the discount rate.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities Actuarial valuation The actuarial valuations used for IAS 19 revised purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2016 and updated by the schemes independent qualified actuaries to 30 September 2017.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 30 September 2017 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
IAS 19 revised requires that the scheme liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high-quality corporate bonds.
The principal financial assumptions used at the balance sheet date have been updated to reflect changes in market conditions in the period and are as follows: 2017 2016 Pensions increases 3.1% 2.9% Discount rate 2.7% 2.2% Inflation rate 3.2% 3.0% The mortality assumptions were reviewed following the 2016 actuarial valuation.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2017 2016 Executive Executive Main plan plan Main plan plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 21.2 23.8 21.7 25.9 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 22.9 25.5 24.3 27.6 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 23.6 25.9 24.1 27.1 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 25.4 27.8 26.9 29.1 126 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE 44 TO 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 Minimum funding requirements The results of the 2016 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit of 451m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 revised.
The Company has subsequently agreed recovery plans for both the Executive and Main schemes in order to close the funding deficit in respect of its pension liabilities.
Agreement was reached with the Trustees in relation to the Executive plan on 30 June 2017 and the Main plan on 25 July 2017.
In the intervening period, the Group continued to make contributions in line with the previous agreements.
The new recovery plans show an unchanged level of cash contributions with no extension to the agreed payment term 45m per annum indexed with RPI from 1 April 2016 subject to a minimum increase of 0% and maximum of 5%, until 31 March 2023.
Under IFRIC 14, an additional liability is recognised, such that the overall pension liability at the period end reflects the schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement, should this be higher than the actuarial deficit.
The employer contributions expected to be paid during the financial period ending 29 September 2018 amount to 47m.
In 2024, an additional payment of 13m will be made into escrow, should such further funding be required at that time.
This is a contingent liability and is not reflected in the pensions liability as it is not committed.
Sensitivity to changes in actuarial assumptions The sensitivities regarding principal actuarial assumptions, assessed in isolation, that have been used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Increase or decrease Increase or decrease in actuarial deficit in total pension liability 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m 0.1% increase in discount rate 41 52 1 2 0.1% points increase in inflation rate 36 49 1 2 Additional one-year increase to life expectancy 77 89 1 1 The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior periods.

This amount is included in other receivables in note 3.2.
4.6 Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures, on the number of shares that will eventually vest due to employees leaving the employment of the Group.
Fair values are calculated using either the Black-Scholes, Binomial or Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme.
This results in an accelerated recognition of the expense that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
Schemes in operation The net charge recognised for share-based payments in the period was 2m 2016 2m.
The Group had four equity-settled share schemes 2016 four in operation during the period: the Performance Restricted Share Plan PRSP : Sharesave Plan: Share Incentive Plan SIP and Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan STDIP.
There were no outstanding awards for the STDIP plan at the start of the period and no grants in the current period, therefore no disclosures are presented below for this scheme.
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during the vesting period.
Further details on each scheme are provided in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 66 to 87.
The following tables set out weighted average information about how the fair value of each option grant was calculated: 2017 2016 Performance Performance Restricted Sharesave Restricted Sharesave Share Plan Plan Share Plan Plan Valuation model Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo and Binomial Black-Scholes Binomial Black-Scholes Weighted average share price 246.1p 231.0p 239.5p 282.7p a Exercise price 221.0p 264.0p b Expected dividend yield 2.94% 2.32% Risk-free interest rate 0.34% 0.31% 0.11% 0.69% c Volatility 32.0% 29.43% 32.8% 28.3% d Expected life years 3.5 4.10 2.92 3.99 Weighted average fair value of grants during the period 182.4 42.8 159.3 57.8 a.
The exercise price for the Performance Restricted Share Plan is 1 per participating employee.
The expected dividend yield for the Sharesave Plan has used historical dividend information.
For details on the Groups current dividend policy refer to the Financial review on page 43.
The expected dividend yield for the Performance Restricted Share Plan options is zero as participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary dividends paid or payable during the vesting period.
c. The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
d. The expected life of the options represents the average length of time between grant date and exercise date.
The fair value of awards under the Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan and the Share Incentive Plan are equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary dividends paid or payable during the vesting period.
The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to these schemes.
The fair value of options granted under the Share Incentive Plan during the period was 231.0p 2016 282.7p.
