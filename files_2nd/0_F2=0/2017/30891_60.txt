For Upstream, goodwill is allocated to all oil and gas assets in aggregate at the segment level.
For Downstream, goodwill has been allocated to Lubricants and Other.

Upstream $ million 2017 2016 Goodwill 7,728 7,726 Excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount 27,705 26,035 Consistent with the prior year the review for impairment was carried out during the third quarter.
As permitted by IAS 36, the detailed calculations of recoverable amount performed in 2016 were used in the 2017 impairment test as the criteria in that standard were considered satisfied: the headroom was substantial in 2016: there have been no significant changes in the assets and liabilities: and the likelihood that the recoverable amount would be less than the carrying amount at the time was remote.
The table above shows the carrying amount of goodwill for the segment at year-end and the excess of the recoverable amount over the carrying amount at the date of the test the headroom.
The recoverable amount for 2017 is based upon the remaining future cash flows from the 2016 detailed calculation.
The headroom presented for 2017 does not represent the headroom that would result if a test was run based on discounted future cash flows estimated using updated 2017 data and assumptions.
The fair value less costs of disposal is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each producing field, appropriately risked for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment review of goodwill, because they are not part of the grouping of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates and which is used to monitor the goodwill for internal management purposes.
Where such activities form part of a wider Upstream cash-generating unit, they are reflected in the test.
The fair value calculation is based primarily on level 3 inputs as defined by the IFRS 13 Fair value measurement hierarchy.
As the production profile and related cash flows can be estimated from BPs experience, management believes that the estimated cash flows expected to be generated over the life of each field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill for impairment.
The estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by BP management.
Capital expenditure, operating costs and expected hydrocarbon production profiles are derived from the business segment plan.
Estimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis are developed to be consistent with this.
The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as part of BPs centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.
Exploration and appraisal assets are deemed to have a recoverable amount equal to their carrying amount.
The key assumptions used in the fair value less costs of disposal calculation are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate.
The price and discount rate assumptions for 2016 were used as disclosed in Note 1.
The fair value less costs of disposal calculations were prepared solely for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balance was impaired.
Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the basis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the prior year test.
The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made.
For example, reserves and resources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change, and future commodity prices may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.
