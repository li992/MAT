Financial Statements: Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 1.
Accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The amendments to FRS 101 2015 16 Cycle issued in June 2016 and effective immediately have been applied.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
1.2 Disclosure exemptions applied under FRS 101 The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: FRS 101.8 d : the requirement of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure to make disclosures about financial instruments FRS 101.8 e : the disclosure requirements of IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement FRS 101.8 f : the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in respect of: - paragraph 118 3 of IAS 38 Intangible Assets FRS 101.8 g : the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D and 111 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to produce a cash flow statement, a third balance sheet and to make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRSs FRS 101.8 h : the requirements of IAS 7 Statements of Cash Flows to produce a cash flow statement FRS 101.8 i : the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to include a list of new IFRSs that have been issued but that have yet to be applied FRS 101.8 k : the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to transaction is wholly owned by such a member The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
1.3 Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
In considering the appropriateness of this assumption, the Board have reviewed the Company's projections for the next twelve months and beyond, including cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.
1.4 Critical accounting judgements and estimates In applying the Groups accounting policies as described below management has primarily applied judgement in the impairment testing of the Companys investment in group undertakings.
Management has applied judgement in determining whether the carrying value of the investment, or asset may be supported by the recoverable amount calculation based on the value in use of the asset the net present value of future cash-flows arising from the asset.
In calculating the net present value of future cash-flows, management has made assumptions over the timing and amount of underlying profit projections of the relevant undertakings, long term growth rates in those projections and the discount rate applied to these projections that is appropriate to reflect the markets view of the risk of the relevant investment.
144 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Introduction Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 1.5 Shares in Group Undertakings Shares in Group undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
The requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Companys investments in subsidiaries.
When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal with its carrying amount.
Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment.
Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
1.6 Employee share schemes The Company operates a number of share schemes for its employees.
For equity settled schemes commencing 1 January 2004 and after, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the schemes is recognised as an increase in equity in the Company.
1.7 Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
1.8 Financial assets and liabilities All material investments held at fair value at the end of the period are invested in AAA-rated money market liquidity funds.
The measurement of these investments is based on active quoted market values level 1.
Government gilts are classified as AFS investments, in line with IAS 39 due to a reclassification in the period following the disposal of a portion of the holding.
Deposits held with credit institutions are classified as loans and receivables, in line with the nature of these deposits, with the 2016 comparative restated to reflect this more appropriate classification of these assets.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise subordinated notes which are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method and a credit facility held at amortised cost.
Administrative expenses Included within administrative expenses are re-charges of 1.6 million 2016: 1.4 million relating to employees within the Group who perform services on behalf of the Company.
No staff are directly employed by the Company.

Investments in Group undertakings m Investments in subsidiary undertakings: At 1 January 2016 293.5 Additions 14.8 At 31 December 2016 308.3 Additions 17.7 Impairment 25.0 At 31 December 2017 301.0 A full list of the Companys subsidiaries is disclosed in note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.
All investments in group undertakings are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13.
An annual impairment review is performed over the carrying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings, which involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell, and the value in use of the subsidiary, calculated using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management.
In 2017 a non-cash impairment loss of 25 million has been recognised by the Parent Company in respect of its investment in the Groups US insurance business Elephant Auto.
The impairment charge is presented within the Impairment losses line of the Parent Company Income Statement and reduces the value of the investment to its recoverable amount, being its value in use, of 100 million.
The impairment charge coincided with a review of the long-term strategy of Elephant by its management team and subsequent approval by the Board.
During 2017, additional capital of 16 million was provided to Elephant to continue to maintain a strong surplus over regulatory requirements.
Elephant remains loss making at this stage in its development, which is in line with its long-term plan.
Whilst the long-term plan did support the carrying value of the subsidiary, impairment was considered appropriate following the results of a number of stress tests applied to the plans.
The cash flows supporting the value in use are based on financial forecasts prepared for a 10 year period, this being justified by the historical accuracy of the forecasting process along with the strategy of long-term profitable growth.
Beyond the 10 year forecast period, a long-term growth rate of 2.5% has been used.
The key assumptions used in the underlying forecasts are those regarding acquisition and retention rates of customers, ancillary sales, loss and expense ratios.
The estimates are based on past practice and the experience of management, the long-term strategy as approved by the Board and reflect expected future changes in the market.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11% has been used, calculated using a Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM calculation using a risk free return plus an appropriate risk premium, given that an asset specific rate is not available from the market.
During 2017 the management team at Elephant has been strengthened and a number of important operational improvements have been made.
Although success is not certain, the Board remains confident in the prospects of the business and continues to support Elephant in the achievement of its goals.
The impairment charge has no impact on the Groups profit for the period or capital position.
