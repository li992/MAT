The expected rate is the weighted average rate taking into account the Groups profits in these jurisdictions.
The expected rate has increased in 2017 due to the change in mix of the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The tax charge for the year is higher 2016: higher than the expected tax credit charge due to the following factors: 2017 2016 $m $m Loss profit before taxation from continuing operations excluding profits from and impairment of joint ventures 24.9 119.3 Loss profit before tax at expected rate of 27.5% 2016: 24.7% 6.8 29.5 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior years 24.1 6.2 Non-recognition of losses and other attributes 9.4 10.0 Effect of foreign taxes 19.3 8.0 One-off impact of tax reform 13.0 - Other permanent differences 42.4 9.7 Total tax charge 8.4 31.6 The adjustment in respect of prior years is largely due to the release of uncertain tax provisions as the final outcome on certain issues was agreed during the year.
The one-off impact of tax reform is as a result of a reduction in the US tax rate from 1 January 2018 reducing the Groups deferred tax liability as well as changes in loss utilisation rules in the UK allowing losses that would not otherwise have been accessible to be utilised against future profits.
Other permanent differences include adjustments for share based charges, research and development allowances, changes in unrecognised tax attributes and expenditure which is not tax deductible.
Tax losses are recognised where there is reasonable certainty that they can be utilised in future years.
Other permanent differences in 2017 have been impacted by a restructure of Amec Foster Wheelers US business and the resulting tax charge on the related intercompany transactions although this has been partly offset by the utilisation of the businesses unrecognised tax losses.
Net income tax liabilities in the Group balance sheet include $265.2m relating to uncertain tax positions where management has had to exercise judgement in determining the most likely outcome in respect of the relevant issue.
The larger amounts relate to tax payable in relation to divestments $13.0m, recoverability of withholding taxes $81.6m, and group financing $51.4m.
Where the final outcome on these issues differs to the amounts provided, the Groups tax charge will be impacted.
Amounts are netted in the Group balance sheet where corporate tax assets and liabilities are in the same jurisdictions and to the extent there is a legal right of offset.

These options could potentially dilute earnings per share in future periods.
As adjusted diluted earnings per share is a non-GAAP measure, the potential ordinary shares have not been excluded from this calculation.
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to owners of the parent divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Groups employee share trusts.
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Groups dilutive ordinary shares comprise share options granted to employees under Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Retention Plan, shares and share options awarded under the Groups Long Term Plan and shares awarded under the Groups Employee Share Plan.
Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share are disclosed to show the results excluding the impact of exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets, goodwill was tested for impairment during the year.
The impairment tests were carried out by Cash Generating Unit CGU.
The Group has five reportable segments.
Goodwill is monitored by management at the level of these segments.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs as indicated in the table below.
94 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 8 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Value-in-use calculations have been prepared for each CGU using the cash flow projections included in the financial budgets and forecasts prepared by management and approved by the Board for 2018 and 2019.
The budgets and forecasts are based on various assumptions including market outlook, resource utilisation, contract backlog, contract margins and assumed contract awards.
Growth rates of between 5% and 9% per annum have been assumed for 2020 and for 2021 and 2022 cash flows have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% for Asset Solutions EAAA, Specialist Technical Solutions and Investment Services and 2% for Asset Solutions Americas and Environment and Infrastructure Solutions.
A terminal value is applied thereafter in order to calculate long term estimated cash flows using the same anticipated growth rates.
The growth rates used do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows have been discounted using discount rates appropriate for each CGU, and these are reviewed annually.
The pre-tax rates used for the 2017 review are as follows - 10.8% for Asset Solutions EAAA, 10.6% for Asset Solutions Americas, 11.4% for Specialist Technical Solutions 10.3% for Environment and Infrastructure Solutions and 10.7% for Investment Services the equivalent post-tax rates are 9.5%, 9.25%, 10.0%, 9.25% and 9.5% respectively.
The carrying value of the goodwill for each CGU is shown in the table below.
No goodwill has been written off during the current or prior year.
Cash Generating Unit Goodwill carrying value $m Asset Solutions EAAA 2,033.6 Asset Solutions Americas 1,754.7 Specialist Technical Solutions 921.8 Environment and Infrastructure Solutions 489.0 Investment Services 160.1 A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis of a 1% reduction in the long term growth rate and a 1% increase in the discount rate in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review.
A 1% reduction in the long term growth rate would result in an impairment of $166.9m in Assets Solutions EAAA.
A 1% increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment of $242.7m in Asset Solutions EAAA.
In addition, if the short term EBITA growth rates assumed by management for Asset Solutions EAAA in 2018 and 2019 were 3% lower than projected then an impairment would result.
The lower headroom in Asset Solutions EAAA is primarily due to challenging market conditions in the North Sea.
The sensitivity analysis did not identify any potential impairments other than those mentioned above for Asset Solutions EAAA.
Intangible assets arising on acquisition include the valuation of customer contracts and relationships, order backlog and brands recognised on business combinations.
As part of the annual impairment review, Group management has assessed whether there were any impairment triggers and none were identified.

The Group has a 51% shareholding in EthosEnergy, a provider of rotating equipment services and solutions to the power, oil and gas and industrial markets.
EthosEnergy is based in Aberdeen, Scotland.
The Group has a 50% shareholding in RWG, a provider of repair and overhaul services to the oil and gas, power generation and marine propulsion industries.
RWG is based in Aberdeen, Scotland.
The assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the EthosEnergy and RWG are shown below.
The financial information below has been extracted from the management accounts for these entities.
Managements estimate of fair value less costs of disposal is $77.0m which is lower than the book value and an impairment charge of $28.0m has been recorded in the income statement.
The fair value is supported by third party market data.
If fair value less costs of disposal are ultimately less than $77.0m then a further impairment will be required.
EthosEnergy has also recorded impairment losses of $1.1m Wood Group share relating to the closure of its power solutions business.
This charge is reflected in the exceptional expense line in the table below.
EthosEnergys net borrowings, including parent company loans, at 31 December 2017 amounted to $92.6m.

For internal reporting this amount is netted with short-term overdrafts and presented as a net figure on the Groups balance sheet.
However, in preparing these financial statements, the Group has grossed up both its cash and borrowings figures by this amount.
The effective interest rate on short-term deposits at 31 December 2017 was 1.62% and these deposits have an average maturity of 13 days.
At 31 December 2017, the Group held $20.6m of cash in Angolan kwanza.
Due to the lack of US dollars in country the Group has experienced challenges in converting its kwanza cash balances and repatriating funds.
During January 2018, the value of the kwanza was devalued by around 30% against the US dollar and further devaluation of the currency is forecast during 2018.
The Group will continue to explore opportunities to repatriate this cash however the devaluation of the cash balance will have an impact on the Groups 2018 profits.

The Group entered into new banking facilities on the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler.
Total facilities of $2.75bn comprise a 5 year $1.75bn revolving credit facility and a $1bn 3 year term loan.
The Group has $375.0m of unsecured senior loan notes issued in the US private placement market.
The notes mature in 2021, 2024 and 2026 and interest is payable at an average fixed rate of 3.74%.

17 Financial instruments The Groups activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Groups Treasury policies.
Group Treasury, together with the Groups business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks.
The Groups Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Groups profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geo-political uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
104 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 17 Financial instruments continued a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group has subsidiary companies whose revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts.
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is recorded in equity.
Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk cash flow hedges The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges at the balance sheet date are shown in the table below.

Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk fair value through income statement The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of all other forward contracts and currency swaps at the balance sheet date are shown in the table below.

Movements in the sterling US dollar rate impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
The potential impact of changes in the sterling US dollar exchange rate is summarised in the table below.
As the Group reports in US dollars a weakening of the pound has a negative impact on translation of its sterling companies profits and net assets.

The Group also has foreign exchange risk in relation a number of other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro.
ii Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and debt.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at a mixture of fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At 31 December 2017, 15% 2016: 53% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits and where possible, deposit cash with a financial institution with a credit rating of A or better.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 105 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 17 Financial instruments continued Hedging of interest rate risk cash flow hedges The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at the balance sheet date are shown in the table below.

If average interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during 2017 2016: 1%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $4.5m lower or higher respectively 2016: $0.7m.
1% has been used in this calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
Immediately following the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler, the Group repaid AFWs existing bank borrowings.
As part of that transaction, a net payment of $21.3m was made to close out debt related derivative financial instruments.
iii Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
b Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
Responsibility for managing credit risk lies within the businesses with support being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
The credit risk associated with customers is considered as part of each tender review process and is addressed initially through contract payment terms.
Trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance are used to manage credit risk where appropriate.
Credit control practices are applied thereafter during the project execution phase.
A right to interest and suspension is normally sought in all contracts.
There is significant management focus on customers that are classified as high risk in the current challenging market although the Group had no material write offs in the year.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Where a customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be obtained.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of trade receivables.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance.
A table showing trade receivables and receivable days is provided in note 12.
Receivable days calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits more than three months at 31December2017 was $1,283.2m.
The Group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid any over exposure to any one counterparty.
The Groups policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of A or better where possible.
52% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2017 was held with such institutions.
c Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to ensure the availability of an appropriate amount of funding to meet both current and future forecast requirements consistent with the Groups budget and strategic plans.
The Group will finance operations and growth from its existing cash resources and the $835.5m undrawn portion of the Groups committed banking facilities.
At 31 December 2017, 100% 2016: 100% of the Groups principal borrowing facilities including senior loan notes were due to mature in more than one year.
Based on the Groups latest forecasts the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
The Group has $375m of unsecured senior loan notes issued in the US private placement market.
106 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 17 Financial instruments continued d Capital risk The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure.
The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and when applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing total EBITA by net finance expense.
Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2017 was 7.0 times 2016: 14.1 times.
The ratio of net debt to proforma EBITDA at 31 December 2017 was 2.4 2016: 0.8.
The calculation of proforma EBITDA is prepared as if Amec Foster Wheeeler and CEC were acquired on 1 January 2017.
Deferred and contingent consideration Deferred and contingent consideration is payable on the acquisition of businesses based on earn out arrangements and is initially recognised at fair value.
The amount payable is dependent on the post-acquisition profits of the acquired entities and the provision made is based on the Groups estimate of the likely profits of those entities based on the relevant Acquisition Approval Paper submitted to the Group Board.
Where actual profits are higher or lower than the Groups estimate and the amount of contingent consideration payable is consequently different to the amount estimated then the variance is charged or credited to the income statement.
Where deferred and contingent consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
The fair value of contingent consideration is not based on observable market data and as such the valuation method is classified as level 3 as per above.
The process for valuation is consistently applied to all acquisitions.
The table below presents the changes in level 3 financial instruments during the year: Contingent consideration arising from business combinations $m At 1 January 92.7 Exchange movements 1.8 Amounts provided in relation to new acquisitions 14.0 Interest relating to discounting of contingent consideration 2.3 Payments during the year 32.1 Amounts released to the income statement 17.5 At 31 December 61.2 Financial liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Drawdowns under the bilateral bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and therefore loan interest payable is excluded from the amounts below.

Drawdowns under long-term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
Fair values excluding the fair value of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are determined using observable market prices level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement as follows: The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market rates.
All derivative fair values are verified by comparison to valuations provided by the derivative counterparty banks.
The Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, there were no transfers into or out of level 2 fair value measurements.

Plaintiffs claim damages for personal injury alleged to have arisen from exposure to asbestos primarily in connection with equipment allegedly manufactured by certain Group companies in the 1970s or earlier.
It is expected that these subsidiaries will be named as defendants in additional and or similar suits and that new claims will be filed in the future.
Whilst some of these claims have been and are expected to be made in the UK, the overwhelming majority have been and are expected to be made in the US.
The Groups asbestos related liabilities were assumed on the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler.
Management has worked with independent asbestos valuation experts to measure the asbestos related liabilities assumed.
Asbestos related liabilities recognised by the Group include estimates of indemnity amounts and defence costs expected to be incurred in each year in the period to 2050, beyond which time management expects that there will no longer be a significant number of open claims.
Managements estimates are based on the following information and assumptions - the number of open claims, the forecasted number of future claims, the estimated average cost per claim by disease type mesothelioma, lung cancer and non-malignancies, claim filings which result in no monetary payments the zero pay rate as well as other factors.
108 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 18 Provisions continued In recent years, certain of the Groups subsidiaries have entered into settlement agreements calling for insurers to make lump sum payments, as well as payments over time, for use by our subsidiaries to fund asbestos-related indemnity and defence costs, and, in certain cases, for reimbursement for portions of out of pocket costs incurred.
Asbestos related insurance recoveries under executed settlement agreements are recognised in trade and other receivables together with managements best estimate of actual and probable insurance recoveries relating to the Groups liability for pending and estimated future asbestos claims in the period to 2050.
The Groups actual insurance recoveries may be limited by future insolvencies among its insurers.
The Group does not recognise insurance recoveries due from currently insolvent insurers unless they are subject to court approved settlement in liquidation proceedings.
The Group has discounted the expected future cash flows with respect to the asbestos related liabilities and the expected insurance recoveries using discount rates determined by reference to appropriate risk free market interest rates.
Asbestos related liabilities and assets recognised on the Groups balance sheet were as follows: 2017 2016 US UK Total US UK Total $m $m $m $m $m $m Asbestos related provision Gross provision 589.0 73.2 662.2 - - - Effect of discounting 99.8 - 99.8 - - - Net provision 489.2 73.2 562.4 - - - Insurance recoveries Gross recoveries 66.8 68.5 135.3 - - - Effect of discounting 2.9 - 2.9 - - - Net recoveries 63.9 68.5 132.4 - - - Net asbestos related liabilities 425.3 4.7 430.0 - - - The net asbestos provision of $562.4m 2016: nil is made up of $511.6m included in provisions 2016: nil and $50.8m 2016: nil in respect of asbestos liabilities included in trade and other payables.
Estimation of asbestos related liabilities and insurance recoveries is subject to a number of uncertainties that may result in significant changes to the current estimates.
Among these are uncertainties as to the ultimate number and type of claims filed, the amounts of claim costs, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies with asbestos claims, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, as well as potential legislative changes.
Fluctuations in market interest rates and the uncertainties noted above could cause significant changes in the discounted amount of the asbestos related liabilities and insurance recoveries.
Project and environmental litigation The Group is party to litigation involving clients and sub-contractors arising out of project contracts.
Management has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known or reasonably likely legal claims and actions by and against the Group.
Where a known or likely claim or action is identified, management carefully assesses the likelihood of success of the claim or action.
Generally, a provision is recognised only in respect of those claims or actions where management consider it is probable that a settlement will be required.
Additionally, however, the Group recognises provisions for known or likely claims against an acquired business if, at the acquisition date, it is possible that the claim or action will be successful and its amount can be reliably estimated.
Provision is made for managements best estimate of the likely settlement costs and or damages to be awarded for those claims and actions that management considers are likely to be successful.
Due to the inherent commercial, legal and technical uncertainties in estimating project claims, the amounts ultimately paid or realised by the Group could differ materially from the amounts that are recognised in the financial statements.
An estimate of future legal costs is included only in the litigation provision acquired from Amec Foster Wheeler as on a fair value basis it is reasonable to include this as it reflects what would be paid by a third party to assume the liability.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 109 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 18 Provisions continued Chemical Plant Litigation in the United States In 2013, one of Amec Foster Wheeler plcs subsidiaries contracted to engineer, procure and construct a chemical plant for a client in Texas.
In December 2015 the client partially terminated the contract and in September 2016, terminated the remainder of the contract and commenced a lawsuit in Texas against the subsidiary and also Amec Foster Wheeler plc, seeking damages for breach of contract and warranty, gross negligence, and fraud.
The claim amount is unspecified but the client alleges that the projected cost for the assigned scope of work is approximately $700 million above the alleged estimate and that the subsidiarys delays have caused it to suffer continuing monthly damages of $25 million due to the fact that the facility is not complete and it is not able to sell the expected products from the facility.
The client seeks recovery of actual and punitive damages, as well as the disgorgement of the full project fixed fee paid to the subsidiary approximately $66.5 million.
The Group believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit.
The estimate that the subsidiary provided was in connection with the clients initial request for a lump sum bid and highly conditioned.
The contract that was ultimately signed, and which governs the dispute, is a reimbursable cost plus fixed fee contract, with no guaranteed price or schedule, wherein the client assumed joint responsibility for management of the work and development of the project schedule.
Liability for consequential damages is barred, except in the case of wilful misconduct.
Except for gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and warranty claims, overall liability is capped at 10 percent of the contract price or approximately $100 million.
Amec Foster Wheeler has denied the claims and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit.
The lawsuit is in the early stages of proceedings and it would be premature to predict the ultimate outcome of the matter.
The Group has a provision of $73.5m as at 31 December 2017 on this project against disallowed costs and warranties, which includes $35.5m of estimated legal fees included as a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler.
Environmental litigation Certain of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, in particular the US and the EU, have environmental laws under which current and past owners or operators of property may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of removal or remediation of toxic or hazardous substances on or under their property, regardless of whether such materials were released in violation of law and whether the operator or owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such substances.
Largely as a consequence of the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler, the Group currently owns and operates, or owned and operated, industrial facilities.
It is likely that, as a result of the Groups current or former operations, hazardous substances have affected the property on which those facilities are or were situated.
The Group has also received and may continue to receive claims pursuant to indemnity obligations from the present owners of facilities we have transferred, which may require us to incur costs for investigation and or remediation.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group held provisions totalling $35.9m for the estimated future environmental clean-up costs in relation to industrial facilities that it no longer operates.
Whilst the timing of the related cash flows is typically uncertain, the Group expects that certain of its remediation obligations may continue for up to 60 years.
Obligations related to disposed businesses As described in note 32, the Group agreed to indemnify certain third parties relating to businesses and or assets that were previously owned by the Group and were sold to them.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group recognised indemnity provisions totalling $101.1m.
Indemnity provisions principally relate to businesses that were sold by Amec Foster Wheeler prior to its acquisition by the Group.
Other provisions At 31 December 2017, other provisions of $104.5m 2016: $62.5m have been recognised.
This amount includes warranty provisions in respect of guarantees provided in the normal course of business relating to contract performance.
It is expected that any payment required in respect of these provisions would be made within two years.
Included within the reclassifications line is $13.4m of unfavourable leases which the Group had previously included within other provisions but are now shown in other non-current liabilities.

We expect all other earnings to be continually reinvested by the Group.
There is no tax expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future and as a result no deferred tax is provided.
Recognition of $85.9m of deferred tax assets in relation to the US tax group is based on forecast profits of the US businesses.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $5,824.6m 2016: $164.3m to carry forward against future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

The charge to operating profit for these schemes for the year amounted to $10.2m 2016: $10.7m.
This included $0.6m relating to the roll-over of Amec Foster Wheeler awards under their Long Term Incentive Plan into Wood Group awards.
In addition, an amount of $2.1m has been allocated to the acquisition consideration see note 28.
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below.
ESOS and LTRP For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of 25% for ESOS and 20% for LTRP.
The share price volatility used in the calculation of 40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk free rate of return is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
Long Term Plan The Groups Long Term Plan LTP was introduced during 2013.
There are two distinct awards made under the LTP.
Nil value share options will be awarded on the same basis as awards under the LTRP see above.
In addition, awards to senior management are made based on achievement of performance measures, these being total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Participants may be granted conditional share awards or nil cost options at the start of the cycle.
Performance is measured over a three year period and up to 80% of an award may vest based on the performance over that period.
The vesting of at least 20% of any award is normally deferred for a further period of at least two years.
Performance based awards Details of the LTP awards are set out in the table below.
The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award.
Further details of the LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.

These awards were converted to Wood Group awards following the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler on 6 October 2017.
The fair value of these awards is 7.00.
The awards outstanding under cycles 5, 6 and 7 represent 20% of the award at vesting which is deferred for two years.
Further details on the LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Share options A summary of the basis for the charge for ESOS, LTRP and LTP options is set out below together with the number of options granted, exercised and lapsed during the year.
Long Term Retention Plan The following options granted under the Groups LTRP were outstanding at 31 December: Number of ordinary shares under option Exercise price Year of Grant 2017 2016 per share Exercise period 2 2012 - 48,875 4 p 2016-2017 7 2 2013 73,947 433,187 4 p 2017-2018 7 73,947 482,062 Options are granted under the Groups LTRP at par value.
There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of options under the LTRP.
There are performance criteria relating to the creation of the pool available but none relating to the exercise of the options.
Employee share plan The Group introduced an Employee Share Plan during 2016.
Under the plan employees contribute regular monthly amounts which are used to purchase shares over a one year period.
At the end of the year, the participating employees are awarded one free share for every three shares purchased, providing they remain in employment for a further year.
It is estimated that 183,999 shares will be awarded at the end of the first year of the scheme.
Amec Foster Wheeler also has an Employee Share Plan.
Awards under this scheme were converted to Wood Group awards following the acquisition on 6 October 2017.
At 31 December 2017, 1,099,016 options were outstanding under this scheme.

118 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 28 Acquisitions and divestments On 6 October 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Amec Foster Wheeler plc.
The acquisition was completed through the issue of 294,510,217 new Wood Group shares for a value of $2,807.3m.
In addition, $2.1m relating to share awards to Amec Foster Wheeler employees was allocated to the purchase consideration.
The assets and liabilities acquired in respect of the Amec Foster Wheeler acquisition were as follows: Provisional acquired balance sheet $m Property, plant and equipment 83.4 Intangible assets recognised on acquisition 1,343.6 Other intangible assets 35.1 Investment in joint ventures 55.5 Retirement benefit schemes surplus 147.3 Long term receivables 167.3 Inventories 6.7 Trade and other receivables 1,861.4 Assets held for sale 582.6 Bank deposits more than 3 months 30.1 Cash and cash equivalents 443.7 Borrowings 1,809.7 Finance leases 49.5 Trade and other payables 1,902.8 Liabilities held for sale 326.2 Current tax 149.1 Deferred tax 219.7 Provisions 822.4 Non-current liabilities 181.2 Total identifiable net liabilities acquired 703.9 Non-controlling interests 1.2 705.1 Goodwill 3,514.5 Consideration 2,809.4 Consideration satisfied by: Issue of shares 2,807.3 Share based charges allocated to consideration 2.1 2,809.4 The acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler accelerates the Groups strategy, increases the range of customer relationships, facilitates development of technology enabled solutions and broadens end market, geographic and customer exposure.
It will provide enhanced capability and diversification across oil and gas, chemicals, renewables, environmental and infrastructure and mining segments.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on acquisition.
Amec Foster Wheelers skilled workforce did not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition and thus also contributed to the goodwill recognised.
The accounting for the acquisition is provisional and will be finalised in the next accounting period.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 119 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 28 Acquisitions and divestments continued Intangible assets of $1,343.6m, representing the fair value of customer relationships, order backlog and brands have been recorded in relation to the acquisition.
Deferred tax liabilities of $261.5m have been recognised in relation to intangible assets.
Fair value adjustments of $104.5m have been made to the acquisition balance sheet.
This amount includes $37.1m of additional contract liabilities, $42.6m of anticipated legal fees to defend claims against the Group, $19.1m of additional insurance captive liabilities in order to align with Wood Group policy and $5.7m of other adjustments.
In addition, an adjustment of $57.5m has been recorded to align Amec Foster Wheelers revenue recognition policy on lump sum contracts with Wood Groups policy and $49.4m of additional tax provisions have also been recorded.
The Group has used acquisition accounting for the purchase of Amec Foster Wheeler and, in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, the goodwill arising on consolidation of $3,514.5m has been capitalised.
The adjusted trade and other receivables acquired of $1,861.4m, net of provisions, are expected to be recovered in full.
Gross trade and other receivables acquired, before provisions and fair value adjustments amounted to $1,974.2m.
Long term receivables acquired amounted to $167.3m.
In May 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of CEC Controls Inc CEC, a designer and builder of industrial and process control systems for the automotive manufacturing industry based in Detroit, USA.
The assets and liabilities acquired in respect of the CEC acquisition were as follows: $m Property, plant and equipment 0.4 Intangible assets recognised on acquisition 12.3 Trade and other receivables 19.6 Cash and cash equivalents 3.8 Trade and other payables 6.6 Total identifiable net assets acquired 29.5 Goodwill 38.8 Consideration 68.3 Consideration satisfied by: Cash 54.3 Deferred and contingent consideration 14.0 68.3 Contingent consideration has been provided in relation to the CEC acquisition and is payable over the next 3 years.
The amount payable is dependent on post-acquisition profits and the provision made is based on the Groups estimate of the likely profits of the entity.
Where deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
The acquisition of CEC gives that company access to the Groups wider client base and use of the Groups resources to further grow and develop its businesses contributing to the goodwill recognised on the acquisition.
The Group has used acquisition accounting for the purchase of CEC and, in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, the goodwill arising on consolidation of $38.8m has been capitalised.
Intangible assets of $12.3m, representing the fair value of customer contracts and relationships, have been recorded in relation to the acquisition of CEC.
Trade and other receivables acquired of $19.6m are expected to be recovered in full.
The accounting for the acquisition will be finalised in the next accounting period.

122 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 30 Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
The assets of the defined benefits schemes are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds.
These schemes are largely closed to future accrual.
As well as the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefit Scheme, the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler added a number of further defined benefit schemes, the most significant of which are the Amec Foster Wheeler Pension Plan and the Foster Wheeler Inc Salaried Employees Pension Plan.
The valuations used have been based on the final valuation of the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefit Scheme as at 5 April 2016, the preliminary valuation of Amec Foster Wheeler Pension Plan as at 31 March 2017 and the valuation of the Foster Wheeler Inc Pension Plan as at 1 January 2017.
The scheme valuations have been updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2017.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December 2017.
Scheme membership at the balance sheet date was as follows 2017 2017 2017 2016 JWG AFW FW Inc JWG PLC Pension Pension PLC RBS Plan Plan RBS Deferred members 689 9,766 1,570 724 Pensioner members 419 9,546 3,234 397 The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2017 2017 2017 2016 JWG AFW FW Inc JWG PLC Pension Pension PLC RBS Plan Plan RBS % % % % Discount rate 2.5 2.5 3.4 2.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.2 2.7 N A 3.5 Rate of retail price index inflation 3.3 3.1 N A 3.6 Rate of consumer price index inflation 2.3 N A N A 2.6 The mortality assumptions used to determine pension liabilities in the three schemes at 31 December 2017 were as follows Scheme Mortality assumption JWG PLC RBS S2NA mortality tables with CMI 2015 projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% pa AFW Pension Plan Scheme specific table with CMI 2016 projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% pa FW Inc Pension Plan RP-2014 Employee and Annuitant tables for males and females with generational projection using scale MMP-2016 with no collar adjustments John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 123 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 30 Retirement benefit schemes continued The mortality tables use data appropriate to each of the Groups schemes adjusted to allow for expected future improvements in mortality using the latest projections.
Scheme risks The retirement benefit schemes are exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are - Volatility The defined benefit obligation is measured with reference to corporate bond yields and if scheme assets underperform relative to this yield, this will create a deficit, all other things being equal.
The scheme investments are well diversified such that the failure of a single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the defined benefit obligation.
This would however be offset to some extent by a corresponding increase in the value of the schemes bond asset holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of benefits in deferment and in payment are linked to price inflation so higher actual inflation and higher assumed inflation will increase the defined benefit obligation.
Life expectancy The defined benefit obligation is generally made up of benefits payable for life and so increases to members life expectancies will increase the defined benefit obligation, all other things being equal.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 127 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 30 Retirement benefit schemes continued Sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation The impact of changes to the key assumptions on the retirement benefit obligation is shown below.
The sensitivity is based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.

The Group operates a SERP pension arrangement in the US for certain employees.
During the year, the Group made contributions of $0.6m 2016: $0.6m to the arrangement.
Contributions are invested in a portfolio of US funds and the fair value of the funds at the balance sheet date are recognised by the Group as a long term receivable.
Investments held by the Group at 31 December amounted to $83.8m 2016: $77.4m and will be used to pay benefits when employees retire.
The corresponding liability is recorded in other non-current liabilities.

128 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 32 Contingent liabilities Cross guarantees At the balance sheet date, the Group had cross guarantees without limit extended to its principal bankers in respect of sums advanced to subsidiaries.
Legal Claims From time to time, the Group is notified of claims in respect of work carried out.
Where management believes we are in a strong position to defend these claims no provision is made.
Employment claims The Group is aware of challenges to historic employment practices which may have an impact on the Group, including the application of National Insurance Contributions to workers in the UK Continental Shelf.
In addition, previous court cases have challenged the UKs historic interpretation of EU legislation relating to holiday pay and this may have an impact on all companies who have employees in the UK, including the Group.
At this point, we do not believe that it is probable that a liability, if any, will arise from any of these claims and therefore no provision has been made.
Indemnities and retained obligations The Group has agreed to indemnify certain third parties relating to businesses and or assets that were previously owned by the Group and were sold to them.
Such indemnifications relate primarily to breach of covenants, breach of representations and warranties, as well as potential exposure for retained liabilities, environmental matters and third party claims for activities conducted by the Group prior to the sale of such businesses and or assets.
We have established provisions for those indemnities in respect of which we consider it probable that there will be a successful claim.
We do not expect indemnities or retained obligations for which a provision has not been established to have a material impact on the Groups financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Guarantees In 2016, one of the Groups subsidiaries disposed of a refinery electricity generation plant located in Chile.
A condition of the disposal was that the subsidiary was required to sign an operation and maintenance contract with the purchaser.
This has resulted in a number of performance obligations with respect to refinery output and electricity generation by the plant.
Mount Polley The Mount Polley mine is owned and operated by Mount Polley Mining Corporation, a subsidiary of Imperial Metals Corporation, and is located near the town of Likely, British Columbia, Canada.
On 4 August 2014, a tailings pond facility at the mine failed releasing large quantities of water and mine tailings into the local environment.
The dam was in the process of being raised as part of its annual raise at the time of the failure.
One of Amec Foster Wheelers subsidiaries, along with other parties, had various design and quality assurance responsibilities associated with the development of this facility.
Amec Foster Wheelers subsidiary was providing engineering services at the time of the breach, but did not perform the original design.
An independent review panel, appointed by the government of British Columbia, issued a report on 30 January 2015 concluding that the cause of failure was shearing along a zone of weak soil along with other contributory factors.
On 17 December 2015, the chief inspector of mines for British Columbia issued a report that for the most part agreed with the conclusions of the independent review panel.
Whilst the chief inspector concluded that there were failings in the required standard of care of all of the engineers, he concluded that the responsibility for the breach lies primarily with the mine owner, Mount Polley Mining Corporation.
He also concluded that there was no evidence of any significant contravention of regulatory requirements.
On 4 July 2016, Mount Polley Mining Corporation and Imperial Metals Corporation filed a suit against Amec Foster Wheelers subsidiary and others.
The claim seeks C$3 million in costs payable to government agencies and unspecified damages for loss of profit, reconstruction costs and environmental remediation.
Subsequent to this filing, several tourist operators and First Nations also filed suit alleging that they suffered damages as a result of the tailings facility failure.
It is Amec Foster Wheeler managements opinion that its employees performed in a professional manner consistent with the standard of care for a competent engineer on a project of this nature in British Columbia.
In addition, the contracts between Amec Foster Wheelers subsidiary and Mount Polley Mining Corporation contain limitation of liability provisions that exclude claims for consequential damages and limit the subsidiarys liability to Mount Polley Mining Corporation to the amount of professional fees charged, which were less than C$1 million.
The Group has retained outside counsel and filed a response to Mount Polley Mining Corporations civil claim on 23 September 2016.
Given the early stage of this matter, it is difficult to predict the likely outcome of this proceeding.
Mindful of the foregoing caveat, it is managements opinion that it is probable that there will be an outflow in respect of this issue with liability shared with the other parties, but it is probable that if there is an outflow to Mount Polley Mining Corporation, it will be limited to the prescribed contractual limitation of liability referenced above.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 129 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 32 Contingent liabilities continued Investigations Amec Foster Wheeler has received voluntary requests for information from, and continues to cooperate with, the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and the US Department of Justice DOJ in connection with their ongoing investigations into Amec Foster Wheeler in relation to Unaoil and in relation to historical use of agents and certain other business counterparties by Amec Foster Wheeler and its legacy companies primarily in the Middle East.
In addition, Amec Foster Wheeler has provided information relating to the historical use of third parties by legacy Amec Foster Wheeler companies in certain other regions to the SEC and DOJ.
Amec Foster Wheeler made a disclosure to the UK Serious Fraud Office SFO about these matters and, in April 2017, in connection with the SFOs investigation into Unaoil, the SFO required Amec Foster Wheeler to produce information relating to any relationship of Amec Foster Wheeler with Unaoil or certain other third parties.
In July 2017, the SFO opened an investigation into Amec Foster Wheeler, predecessor companies and associated persons.
The investigation focuses on the past use of third parties and possible bribery and corruption and related offences and relates to various jurisdictions.
The Group is co-operating with and assisting the SFO in relation to this investigation.
Notifications of certain matters within the above investigations have also been made to the relevant authority in Brazil namely, the Federal Prosecution Service.
Independently, the Group has conducted an internal investigation into the historical engagement of Unaoil by legacy Wood Group companies, reviewing information available to the Group in this context.
This internal investigation confirmed that a legacy Wood Group joint venture engaged Unaoil and that the joint venture made payments to Unaoil under agency agreements.
The Group has informed the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service COPFS, the relevant authority in Scotland, of the findings of the internal investigation.
The Group understands that COPFS and the SFO are, in line with the memorandum of understanding between them, liaising to consider which authority will be responsible for the matter going forward.
The Group is co-operating with and assisting the authorities in connection with this matter.
At this time it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the liability, if any, that may arise in relation to any of the above matters and therefore no provision has been made for them in the financial statements.
Tax planning The Group undertakes tax planning which is compliant with current legislation and accepted practice.
Recent changes to the tax environment, including the OECDs project around Base Erosion and Profit Shifting have brought into question tax planning previously undertaken by multinational entities.
There have been several recent high profile tax cases against tax authorities and large groups.
The European Commission continues formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain European countries comply with European Union rules, and has issued judgements in some cases which are being contested by the groups and the countries effected.
The Group is monitoring the outcome of these cases in order to understand whether there is any risk to the Group.
Specifically the EC has challenged the UK Controlled Foreign Companies CFC rules in relation to an exemption for certain financing income.
Based on the Groups current assessment of such issues, it is too early to speculate on the likelihood of liabilities arising, and as a result, it is not currently considered probable that there will be an outflow in respect of these issues.
33 Capital and other financial commitments 2017 2016 $m $m Contracts placed for future capital expenditure not provided in the financial statements 18.5 8.1 The capital expenditure above relates to property plant and equipment.
In addition, joint venture companies have commitments amounting to $2.2m.
34 Related party transactions The following transactions were carried out with the Groups joint ventures.
These transactions comprise sales and purchases of goods and services and funding provided in the ordinary course of business.
The receivables include loans to joint venture companies.
