In this Note i Those statements form the basis of the dividend decisions made by the section Accounting Directors, as explained in detail in note viii below.
These financial statements policies were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Basis of preparation The Company is a qualifying entity as it is a member of the ITV plc Group where ITV plc, the ultimate parent, prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements.
Exemptions applied The Company is taking advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: Presentation of a Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure of key management personnel compensation: Disclosure of related party transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries and parents within a group: Disclosures required under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments: Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosure: Certain disclosures required under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: and Disclosure of information in relation to new standards not yet applied.
As permitted by section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement dealing with the results of the parent company has not been presented.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The investment in the Companys subsidiaries is recorded at cost.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The difference between initial fair value and the redemption value is recorded in the profit and loss account over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest and other foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the profit and loss account within net financing costs, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
In this case, the effective portion of cash flow hedge is recognised in retained profits within equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassified to the profit and loss account in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is realised.
Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
18 181 1 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the ITV plc Company Financial Statements continued The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Companys derivatives.
The valuation techniques use inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations between inputs.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss, the fair value change and interest income expense are not separated.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
The Company recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due, which require judgement.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement or directly in equity according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Recognition of deferred tax assets therefore involves judgement regarding timing and level of future taxable income.
Share-based compensation The Company utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration packages, and therefore operates a number of share-based compensation schemes, namely the Deferred Share Award DSA, Performance Share Plan PSP, Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Save As You Earn SAYE schemes.
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Company receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
If the Company incurs a liability based on the price or value of the shares, this will also fall under a share-based transaction.
The Company recognises the retained earnings impact of the share-based compensation for the Group as awards are settled in ITV plc shares.
The cost of providing those awards is recharged to subsidiaries that receive the service from employees.
The fair value of the equity instrument granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for the SAYE scheme, a BlackScholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions.
For performance-based schemes, the relevant performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order to determine the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate is then used to determine the option fair value, discounted to present value.
The Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares.
No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA.
During the year, all exercises were satisfied by using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees Benefit Trust.
The Trust is accounted for as a separate entity and therefore is only accounted for in the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.
