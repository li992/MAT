Deferred tax assets recognised on short-term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are forecast taxable profits in the entities concerned.
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 19.8m 2016: 94.1m.
The only tax that would arise on these reserves would be non-recoverable withholding tax.
