All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates.
Metal assays were capped where appropriate.
Mineral resources are reported at variable metal, metal equivalent or NSR cut-off grades and assuming reasonable metal recoveries.
Orisyvo, Lucerito, Candamea, Rodeo and Guachichil mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on appropriate mining and processing costs and metal recoveries for oxide and sulfide material.
Equivalent metal grades and conceptual pit optimization are based on US$1,250 per ounce of gold, US$17.00 per ounce of silver US$1,400 per ounce of gold, US$17.50 per ounce of silver for the Orisyvo project, US$1.20 per pound of zinc and US$1.00 per pound of lead.
2 Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries.
