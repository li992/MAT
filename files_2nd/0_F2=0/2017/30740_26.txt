NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For tHe year enDeD 31 DecemBer 2017 Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000.
Rotork plc is a company domiciled in England.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The accounting policies contained below in note 1 and the disclosures in notes 2 to 30 all relate to the Group financial statements.
The Company balance sheet, accounting policies and applicable notes can be found following note 30.
Accounting policies The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Rotork plc have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention subject to the items referred to in the derivative financial instruments accounting policy below.
New accounting standards and interpretations In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IAS 12.
Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle Amendments to IFRS 12.
Application of these standards and amendments has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group.
An assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.
i. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted.
Except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required but providing comparative information is not compulsory.
For hedge accounting, the requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date and will not restate comparative information.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and amended in April 2016, and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
During 2017, the Group performed a detailed analysis of significant revenue streams in 2016, communicated to key stakeholders within the business the key aspects of the accounting change and had specific targeted training for key finance employees.
In early 2018, further work targeted service revenue in 2017 to assess the impact of the change over the transition date.
This analysis has enabled management to assess the impact of the new standard on the 2016 and 2017 balance sheets and the 2017 income statement.
An explanation of the impact on the key revenue streams is set out below.
Contracts for the sale of products are generally expected to have only one performance obligation and adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have any impact on the Groups revenue and profit or loss.
The Group expects the revenue recognition to occur at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.
The Group provides service and support through preventative maintenance contracts, on-site and workshop service, retrofit solutions and the Client Support Programme.
The Groups current accounting treatment under IAS 18 is that revenue on long-term service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion.
Under IFRS 15, management have concluded that the long-term service contracts are satisfied over time given that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group.
For other service work revenue will be recognised on completion of the work and after all performance obligations have been completed.
Adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material impact on service revenue in the income statement or the balance sheet.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 and the impact of the changes set out above are not expected to require any restatement of the 2017 balance sheet and income statement.

IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees.
IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when it becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer.
Distinctions of operating leases off balance sheet and finance leases on balance sheet are removed for lessee accounting, and are replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by lessees i. e. all on balance sheet except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost subject to certain exceptions less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date.
Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others.
Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows: whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively.
Extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 16.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 19,268,000.
IAS 17 does not require the recognition of any right-of-use asset or liability for future payments for these leases: instead, certain information is disclosed as operating lease commitments in note 27.
A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16, and hence the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these leases unless they qualify for low value or short-term leases upon the application of IFRS 16.
The new requirement to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability is expected to have an impact on the amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements and management are currently assessing its potential impact.
It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until this review is completed.
In contrast, for finance leases where the Group is a lessee, as the Group has already recognised an asset and a related finance lease liability for the lease arrangement, management do not anticipate that the application of IFRS 16 will have an impact on the amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Adjustments to profit Adjustments to profit are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation.
These specific items are presented on the face of the income statement to provide greater clarity and a better understanding of the impact of these items on the Groups financial performance.
In doing so, it also facilitates greater comparison of the Groups underlying results with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
This split is consistent with how underlying business performance is measured internally.
Adjustments to profit items may include but are not restricted to: costs of significant business restructuring, significant impairments of intangible or tangible assets, adjustments to the fair value of acquisition related items such as contingent consideration, acquired intangible asset amortisation and other items due to their significance, size or nature, and the related taxation.
Acquired intangible asset amortisation has been shown separately to provide visibility over the ongoing impact on the Groups income statement of prior and current year period investment activities.
Further analysis of the adjustments to profit are provided in note 4 to the financial statements.
Going concern After carrying out a detailed review of the viability of the business, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In forming this view, the directors have considered trading and cash flow forecasts, financial commitments, the significant order book with customers spread across different geographic areas and industries and the net debt position.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2017.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains or losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company is expressed in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates at the dates the values were determined.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates approximating those ruling at the date of the transactions.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign entities are not presented as a separate component.
Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services.
Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities.
Revenue from the sale of actuators, gearboxes and flow control products is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the contracted shipping terms.
Revenue from service work is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: The fair value of the consideration transferred: plus The recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus The fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less The net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed are provisional for a 12 month period.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets i Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of up to five years and is written off on a straight line basis.
R RO OT TO OR RK A K AN NN NU UA AL R L RE EP PO OR RT 2 T 20 01 17 7 10 100 0 overview StrateGic report Governance Financial StatementS company inFormation ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on discussions with the management of the acquired business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the intangibles acquired.
The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired are as follows: Brands and trademarks 4 to 10 years Customer relationships 2 to 8 years Product design patents 4 to 8 years Order backlog 3 months to 1 year Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less than 50 years.
Other assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 10% to 33% Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation.
Leases Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations under finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the operating profit.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Taxation Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
The net realisable value in respect of old and slow moving inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns and forecast future usage.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term with an original maturity less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Equity Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares are debited directly to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.

Accounting policies continued Provisions i Warranties A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.
ii Contingent consideration The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of the purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash at a future date, depends on uncertain future events.
The amounts recognised in the financial statements represent a fair value estimate at the balance sheet date of the amounts expected to be paid.
Employee benefits i Pension plans Where the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, contributions are made in accordance with the schedule of contributions agreed with the Trustees.
In respect of all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of the plans, these are recognised in equity.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within financing expenses.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payment transactions The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork plc at a discounted price compared with the market price at the time of grant.
Details of the scheme are given in note 25.
The fair value of the right option is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity.
The right option reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled.
The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Long Term Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers.
These awards may vest after a period of three years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met.
Details of the grants are given in note 25.
The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a result of non-market performance conditions not being met.
The overseas profit linked share plan OPLSS and the share incentive plan SIP are discretionary profit linked share schemes based on the prior year profit of the participating Rotork companies.
The value of the award to each employee is based on salary and the length of service, the value of the awards can be up to 3,600.
Shares awarded under these schemes are issued by the trustee at the cost of purchase.
The costs of providing these plans are recognised in the income statement over the period to which the employee has earned the award.
iii Long term service leave The Groups net obligation in respect of long term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
iv Other employee benefits The Group offers a number of discretionary bonus schemes to employees around the world.
The costs of these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward exchange contracts and swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
These are the only derivative financial instruments used by the Group.
In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue contracts for trading purposes.
Forward exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at fair value.
Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.

Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below.
i Critical accounting judgements Impairment of intangible assets The Group assesses the impairment of intangible assets subject to amortisation whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
Additionally, goodwill arising on acquisitions and indefinite lived assets are subject to impairment review.
The Group undertakes an impairment review annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate.
Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of uncertain matters, including managements expectations of growth in operating profit, long-term growth rates and appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.
Further explanations and sensitivities in respect of the current year impairment review are detailed in note 10. ii Key sources of estimation uncertainty Retirement benefits The Groups financial statements include costs in relation to, and provisions for, retirement benefit obligations.
Management is required to estimate the future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded.
Sensitivities to changes in key estimates affecting the pension schemes liabilities are shown in note 24.

Alternative performance measures The Group uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS, as management believe these measures facilitate greater comparison of the Groups underlying results with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
The key alternative performance measures that the Group use include adjusted profit measures and organic constant currency OCC.
Explanations of how they are calculated and how they are reconciled to IFRS statutory results are set out below.
Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit is the Groups operating profit excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and other items that are considered to be significant and where treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with additional useful information to assess the trading performance of the Group on a consistent basis.
In 2017, other items excluded are the release of contingent consideration, impairment of goodwill and restructuring costs to arrive at adjusted operating profit.
Further details on these adjustments are given in note 4. b.
Adjusted profit before tax The adjustments in calculating adjusted profit before tax are consistent with those in calculating adjusted operating profit above.

Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated using the adjusted net profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders and dividing it by the weighted average ordinary shares in issue see note 18.
Adjusted net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is calculated as follows: 2017 2016 Net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 55,613 67,173 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 27,183 26,811 Impairment of goodwill 21,594 Release of contingent consideration 10,000 Restructuring costs 5,413 Tax effect on adjusted items 7,879 7,035 Adjusted net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 91,924 86,949 Diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the adjusted net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and dividing it by the weighted average ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares see note 18. d.

Operating segments The Group has chosen to organise the management and financial structure by the grouping of related products.
The four identifiable operating segments for which the financial and operating performance is reviewed monthly by the chief operating decision maker are as follows: Controls the design, manufacture and sale of electric actuators.
Fluid Systems the design, manufacture and sale of pneumatic and hydraulic actuators.
Gears the design, manufacture and sale of gearboxes, adaption and ancillaries for the valve industry.
Instruments the manufacture of high precision pneumatic controls and power transmission products for a wide range of industries.
Unallocated expenses comprise corporate expenses.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Geographic analysis Rotork has a worldwide presence in all four operating segments through its subsidiary selling offices and through an agency network.

Adjustments to profit Adjustments are those items that management consider to be significant and where separate disclosure enables stakeholders to assess the trading performance of the Group on a consistent basis.
The adjustments to profit included in statutory profit are as follows: 2017 2016 Release of contingent consideration 10,000 Goodwill impairment 21,594 11,594 Restructuring costs 5,413 17,007 Bifold was acquired in 2015 and 10,000,000 of the consideration was contingent on a 2017 EBITDA performance target.
Given the target has not been met the contingent consideration has been released to the income statement.
As a result of the annual impairment review the goodwill associated with the Bifold and Tulsa CGUs has been impaired by 19,754,000 and 1,607,000 respectively.
Bifold has been impacted as a result of the downturn in its main oil and gas market and trading not recovering as quickly as anticipated.
The Tulsa CGU has also been impacted by depressed activity in the markets it serves.
Further details of the annual impairment review and the key assumptions is provided in note 10.
The restructuring costs include: i. Consultancy costs associated with the strategic review.
Redundancy costs which have arisen following the reorganisation of operations in Italy and Germany.
Executive termination and associated recruitment costs.
Within the income statement the goodwill impairment and restructuring costs are included in administrative expenses and the release of contingent consideration is included in other income.
The goodwill impairment is not tax deductible and the release of the contingent consideration is not taxable.
The restructuring costs are tax deductible in the country in which the expense is incurred.

The effective tax rate for the year is 31.0% 2016: 26.2%.
The adjusted effective tax rate is 26.3% 2016: 26.2% and is lower than the effective tax rate for the year principally because both the goodwill adjustments and the release of the contingent consideration are non-deductible for tax purposes.
The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on 22 December 2017, has resulted in a one off charge to tax of 1,162,000 arising on the revaluation of the Groups net US deferred tax assets at 31 December 2017.
Excluding the effect of this charge, the 2017 adjusted effective tax rate would be 25.4%.
The movement on the adjusted effective tax rate arising from the one off revaluation of the US net deferred tax asset has been offset by the change in the geographic mix of where profits are generated, resulting in a small increase in the adjusted effective tax rate from 26.2% to 26.3% in 2017.
The Group expects its adjusted effective tax rate to further fall next year as a result of the reduction in the US corporate tax rate, which comes into effect from 1 January 2018.
However, the adjusted effective tax rate will still remain higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in China, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork plc controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
The value of temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax has not been recognised is 305,277,000 2016: 282,541,000.

Goodwill 2017 2016 Cost At 1 January 251,407 222,086 Acquisition through business combinations 5,317 Other movements 255 Exchange adjustments 2,040 24,004 At 31 December 249,622 251,407 Provision for impairment At 1 January Impairment charge 21,594 At 31 December 21,594 Net book value 228,028 251,407 Cash generating units Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to the lowest level of cash generating unit CGU.
Where the acquired entitys growth into new markets is through the Groups existing sales network and or where manufacturing of certain products is transferred to other businesses within a division, the lowest level of CGU is considered to be at a divisional sub-group level.
During the year, following the merger of businesses in Italy, the CGUs of Masso and GTA were consolidated with the Rotork Fluid Systems CGU as this is the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The fall in oil price since 2015 has led to a sustained period of lower investment in the traditional HP upstream supply market which has had a substantial impact on the short to medium term forecasts for Bifold.
Given this uncertainty we have used an expected cash flow approach to determine the value in use of Bifold which has resulted in an impairment to Bifolds goodwill of 19,754,000.
In addition to the Bifold impairment, a further impairment charge of 1,607,000 has been recorded against the Tulsa CGU which has also been adversely affected by depressed activity in the oil and gas markets it serves.
The key assumptions used in the annual impairment review which are common to all other CGUs are set out below: i Discount rates The discount rates for the significant CGUs presented above are pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital WACC for each of the CGUs.
The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
ii Growth rates Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs.
These calculations use cash flow projections from management forecasts which are based on the budget and the three year plan.
The three year plan is a bottom up process which takes place as part of the annual budget process.
Once the budget for the next financial year is finalised, years two and three of the three year plan are prepared by each reporting entitys management reflecting their view of the local market, known projects and experience of past performance.
The Group annual budget and the three year plan are reviewed and approved by the Board each year.
In the period after the three year plan growth rates are forecast at 5% per annum for the next two years and at 2% for the long-term growth rate.
The 5% rate reflects a realistic market forecast for the flow control market up until 2022.
The continued need for our customers to improve their infrastructure by automating valves gives confidence that the growth rate of our market will exceed the long-term growth rate of 2% used in the impairment calculations.

Goodwill continued Sensitivity analysis At the balance sheet date, the estimated recoverable amount of the Bifold CGU is equal to its carrying value following the impairment charge noted above.
The key assumptions underpinning the estimate of the recoverable amount for the Bifold CGU are the discount rate and the forecast revenue growth rate for the next three years.
Considering each assumption change in isolation, an increase in the Bifold CGU discount rate by 1% would result in a further impairment of 10,400,000 and a decrease in the discount rate by 1% would result in a 13,600,000 lower impairment charge.
The weighted average revenue growth rate used in the Bifold impairment review is 11%.
If the forecast revenue growth in each of years one, two and three was reduced to 6%, this would result in a further impairment of 13,800,000.
If the forecast revenue growth in each of years one, two and three was increased to 16%, this would result in a reduction in the impairment charge of 15,100,000.
Each of these sensitivities are considered to be a reasonably possible change.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for the remaining CGUs to assess the impact of any reasonably possible change in assumptions.
Using the key assumptions above and applying sensitivities to these assumptions, there is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying amount of any other CGU goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.
The amortisation charge is recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.

Pension schemes i Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates two defined benefit pension arrangements the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme UK Scheme and the Rotork Controls Inc. Pension Plan US Pension Plan.
On retirement, leaving service or death, the Schemes provide benefits based on final salary and length of service.
The UK Scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met.
As part of the process the Company must agree with the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective and contributions to pay for future accrual of benefits.
The UK Scheme is managed by a Trustee, with directors appointed in part by the Group and part from elections by members of the Scheme.
The Trustee has responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Schemes assets.
The Trustee delegates some of these functions to its professional advisers where appropriate.
The UK Scheme which was closed to new entrants in 2003 will be closed to future accrual from 1 April 2018.
The US Pension Plan is subject to the ERISA funding requirements.
A valuation of the Plan is carried out annually to ensure the Funding Objective is met under ERISA by contributing at least the Minimum Required Contribution.
As part of this process the Company must contribute to the Plan enough contributions to ensure at least the Minimum Contribution is deposited in the Trust to pay for the accrual of benefits.
The two defined benefit pension arrangements expose the Group to a number of risks: Investment risk the Schemes hold investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long-term the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
The Schemes have a relatively balanced investment in equities, debt instruments and property.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the Trustees of the pension funds consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equities and in property to leverage the return generated by the funds.
Interest rate risk the Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Schemes hold assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the Schemes liabilities but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return of the Schemes debt investments.
Inflation risk a significant proportion of the benefits under the Schemes are linked to inflation.
Although the Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging.
Mortality risk in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Schemes.
There were no plan amendments, curtailments or settlements during the period.

For cash commutation, an allowance has been made for 90% of UK Scheme members who have yet to retire to take maximum cash at retirement.
The mortality assumptions used for the UK Scheme are the S2NXA year of birth tables 2016: S2NXA with future improvements in mortality based on the CMI 2016 projections 2016: CMI 2015 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum 2016: 1.25%.
By way of example the respective mortality tables indicate the following life expectancy: 2017 2016 Life expectancy at age 65 Life expectancy at age 65 Current age Male Female Male Female 65 22.2 24.2 22.3 24.4 45 23.6 25.7 24.0 26.3 Sensitivity analysis on the Schemes liabilities Adjustments to assumptions Approximate effect on liabilities Discount rate Plus 0.5% pa 24,000 Minus 0.5% pa 26,800 Inflation Plus 0.5% pa 12,700 Minus 0.5% pa 11,900 Salary increase Plus 0.5% pa 4,700 Minus 0.5% pa 4,400 Life expectancy Decrease mortality rates by a factor of 10% 7,300 Increase mortality rates by a factor of 10% 6,600 The above sensitivities are approximate and only show the likely effect of an assumption being adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same.
For the life expectancy sensitivity we have increased decreased the mortality rates by a factor of 10%.
Broadly speaking this decreases increases the assumed life expectancy by slightly less than one year.
The sensitivity analysis shown above was determined using the same method as per the calculation of liabilities for the balance sheet disclosures, but using assumptions adjusted as detailed above.
Effect of the Schemes on the Groups future cash flows The Group is required to agree a Schedule of Contributions with the Trustees of the UK Scheme following a valuation which must be carried out at least once every three years.
Following the valuation of the UK Scheme as at 31 March 2016, the Group is continuing to pay deficit contributions of 5,500,000 a year.
The Group estimates that cash contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes during 2018 will be 3,120,000 for regular payments 2017: 3,590,000 and 5,500,000 of additional payments in relation to past service 2017: 5,500,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 22 years.
ii Other pension plans The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for employees upon retirement.
Total expense relating to these plans in the year was 5,105,000 2016: 4,816,000.

For the 2015 and 2016 awards, half of these awards vest under a TSR performance condition and half under an EPS performance condition.
A Return on Invested Capital ROIC performance condition has been introduced in the 2017 LTIP award, details of which are shown in the 2016 Annual Report & Accounts.
A third of the awards vest under each performance condition.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares transferred will be determined by the number of shares initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
The actual number of shares transferred will be 25% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile.
For the 2015 awards, the EPS performance condition is satisfied with 15% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth is RPI 10% over the vesting period up to a maximum of 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds RPI 25%.
For the 2016 and 2017 awards, the EPS performance condition is satisfied with 15% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth is 9% over the vesting period up to a maximum of 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds35%.
Vesting of awards under the ROIC condition will be determined by calculating the growth in ROIC, on a cumulative basis, over the performance period.
For the 2017 awards, the awards will vest by comparing the average ROIC over the performance period against a set of pre-defined targets.
The performance period for the 2014 awards ended on 31 December 2016.
The TSR element of the award did not vest as the Company was in the 28th percentile relative to the comparator group.

Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The Treasury department maintains liquidity, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk, manages relations with the Groups bankers and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group Treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and cash on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering over 80% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set around this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group maintains an allowance for impairment in respect of non-insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material cash balance.
As well as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing and liquidity of funds.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2017 2016 Trade receivables 145,529 131,891 Other receivables 19,344 22,487 Cash and cash equivalents 63,192 61,423 Foreign exchange contracts 228,065 215,801 Other receivables consist principally of tax receivables and prepayments.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by currency was: Carrying amount 2017 2016 Sterling 19,646 17,488 US dollar 39,841 35,089 Euro 54,476 53,092 Other 31,566 26,222 145,529 131,891 Provisions against trade receivables The aging of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment at the reporting date was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2017 2017 2016 2016 Not past due 100,640 10 90,259 30 Past due 030 days 25,951 6 19,575 85 Past due 3160 days 10,012 81 11,480 58 Past due 6190 days 4,263 87 5,259 180 Past due more than 91 days 11,297 6,450 12,535 6,864 152,163 6,634 139,108 7,217 R RO OT TO OR RK A K AN NN NU UA AL R L RE EP PO OR RT 2 T 20 01 17 7 12 126 6 overview StrateGic report Governance Financial StatementS company inFormation b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses: it also maintains a 7m overdraft facility 2016: 7m on which interest would be payable at base rate plus 1.5%.
During 2017 the Group repaid its 20,000,000 committed 364 day facility that matured in August 2017.
In addition, the Group repaid 15,000,000 of its 90,000,000 term facility and negotiated to extend the remaining facility to August 2019.
The Group has a 60,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility which matures in August 2020.
At year end 75,000,000 of the committed facilities were drawn, resulting in 60,000,000 being available.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2017 amount cash flows 12 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 75,762 76,064 30,151 44,948 965 Finance lease liabilities 5 5 3 2 Trade and other payables 91,348 91,348 91,348 Contingent consideration 397 397 397 Foreign exchange contracts 1,766 1,766 1,521 245 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 169,318 169,620 123,420 45,195 965 40 Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2016 amount cash flows 12 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 116,299 116,792 65,349 44,989 5,657 797 Finance lease liabilities 72 74 71 3 Trade and other payables 81,651 81,651 81,651 Contingent consideration 11,708 11,708 1,708 10,000 Forward exchange contracts 10,626 10,626 8,143 2,483 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 220,396 220,891 156,922 57,475 5,657 837 Where a counterparty experiences credit stress then the foreign exchange contracts may be settled on a net basis but standard practice is to settle on a gross basis and the undiscounted gross outflow in respect of these contracts is 190,786,000 2016: 242,288,000 and the gross inflow is 189,127,000 2016: 231,888,000. c Market risk Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, and may affect the Groups results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the business units functional currency.
The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other non-sterling monetary assets and liabilities the exposures may also be hedged up to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
As part of the Groups cash management some of the overseas subsidiaries have loan and deposit balances where their intra-group counterparty is in the UK.
The balances are typically in local currency for the subsidiary so the UK holds a foreign currency current asset or liability which is usually hedged through the use of foreign exchange swaps.
At the balance sheet date only the forward part of the swap remains and this is designated as a cash flow hedge to match the currency exposure of the intercompany loan asset.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts that hedge both the forecast sale and purchase transactions and the intercompany loan and deposit balances as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2017 was a 1,702,000 asset 2016: 10,626,000 liability comprising an asset of 3,468,000 2016: nil and a liability of 1,766,000 2016: 10,626,000.
Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2017 mature in 2018 and 2019.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement.

Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Groups operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 300,000 2016: 250,000 and a change of one cent in the value of US dollar against sterling would have had an impact on the Groups operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 400,000 2016: 450,000.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2017 2016 2017 2016 US dollar 1.29 1.36 1.35 1.24 Euro 1.14 1.22 1.13 1.17 ii Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and the majority is available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three months.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling, US dollar, euro and renminbi deposits, all of which are on a floating rate basis.

All derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The other financial instruments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are valued as follows: i Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
ii Contingent consideration As all the contingent consideration is contractually due for payment within 12 months 2016: 14 months, the carrying amount is equal to the fair value.
Further information on the contingent consideration is shown in note 21.
