Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Segmental information The Group has determined its operating segments based on the management information including trading revenue and trading operating profit reviewed on a regular basis by the Companys board.
The Group considers the executive members of the Companys board to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The management information reviewed by the Companys board changed during the year due to the disposal of IGBB.
NEX now has two reportable segments: NEX Markets and NEX Optimisation.
NEX now also presents a NEX Group and other column, which includes the Groups remaining activities that do not meet the definition of reportable segments, and a Hedging impact column, which also does not meet the definition of a reportable segment.
The NEX Group and other column includes the activities of Shipping, Argentina, NEX Exchange, certain joint venture and associate investments and corporate costs.
The Hedging impact column shows the effect of hedging which is done centrally.
IFRS8 requires entities to present segmental information in the same way that the CODM reviews the information when directing resources and managing the business.
We believe that the new segmental disclosure achieves this more accurately.
Segmental information for the year ended 31 March 2016 has been restated due tothechange in accounting policy for operating segments and to be on a continuing operations basis.

Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
The Group also calculates trading EPS basic and diluted from the trading profit for the year.
The Group believes that this is the most appropriate measurement for assessing NEXs performance since it better reflects the businesss trading earnings.
The diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting share capital in issue for the additional weighted average number of ordinary shares that are likely to be issued under various employee share award schemes as at the balance sheet date.
As explained in the basis of preparation accounting policy, the Groups financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing group headed by ICAP plc.
As explained in note 26, the number of shares in 2016 17 changed significantly as a result of the share consolidation.
The 2016 17 weighted average number of shares has been stated as the weighted average number of shares in the period from the date of the share consolidation to the balancesheet date.
The 2015 16 weighted average number of shares has been restated as if the share consolidation had occurred at the beginning of the comparative year.

Dividends payable The Company recognises the final dividend payable only when it has been approved by the shareholders of the Company in a general meeting.
The interim dividend is recognised when the amount due has been paid.

The interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 was satisfied in full with a cash payment of 42m.
The interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 was paid to the shareholders of ICAP plc who were on the register at 9 December 2016.
The shares were quoted ex-dividend from 8 December 2016.
The directors have proposed a final dividend of 27.0p per share for the year ended 31 March 2017.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end, the total amount payable would be 100m.
Therefore, subject to shareholders approval of the proposed final dividend of 27.0p per share, including the interim dividend of 11.5p per share, the full-year dividend will be 38.5p per share.
The full-year dividend of 38.5p per share will be covered 1.1 times 2015 16: 1.1 times by the trading EPS basic from continuing and discontinued operations of 42.9p per share 2015 16: 43.4p per share.
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the shares held in employee share trusts.
The 2015 16 final dividend per share and the 2016 17 interim dividend per share have been restated on the basis that the share consolidation occurred at the beginning of the comparative year.
The proposed current year full-year dividend of 38.5p per share is equivalent to the full-year dividend disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016 of 22.0p per share on a pre-share consolidation basis.
Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is also included in other comprehensive income or directly within equity respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and intangibles arising on consolidation, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Calculations of current and deferred tax liability have been based on ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities, managements assessment of legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance.
Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were recorded initially, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.

These awards are delivered as a proportion of the annual bonus deferred into NEX Group plc shares for three years.
The awards do not have performance conditions but are subject to certain service conditions, malus and clawback.
The PSP is a long term incentive plan for the executive directors, GEMG members and certain other senior managers in the Group.
Recipients are granted anumber of NEX Group plc shares with a maximum award potential of 300% of salary.
These awards are subject to certain service and performance conditions, malus and clawback.
The LTIP is a long term incentive plan previously awarded to GEMG members and certain other senior managers in the Group.
The 2014 share awards consisted of basic and matching awards.
Under the basic awards, a certain percentage of the pre-tax bonus was deferred in NEX Group plc shares for three years with no performance conditions attached.
The matching awards equalled the basic awards but were subject to certain service and performance conditions.
The 2015 matching award was replaced with a PSP award.
Basic LTIP awards were last made to GEMG members in 2015 and to certain other senior managers in 2016.
From 2017 LTIP basic awards will be replaced with DSBP awards.
More information is provided in the remuneration report on pages 56 to 72.
The total charge to the discontinued income statement in respect of employee share awards in the year was 7m 2015 16: 2m.
The current year charge predominantly relates to an accelerated charge that was recognised on the disposal of IGBB.

The Groups objective is to minimise its interest cost and the impact of interest rate volatility on the Groups consolidated income statement.
In addition to debt, the Groups treasury policies also permit the use of derivatives including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps to meet these objectives.

Net finance expense continued Interest rate risk exposure continued At 31 March 2017, after taking into account the impact of the euro to pound sterling cross currency swaps, the interest rate profile of the Groups cash and debt from continuing operations was as follows: Year ended 31 March 2017 Year ended 31 March 2016 restated Floating rates Fixed rates Total Floating rates Fixed rates Total m m m m m m Continuing operations: Pound sterling Cash 202 202 23 23 Debt 330 330 110 321 431 Dollars and currencies closely related to the dollar Cash 70 70 98 98 Other currencies Cash 49 49 36 36 Debt 177 177 152 152 Total Cash 321 321 157 157 Debt 507 507 110 473 583 The Group has no floating debt other than the RCF, which was undrawn as at 31 March 2017.
A 100 basis-points parallel increase in Libor and Libid rates, which the Group considers to be an appropriate sensitivity measure, would decrease net finance costs by 2m in relation to pound sterling cash and by 1m in relation to dollar cash.
At 31 March 2016, 359m of cash and cash equivalents and 81m of debt were presented within held for sale assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
Net finance expense and interest rate risk exposure for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been restated to be on a continuing operations basis.
Company The Company is not exposed to interest rate movements since it does not hold variable rate cash or debt.
Borrowings Long-term borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of issuance costs incurred.
At subsequent reporting dates long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with changes in value recognised through the consolidated income statement.
Issuance costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.

Borrowings continued a Long-term borrowings continued The five-year senior notes are presented on the balance sheet at amortised cost, net of fees.
To enable the Group to manage the translational exposure which arises as a result of the notes being denominated in euros and to meet its risk management objective of minimising both interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on its consolidated income statement, the Group entered into a number of cross currency swaps to convert its obligations over the life of 250m of the notes from euros to pounds sterling at an FX rate of 1.21.
These swap from a fixed effective euro interest rate of 3.20% to a fixed pound sterling interest rate of 4.39%.
The swaps have been accounted for as a cash flow hedge and as at 31 March 2017 have a fair market value of 7m asset 2015 16: 7m liability and they offset the effect of FX on the notes.
The remaining 100m of the notes remain in euros and have been designated as a net investment hedge of the Groups euro-denominated net assets.
The Groups 300m RCF was undrawn as at 31 March 2017 2015 16: 110m drawn resulting in committed headroom of 300m 2015 16: 315m.
During the year, the RCFs maturity date was extended by one year to 31 March 2019.
The RCF incorporates a $200m swingline facility of which $75m is available as a late day fronted solution.
The weighted average effective interest rate for the year was 2.1% 2015 16: 2.2%.
The Groups bank facilities contain a number of customary financial and operational covenants.
Included in these, the Company is required to remain as the ultimate holding company in the Group.
The Group and Company remained in compliance with the terms of all its financial covenants throughout the year ended 31 March 2017.

Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are subject to insignificant risk of change in fair value and are readily convertible into a known amount of cash with less than three months maturity.
The Group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments, on behalf of clients client monies in accordance with local regulatory rules.
Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to clients.
Restricted funds comprise cash held with a CCP clearing house, or a financial institution providing NEX with access to a CCP, and funds set aside for regulatory purposes, but excluding client money.
The funds represent cash for which the Group does not have immediate and direct access or for which regulatory requirements restrict the use of the cash.

106 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors report Financial statements Definitions 13.
Capital and liquidity planning and management The Group does not seek to take proprietary market risk positions, so does not seek to expose its capital to market risk, and it does not undertake any form of maturity transformation so does not seek liquidity risk.
Thus the overall approach to the planning and management of the Groups capital and liquidity is to ensure the Groups solvency, i. e. its continued ability to conduct business, deliver returns to shareholders and support growth and strategic initiatives.
Liquidity Group The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as a result of trades executed as matched principal which result in margin and collateral requirements from clearing houses, clearing banks and as a result of regulatory rules stipulating the maintenance of certain liquidity buffers.
Such requirements can arise up until settlement which is typically only for a oneto five-day period.
Liquidity risk occurs primarily in BrokerTec US LLC which is required to deposit margins from time to time with the FICC and its clearing bank.
BrokerTec US LLC uses its funded cash together with access to the Groups $200m swingline facility to manage its liquidity requirements.
The liquidity requirements of the Group have decreased significantly following the disposal of IGBB.
The Group has a centralised approach to the provision of contingency funding for its trading entities.
Through the GFC, the board periodically reviews the liquidity demands of the Group and the financial resources available to meet these demands.
The GFC ensures that the Group, in totality and by subsidiary, has sufficient liquidity available in order to provide constant access, even in periods of market stress, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group had continuing gross debt of 507m 2015 16: 583m, the maturity analysis of which is set out in note 11, and continuing cash and cash equivalents of 321m 2015 16: 157m see note 12 c. Cash held at clearing houses, or a financial institution providing NEX with access to a CCP to which the Group has no immediate access in practice, is disclosed as restricted funds in the financial statements note 12 e. The Group invests its cash balances in a range of capital protected instruments including money market deposits, AAA-rated liquidity funds and government bonds with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to counterparty credit risk and liquidity.
With the exception of some small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong institutions holding investment grade ratings.
Company The Companys policy is to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of liquidity to enable it to finance its forecast ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
If the Company has any cash, it is loaned intra-Group for further investment.
Capital management The Groups capital strategy is to maintain an efficient and strong capital base which maximises the return to its shareholders, while also maintaining flexibility.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt note 11 and equity, including share capital note 26, share premium, other reserves note 27 and retained earnings.
The Group seeks to ensure that it has sufficient regulatory capital in each of its eight regulated entities to meet local regulatory requirements.
As none of the regulated companies in the Group take proprietary positions they do not have an inventory of assets so regulatory capital is mostly covered by cash.
In general, higher levels of market volatility can result in increased demand for the Groups services.
As the capital requirements in the Groups regulated entities are, however, driven predominantly by the fixed cost base, the impact of changes in volumes on the capital requirement is significantly dampened.
As such, absent a material acquisition, existing capital resources are viewed as sufficient to operate and to continue to invest in the development of the Groups businesses.

Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Development expenditure on software is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 Intangible Assets.
Capitalised expenditure is recognised initially at cost and is presented subsequently at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five years.
The Group reviews the useful economic lives of these assets on a regular basis.
Development costs are incurred and capitalised when a final development plan including the specifics of the assets to be developed is signed off by a committee with appropriate delegated authority including business management boards.
As part of the approval process, the committee considers the commercial viability and technological feasibility of bringing the asset into use.
When a project is abandoned in the development phase, costs are charged to the income statement.
Prior to this stage, costs incurred in the research phase, including undertaking feasibility studies, are recorded in the income statement.
Once an internally generated software asset is brought into use, any ongoing related costs are charged to the income statement to the extent that they relate to ongoing maintenance of the asset.
Where any costs are identified by an appropriately authorised management committee to be an enhancement to the original asset, these costs are capitalised and amortised over the remaining expected useful life of the asset.
The Group has an internal threshold for capitalisation of 5,000 for individual assets and 125,000 for software-related projects.
The key component of the development costs is compensation of employees.
Each of the Groups businesses and the Groups infrastructure area have their own dedicated IT project development teams.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses.
Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.

Intangible assets arising on consolidation Since 1 April 2004, intangible assets arising on consolidation include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets such as client relationships and client contracts that arose on business combinations.
The amortisation and any impairment is included in the consolidated income statement within the column Acquisition and disposal costs.
The Group reviews the performance of the acquired businesses and reassesses the period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to generate cash flows that exceed the carrying value.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries when the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree exceeds the amount of the identifiable net assets acquired.
If the amount ofthe identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is greater, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of investments in joint ventures when the cost of investment exceeds NEXs share of the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is included in Investments in joint ventures and is not tested separately for impairment.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of interests in associates when the cost of investment exceeds NEXs share of the net fair value of the associates identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included in Interests in associates and is not tested separately for impairment.
Where the Group makes an acquisition and the balances are reported as provisional at the year end, the Group has a measurement period of up to 12months from the date of acquisition to finalise the provisional amounts where new information becomes available about facts and circumstances thatexisted at the balance sheet date, which could impact the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising on consolidation.
The measurement period ends as soon as the information required is received.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
ii Separately identifiable intangible assets The Group has recognised separately identified intangible assets on acquisitions where appropriate.
These generally include client contracts and client relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated initially at fair value and are adjusted subsequently for amortisation and any impairment.
Amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation are recognised in the second column of the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment has taken place, the asset is reviewed annually for any reversal of the impairment.
Any reversals of impairment are credited to the consolidated income statement.
All separately identifiable intangible assets have a finite life excluding goodwill.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Client relationships 2 10 years Client contracts Period of contract Other intangible assets Period of contract A deferred tax liability is recognised against the asset for which the amortisation is non-tax deductible.
The liability unwinds over the same period as the asset is amortised.
iii Impairment Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indicator of impairment.
Goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation are allocated to a cash generating unit CGU at acquisition for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The identification of CGUs is reviewed where there is a significant change to the Groups segmental reporting structure.
Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of a CGU is based on the assets and liabilities of each CGU, including attributable goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use VIU.
VIU is the present value of the expected future cash flows from a CGU.
Where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its VIU, an impairment charge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, and the asset is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
For goodwill, impairment charges previously recognised are not reversed and impaired intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previously recognised impairment.
This process requires the exercise of significant judgement by management: if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.

The pre-tax discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital WACC NEX allocates to investments in the businesses within which the CGU operates.
A long-term growth rate estimate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term nature of the businesses in the CGUs.
The Groups WACC is a function of the Groups cost of equity, derived using a Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM, and the Groups cost of debt.
The cost of equity estimate depended on inputs in the CAPM reflecting a number of variables including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated.
These inputs are based on the markets assessment of economic variables and management judgement, which are subject to scrutiny by the GFC and the Audit Committee see page 45.
All inputs to the CAPM were externally sourced.
The CGU-specific WACCs were then derived by adjusting the Group WACC for business-specific risk factors.
Nominal long-term growth rate The growth rate reflects weighted average real GDP growth and inflation for the countries within which the CGUs operate.
The rates are based on the International Monetary Funds medium-term forecasts as they are deemed to be reliable estimates of likely future trends.
The rates applied do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy or, for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global GDP.
Managements judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU The cash flow projections for each CGU are based on plans approved by the board.
For the 2016 17 annual impairment testing of Abide Financial, ENSO and Traiana, managements cash flow projections for the three years ending 31 March 2020 were used.
For all other CGUs, management cash flow projections for the year ending 31 March 2018 were used.

Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued b Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date and having assessed sensitivities of the key assumptions, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of those key assumptions noted above would not cause an impairment in any of the CGUs.
Provisions A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, either legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable there will be a transfer of economic benefits to settle the obligation.
A provision is recognised only where a reliable estimate can be made of the value of the obligation.

Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees The Groups contingent liabilities include possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of NEX.
Additionally, contingent liabilities also include present obligations that have arisen from past events but are not recognised because it is not probable that settlement will require the outflow of economic benefits, or because the amount of the obligations cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of the outflow of the Groups economic resources is remote.
Judgements applied in concluding the appropriateness of contingent liabilities disclosure are confirmed after consultation with external counsel and discussion with the Audit Committee.
Contingent liabilities The Company and its subsidiaries continue to co-operate with the government agencies in Europe and the US relating to their investigations into the setting of yen Libor.
ICAP plc was dismissed from initial US civil litigation against various yen Libor and euroyen Tibor setting banks.
However, the plaintiff in that litigation was given permission by the court to add ICAP Europe Limited IEL which was sold to TP ICAP as a defendant, and an amended complaint doing so was filed on 29 February 2016.
IEL filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on 16 May 2016 and, following briefing on the motion, oral argument took place on 25 October 2016.
On 10 March 2017, the court granted IELs motion, and IEL has been dismissed from the lawsuit.
It is unclear whether plaintiffs will appeal the courts decision.
On 24 July 2015, a new litigation was filed on behalf of two additional plaintiffs in the same court based on similar allegations.
The new litigation includes claims against ICAP plc and IEL, both of which have filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and have joined co-defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
Oral argument on these motions was heard on 5 May 2016, and on 10 March 2017, the court granted ICAP plcs and IELs motions, thus dismissing both parties from the lawsuit.
On 3 April 2017, plaintiffs filed a notice to commence the appeal process.
Plaintiffs in the Euribor civil litigation named ICAP plc and IEL on 13 August 2015 as parties to that pre-existing litigation.
ICAP plc and IEL have joined the other defendants in filing motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.
On 21 February 2017, the court granted ICAP plcs and IELs motions to dismiss in the Euribor case.
Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint, which the court denied.
Barring an appeal or other application by plaintiffs, both parties remain out of the case.
It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries or the litigations and it is not possible to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group.

Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees continued Contingent liabilities continued The Group continues to co-operate with inquiries by the US government agencies into the setting of USD ISDAFIX rates.
In 2014, civil lawsuits were filed in the US against USD ISDAFIX setting banks, where a subsidiary of the Company was originally named, but was subsequently replaced by ICAP Capital Markets LLC ICM, as a defendant.
Those suits have now been consolidated into a single action, which is in the discovery stage.
ICM intends to defend these litigation claims vigorously.
It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries or the litigation and it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group.
From 25 November 2015 through present, ICM has been named as a defendant, along with a number of banks and Tradeweb Markets LLC, in ten civil lawsuits relating to the interest rates swaps market.
Eight of the lawsuits are class actions by alleged investors in the market, and the other two are single plaintiff cases brought by failed competitors.
All of the suits make allegations that defendants together colluded to prevent buy side clients from accessing the interest rates swaps market on electronic, exchange-like platforms, including the boycott of any platform offering all-to-all trading.
The actions generally assert claims of violation of antitrust laws and unjust enrichment.
The cases have been consolidated and are being managed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Defendants intend to file a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
The consolidated litigation is in the early case management stage, and all defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim on 4 November 2016.
Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint which, among other things, added ICAP SEF US LLC and ICAP Global Derivatives Limited both of which were sold to TP ICAP as defendants.
All defendants filed new motions to dismiss on 29 January 2017.
The motions have been fully briefed and oral argument is presently scheduled for 2 May 2017, pending a request by defendants for a two to four week adjournment of such date.
It is not possible to predict the outcome of these litigations or to provide an estimate of any potential liability or financial impact on the Group.
On 16 August 2016, ICAP plc and ICAP Australia Pty Limited which was sold to TP ICAP, along with a number of banks and two TP ICAP group entities, were named as defendants in a purported class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, and common law claims arising out of the alleged manipulation of the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate BBSW, which plaintiffs contend harmed a class of individuals and entities that traded in the US in instruments priced, benchmarked and or settled based on BBSW between 1 January 2003 and some indeterminate later time.
ICAP plc and ICAP Australia Pty Limited accepted service while preserving the right to challenge the courts exercise of personal jurisdiction over the entities.
Both defendants, along with other defendants in the case, filed motions to dismiss on 24 February 2017.
Plaintiffs opposition is due 28 April 2017, and defendants reply papers are due 25 May 2017.
It is not possible to predict the outcome of this litigation or to provide an estimate of any potential liability or financial impact on the Group.
From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation in relation to a variety of matters, and is also required to provide information to regulators and other government agencies as part of informal and formal inquiries or market reviews.
For the sake of clarity, some of the matters described herein may not be the direct responsibility of the Group but may be its responsibility under indemnification and or breach of warranty provisions agreed to by the Group with TP ICAP.
The sale by ICAP plc of its global broking business to TP ICAP entailed customary warranties given by ICAP plc in the sale and purchase agreement and repeated at completion of the Transaction.
Warranty claims are subject to customary limitations, including a fide minimis and aggregate claims threshold, a cap, and time limits for bringing a claim.
In addition to such warranties, ICAP plc also provided TP ICAP with indemnities for, among other things, certain known regulatory, litigation and employment claims.
It is not possible to predict whether any of the matters described herein will give rise to liabilities under the warranties and or indemnities given in connection with the Transaction.
Details of regulatory and other matters that have a provision recognised for them are detailed in note 16.
Contractual commitments Operating lease commitments At the end of the financial year, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases which fall due as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2017 2016 m m Within one year 18 24 Between one and five years 45 53 After five years 5 11 68 88 Operating lease commitments relate to the rental of premises for office space in Asia Pacific, Sweden, the UK and the US.
The operating lease commitments include onerous lease provisions before estimated receipts under non-cancellable subleases.
The operating lease commitments as at 31 March 2016 include commitments that have since transferred to TP ICAP.
Guarantees In the normal course of business certain Group companies enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover clearing and settlement arrangements and or the use of third party services software.
It is not possible to quantify the extent of any potential liabilities, but there are none currently expected to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated results or net assets.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group has given 1,024m 2015 16: 404m of guarantees to counterparties.
NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 113 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 18.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently reviewed for recoverability.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision for doubtful debt, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within Operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against Operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or determinable value.
They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in their value.
Fair value through profit or loss assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are recognised initially at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
The accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is included in note 28.
Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity as principal in the commitment to purchase and sell securities and other financial instruments through two or more transactions between our clients.
Substantially all matched principal receivables and payables note 19 settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of the trade date.
The Group previously applied trade date accounting but the Group has changed its accounting policy in the year to recognise matched principal receivables and payables at the settlement date.
Settlement date accounting provides more reliable and relevant information due to the change in the Groups principal business activities after the completion of the Transaction.
Matched principal trade receivables and payables as at 31 March 2016 have been restated as a result of the change in accounting policy.
Financial instruments not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the value may be impaired.
The amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously impaired are credited to the consolidated income statement.

a Credit risk management The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its matched principal, exchange-traded and corporate treasury operations.
The Group does not bear any significant concentration risk to either counterparties or markets.
The credit risk in respect of the NEX Markets excluding the matched principal business and the NEX Optimisation businesses is limited to the collection of outstanding transaction fees and this is managed proactively by the Groups accounts receivable function with oversight from the independent credit risk function.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which are undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis.
114 NEX Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report Governance and directors report Financial statements Definitions 18.
Trade and other receivables continued a Credit risk management continued The Group manages its credit risk in these transactions through appropriate policies and procedures in order to mitigate this risk including on-boarding requirements, setting appropriate credit limits for all counterparties which are closely monitored by the credit risk team to restrict any potential loss through counterparty default.
The Groups matched principal counterparty exposure at any given point throughout the year is split between investment grade counterparts rated BBBBaa3 or above and sub-investment grade counterparts rated BB Ba1 or lower.
The Groups potential stressed counterparty credit risk is less than 5% of the Groups total capital resources.
The credit risk on core cash, cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is monitored on a daily basis.
All financial institutions that are transacted with for borrowings and deposits are approved by the GFC and internal limits are assigned to each one based on a combination of factors including external credit ratings.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents are deposited with investment grade-rated financial institutions.
Company The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
This risk is considered minimal as all counterparties are Group companies and the risk of non-payment is viewed as low.
b Impairment of other trade receivables Other trade receivables represent amounts receivable in respect of agency business and information services.
All receivables are individually assessed for impairment at the reporting date.
Management judgement is applied in determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred and, if so, the measurement of the impairment allowance.
In determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred, judgement is exercised in evaluating all relevant information on indicators of impairment, which is not restricted to the consideration of whether payments are contractually past due but includes broader consideration of factors indicating deterioration in the financial condition and outlook of clients affecting their ability to pay.
For those receivables where objective evidence of impairment exists, management determines the size of the allowance required based on a range of factors including probability of default and, if defaulted, expectation of recovery.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed and the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
As at 31 March 2017, nil of continuing other trade receivables remain impaired 2015 16: 1m.
There have been no new impairments during the year.
Past due but not impaired trade and other receivables are those in respect of which the debtor has failed to make a payment or a partial payment in accordance with the contractual terms of the invoice, but there is no major concern over the credit-worthiness of the counterparty, therefore they are not impaired.
In the prior reporting periods, receivables past a normal settlement date were considered past due and were reported on that basis.
As at 31 March 2017 the following continuing other trade receivables were past due but not impaired.

Investments in joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment under IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Whenever application of IAS39 indicates that an investment may be impaired, the carrying amount of the investment, including attributed goodwill, is tested for impairment as a single asset under IAS36, by comparing the carrying amount with its recoverable amount the higher of VIU and fair value less costs to sale.

Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are debt and equity non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value.
Available-for-sale investments in equity assets that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured, are subsequently recorded at cost less impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on such financial assets, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
All other available-for-sale financial assets are fair valued subsequently at each period end.
Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement for an investment in an available-for-sale equity instrument are not reversed through the consolidated income statement.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity investments are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
When an available-for-sale financial asset is derecognised, any cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised previously in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets.
Assets such as shares or seats in exchanges, cash-related instruments, and long-term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures, are classified as available-for-sale.

The capital redemption reserve was created as a result of shares cancelled in 1998 and 2005.
The capital redemption reserve is a legal reserve relating to the previous parent of the Group, ICAP plc, and therefore has been derecognised due to the legal change in ownership of the Group to NEX Group plc.
The revaluation reserve represents revaluations of available-for-sale investments.
The hedging reserve arises from fair value movements of derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges on the balance sheet.

Currency risk management The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to FX and interest rate movements.
These can include forward FX contracts, currency options and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs.
Where derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, along with transaction costs.
Where they do qualify, gains and losses are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments are determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including discounted cash flow analysis, as no active markets with quoted prices exist for the instruments held by the Group.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be documented clearly at inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and, if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the accounting for the hedge relationship is terminated.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk that could affect the consolidated income statement.
The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its fair value being taken through the consolidated income statement.
For periods in which the hedge is shown to be effective, the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses relating to the hedging instrument that had previously been recognised directly in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity remains there and is recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is transferred immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign-denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedging instrument, whether it is a derivative financial instrument or a recognised asset or liability on the balance sheet, is consistent with the aforementioned treatment for a cash flow hedge.
Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign-denominated investment.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Group The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in pound sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the dollar.
Consequently the Group both continuing and discontinued operations is exposed to FX risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenue and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its non-pound sterling operations.
a Transactional exposures The Groups policy is for all subsidiaries to hedge their material non-functional currency transactional exposures through a combination of forward FX contracts and options for up to two years forward.
Under this policy, a minimum of 75% of the forecast exposures are hedged for the first six months, 50% for the following six months and 25% for the next six months.
The majority of these exposures relate to dollar sales arising in pound sterling functional currency companies.
The table below sets out the Groups outstanding forward FX contracts as at 31 March 2017 which are designated as cash flow hedges.

Currency risk management continued b Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local consolidated balance sheet may contain monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
Where material, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of these exposures using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation as a result of the retranslation of the balance sheet of the Groups non-pound sterling operations, principally dollar and euro, into pounds sterling, the Groups presentational currency.
The Groups general policy is not to actively manage these exposures, as active management using instruments with a shorter tenure than the underlying net asset can give rise to a net cash outflow.
However, from time to time it will use forward FX contracts, cross currency swaps or non-pound sterling denominated borrowings to mitigate these exposures.
As at 31 March 2017 the Group has $235m of forward FX contracts, 100m of the 2019 five-year senior notes and the 15m 2023 ten-year senior notes, designated as hedging instruments against the underlying dollar and euro exposures respectively.
As at 31 March 2017 these exposures were $1.2bn 2015 16: $1.4bn and 0.1bn 2015 16: 0.2bn including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.2bn 2015 16: $0.2bn and 0.1bn 2015 16: 0.1bn of hedging.
The table below shows the actual impact on the Groups equity of movements in the dollar and euro exchange rates due to transactional and translational exposures.
The table below also discloses the anticipated impact on the Groups equity of a 10 cent weakening, which the Group considers to be an appropriate sensitivity measure, in the dollar and euro in terms of transactional and translational exposure.

These include the use of forward FX contracts to hedge a portion of its transactional dollar and euro exposures and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the FX and interest rate risks on its senior notes.
Where these are designated and documented as cash flow hedges in the context of IAS39 and are demonstrated to be effective, mark-to-market gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and transferred to the consolidated income statement on derecognition of the underlying item being hedged.

Company d Balance sheet translational exposures The Company is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures where the balance sheet contains financial assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling.
While it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of these exposures at Group level, at Company level these exposures can affect the Companys profit after tax.
At 31 March 2017, the Company had no financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 2015 16: nil.
