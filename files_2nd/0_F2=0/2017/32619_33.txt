Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 17 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 29 January 2017 6 Capital and borrowings 6.1 Accounting policies Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, any difference between the redemption value and the initial carrying amount is recognised in profit for the period over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the Groups profit for the period on an effective interest rate basis except for interest costs that are directly attributable to the construction of buildings and other qualifying assets, which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of the asset.
Capitalisation commences when both expenditure on the asset and borrowing costs are being incurred, and necessary activities to prepare the asset for use are in progress.
In the case of new stores, this is generally once planning permission has been obtained.
Capitalisation ceases when the asset is ready for use.
Interest is capitalised at the effective rate incurred on borrowings before taxation of 5% 2016: 5%.
Capitalised interest is included within interest paid in cash flow from operating activities.
Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases: all other leases are classified as finance leases.
Property leases are analysed into separate components for land and buildings and tested to establish whether the components are operating leases or finance leases.
Rental payments on operating leases in which the Group is lessee are taken to profit for the period on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Sale and leaseback of properties The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends upon the substance of the transaction by applying the lease classification principles described above.
For sale and operating leasebacks, the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the Statement of comprehensive income.
When forming the conclusion of operating lease classification, consideration was given to the key lease classification indicators of IAS 17.
The leases are typically for a 25 year period.
The Directors have reviewed the remaining useful lives for these particular properties and concluded they are significantly longer than the period of the lease.
As disclosed on page 78 a review of the useful economic lives of each of the property, plant and equipment categories has been performed in the year with no changes made.
Other key indicators considered in reaching an operating lease classification were the present value of the minimum lease payments and the ownership clauses in the contracts upon expiry of the lease.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from retained earnings until the shares are cancelled.
On cancellation, the nominal value of the shares is deducted from share capital and the amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.
Own shares held The Group has employee trusts for the granting of Group shares to executives and members of the employee share plans.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trusts are presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from retained earnings.
The shares are deducted for the purpose of calculating the Groups earnings per share.
Net debt Net debt is cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit, bank and other current loans, bonds, private placement loan notes and derivative financial instruments stated at current fair value.

In September 2016 the Group extended its syndicated committed revolving credit facility of 1.35bn by a further year, resetting its five year term and resulting in a maturity date of September 2021.
The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees and drawdowns bear interest at floating interest rates at a spread above LIBOR.
There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the balance sheet date.
In the year, the Group did not renew a further credit facility of 150m that was in place during 2016.
Therefore the Group had 1.35bn of undrawn committed borrowing facilities available 2016: 1.5bn.
In the event of default of covenants the principal amounts of borrowings and any interest accrued become repayable on demand.
Maturity of borrowings The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups borrowings based on contractual, undiscounted payments, which include interest payments.
As a result, amounts shown below do not agree to the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings.
Creditors note 5.4 are excluded from this analysis.

The fair value of the USPP at 2016 was estimated by comparing the interest rate to market rates available to the Group at the balance sheet date level 2.
The fair values of borrowings included in level 2 are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debts on similar terms, credit risk and equivalent maturity dates.
These compare to carrying values as follows: 2017 2016 Amortised Fair Amortised Fair cost value cost value m m m m Total bonds: non-current and current 1,550 1,676 2,034 2,019 Total loan notes: non-current 174 167 1,550 1,676 2,208 2,186 The fair value of other items within current and non-current borrowing equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not material.

In March 2016, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an agenda decision regarding the treatment of offsetting and cash-pooling arrangements in accordance with IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation.
This provided additional guidance on when bank overdrafts in cash-pooling arrangements would meet the requirements for offsetting in accordance with IAS 32.
Following this additional guidance, the Group has reviewed its cash-pooling arrangements and recognised nil of cash-pooling facilities within bank overdrafts and short term borrowings in the current period that would previously have been offset against cash and cash equivalent balances.
Comparatives at 31 January 2016 have been restated by 8m.
There is no impact of this change in presentation on cash flows or net debt.

Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the reserve in the Companys balance sheet arising on the acquisition in 2004 of Safeway Limited.
In the opinion of the Directors, this reserve is not distributable and accordingly it will be carried forward as a capital reserve.
Hedging reserve This represents the gains and losses arising on derivatives used for cash flow hedging.
6.7 Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity and net debt balances, as well as its lease commitments.
The Groups capital management objectives are to safeguard its viability taking into consideration the risks that it faces whilst maintaining an investment grade credit rating and having adequate liquidity headroom.
The Group manages its capital structure by managing the balance of debt and shares outstanding.
It does this by seeking an effective balance between debt and equity.
During the current financial year, net debt has reduced by 552m, reflecting strong operating cash flow driven by working capital management and property and business disposals.
Throughout the year, the Group has comfortably complied with the gearing and fixed charge cover covenants attaching to its revolving credit facility.
