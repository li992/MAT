com 1 111 11 Notes to the accounts continued 12 DISCONTINUED OPERATION On 7 April 2017, the Group completed the sale of Venues, its exhibition business, comprising Olympia London together with certain related property assets for a total gross cash consideration of 296.0 million.
The disposal was in line with the Group strategy following the successful transition of shows from the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres to Olympia.
After the repayment of debt, working capital adjustments and transaction related costs, net proceeds received were 230.2 million.
Based on the net assets at the date of disposal a profit has been recognised on the sale of 2.1 million.
As part of the sale, the defined benefit scheme the Group previous held was sold to the purchaser and therefore the Group has no outstanding liability in relation to the scheme.
The net assets at the date of disposal were as follows: 7 April 2017 m Investment and development property 292.8 Other non-current assets 0.8 Pension asset 1.4 1 Cash and cash equivalents 10.8 Other current assets 8.9 Other current liabilities 15.9 Deferred tax 15.7 Borrowings 55.0 Net assets 228.1 2 Net consideration 230.2 Profit on disposal 2.1 1 Cash and cash equivalents include 6.0 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents.
2 Sale of discontinued operation as per the consolidated statement of cash flows as at 31 December 2017 is 226.0 million.
This differs to the net consideration above of 230.2 million by 4.2 million.
This is due to accrued transaction costs of 0.6 million less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents disposed of with the transaction of 4.8 million.

com 1 117 17 Notes to the accounts continued 15 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED At 31 December 2017, the Group was contractually committed to 57.3 million 2016: 149.2 million of future expenditure for the purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property.
Refer to note 29 Capital Commitments for further information on capital commitments.
The fair value of the Groups investment, development and trading property at 31 December 2017 was determined by independent, appropriately qualified external valuers, JLL for Earls Court Properties excluding the Empress State Building and 15-17 Long Acre and CBRE Ltd for the remainder of the Groups property portfolio.
The valuations conform to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.
Each year the Executive Directors, on behalf of the Board, appoint the external valuers.
The valuers are selected based upon their knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group.
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Groups portfolio.
At each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs.
Valuers submit and present summary reports to the Groups Audit Committee, with the Executive Directors reporting to the Board on the outcome of each valuation round.
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition.
The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs including any site specific costs for example Section 106, professional fees, planning fees, developers profit including contingencies, planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development.
As at 31 December 2017 all Covent Garden properties are valued under the income capitalisation technique.
The majority of Earls Court properties are valued under the residual development approach.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer will consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change in arriving at its valuation.
A number of the Groups properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon assumptions of capital values, rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the development.
Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developers profit, before arriving at a valuation.
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties, the Empress State Building has been valued on the basis of its development potential as a residential-led scheme.
The property is currently used as an office space, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to achieve the change in use is being implemented.
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets.
The most significant of these occur when planning permission is required or when a credit facility is in place.
These restrictions are factored into the propertys valuation by the external valuer.
Refer to disclosures surrounding property risks on page 19.
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group, are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13.
Trading property is exempt from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements.
The different valuation levels are defined as: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets: Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices: and Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between fair value levels is deemed to have occurred.
Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from Level 3 to Level 2.
All investment and development properties held by the Group are classified as Level 3.
As at 31 December 2016, 178.5 million of Covent Garden investment and development properties were valued using the residual development method valuation technique.
As at 31 December 2017, these properties have been valued using the income capitalisation valuation technique as the developments have completed or are substantially complete.

Construction costs including site specific costs expressed per square foot on a gross external area basis.
For properties valued under the income capitalisation method, if all other factors remained equal, an increase in estimated rental value of five per cent would result in an increased asset valuation of 119.5 million 2016: 111.8 million.
A decrease in the estimated rental value of five per cent would result in a decreased asset value of 115.8 million 2016: 108.7 million.
Conversely, an increased equivalent yield of 25 basis points would result in a decreased asset valuation of 174.3 million 2016: 159.8 million.
A decreased equivalent yield of 25 basis points would result in an increased asset valuation of 199.4 million 2016: 182.9 million.
These inputs are interdependent, partially determined by market conditions.
The impact on the valuation could be mitigated by the interrelationship between the two inputs.
An increase in estimated rental value occurring in conjunction with an increase in equivalent yield could result in no net impact to the valuation.
For properties valued under the residual development method, an increase in the estimated construction costs of 10 per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 224.5 million 2016: 238.1 million and a decrease of 10 per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuation of 225.1 million 2016: 239.4 million.
An increase in the developers profit of one percentage point would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 24.8 million 2016: 27.8 million and a decrease of one percentage point would result in an increase in the asset valuation of 24.8 million 2016: 28.6 million.
An increased finance rate of 25 basis points would result in a decreased asset valuation of 25.2 million 2016: 26.3 million and a decrease of 25 basis points would result in an increased asset valuation of 25.0 million 2016: 26.6 million.
Conversely, an increase in the capital value per square foot of five per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuation of 144.8 million 2016: 158.1 million and a decrease of five per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 145.8 million 2016: 156.4 million.
The above inputs are interdependent, partially determined by market conditions.
The impact on the valuation could be mitigated by the interrelationship between these inputs.
An increase in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 0.2 million 2016: 22.4 million.
A decrease in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuation of 0.2 million 2016: 38.4 million.

The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
126 126 Capco Capco Annual R Annual Re eport & port & Accounts 2017 Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives.
Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
Interest rate caps protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the caps ceiling.
Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the collars ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn external borrowings profile of the Group and joint ventures.
The table is calculated on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
Fixed Capped Floating Fixed Capped Floating 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m 1 Nominal value of Group borrowings excluding finance leases 550.0 227.1 325.0 517.9 Nominal value of joint venture borrowings excluding finance leases 31.9 77.6 Nominal value of non-controlling interest borrowings excluding finance leases 23.0 12.0 550.0 236.0 325.0 583.5 Derivative impact nominal value of derivative contracts 165.0 165.0 455.9 455.9 Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 715.0 71.0 780.9 127.6 Interest rate protection 91% 86% 1 Excludes current loan notes of nil 2016: 6.0 million to which the Group has no interest rate exposure under the terms of the borrowing.
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is greater than 25 per cent.
In 2016, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows arising on 60.0 million of outstanding debt from 2016 to 2026.
The loss recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was nil 2016: 1.2 million.
This loss will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the term of the designated debt.
The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2017 is nil 2016: nil.
The hedge was 100 per cent effective: therefore no charge for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement.
The sensitivity analysis below illustrates the impact of a 50 basis point bps shift, upwards and downwards, in the level of interest rates on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Increase in Decrease in Increase in Decrease in interest rates interest rates interest rates interest rates by 50 bps by 50 bps by 50 bps by 50 bps 2017 2017 2016 2016 m m m m Effect on profit before tax change in fair value of derivative financial instruments : Increase decrease 6.6 6.6 10.4 10.4 The sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents managements assessment of possible changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, therefore such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commitments.
The Groups policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed and undrawn facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entitys ability to meet the relevant facilitys financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired refinancing.
The tables overleaf set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, amounts receivable from joint ventures, loan notes and cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account the value of any deposits or guarantees obtained.
Trade and other receivables: Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Trade receivables are less than one per cent of total assets at 31 December 2017 2016: less than one per cent.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2017 was 13.6 million 2016: 7.8 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
Specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: Group Group 2017 2016 m m Up to 90 days 3.2 7.3 Over 90 days 0.1 0.6 Trade receivables 3.3 7.9 In 2017 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of 0.5 million 2016: write down of 0.6 million.
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk.
However, this is mitigated by the extensive range of tenants from varying business sectors and the credit review process as noted above.
128 128 Capco Capco Annual R Annual Re eport & port & Accounts 2017 Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Amounts receivable from joint ventures: Included within receivables is nil 2016: 7.0 million of amounts advanced to LSJV.
The carrying value of the investment in LSJV is nil 2016: nil as the Groups share of losses exceeds the cost of its investment.
Total funding advanced to LSJV, including the deep discount bonds, of 147.5 million 2016: 150.9 million has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable to the joint venture by 47.6 million 2016: 46.3 million.
LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
However, based on a market valuation undertaken by the Groups valuers JLL, there is an unrecognised surplus of 31.8 million Group share as at 31 December 2017.
This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when significant risks and rewards have transferred to the buyer.
Therefore, while Lillie Square demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed to be at risk of default, for reporting purposes the Group is required to allocate losses against amounts advanced to LSJV, to the extent that losses do not exceed the investment, until the unrecognised surplus on trading property is realised through sale.
Cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments: The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties.
The maximum exposure to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2017 amounted to 28.6 million 2016: 31.1 million.
Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and other financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the loan to value ratio LTV and the interest cover ratio.
The Group aims not to exceed an underlying LTV ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent.
These ratios are disclosed on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
These metrics are discussed in the Financial Review on page 40.

Fair value estimation Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13.
The tables below present the Groups financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.

The fair values of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are not materially different from those at which they are carried in the financial statements.
com 1 129 29 Notes to the accounts continued 27 DEFERRED TAX The decrease in corporation tax rate referred to in note 11 Taxation has been enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 12 and therefore has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing of the realisation of deferred tax.
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the properties original tax base cost.
Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Groups holding structure.
The Groups recognised deferred tax position on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is nil at 31 December 2017 2016: nil.
The Groups contingent tax liability on investment properties, calculated on the same tax base cost as above but based on a deemed market value disposal at year end, is nil 2016: nil.
A disposal of the Groups trading properties at their market value as per note 15 Property Portfolio, net of available losses, would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 1.6 million 19.25 per cent of 8.3 million.

Under the terms of the CLSA, the Group can draw down land in phases but no land can be transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession is given.
The Group has already paid 75.0 million of the 105.0 million cash consideration payable under the CLSA.
The residual 30.0 million will be settled in two annual instalments of 15.0 million with the next payment due on 31 December 2018.

Should any payments be made in respect of these obligations, they will be deducted from the total consideration payable to LBHF refer to note 29 Capital Commitments.
In March 2013, an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West London Line where it runs within the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area.
Within the terms of the agreement, the Group can exercise options during the next 50 years for further 999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow for development within the Earls Court Masterplan.
Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan.
Any further payments to Network Rail will be treated as contingent rent as per note 24 Finance Lease Obligations.
Within the terms of the agreement of the acquisition of the Northern Access Road land, the vendors successor in title is entitled to further payments until 2027 if certain conditions are met.
Further payments become due following the grant of a planning permission for change of use or on disposal.
In the event such planning permission is implemented, the payment is calculated at 50 per cent of the uplift in land value following the grant of the permission.
In the event of a disposal, the payment is calculated as 50 per cent of the difference between the sale value against the land value without the relevant permission.

com 1 133 33 Notes to the accounts continued 33 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives.
All schemes are equity settled with the increase in equity measured by reference to the fair value of the Groups equity instruments at the grant date of the share awards.
The corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of share-based payments for 2017 was 2.0 million 2016: 1.1 million.
All options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
The fair value of share awards is determined by the market price of the shares at the grant date.
Full details of the performance criteria, vesting outcomes and any additional holding periods for the performance share plan, and the former performance and matching share plans, are set out within the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 86.
