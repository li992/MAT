One such area which has featured highly on the Audit Committees agenda during 2017 and will continue to do so is product safety.
Care for the health and safety of everyone who comes into contact with Howdens, be they employees, customers, or suppliers, is integral to our principles and to our behaviour.
By order of the Board Product safety and the ability of companies to successfully undertake product recall programmes came under increased scrutiny during 2017.
To that end the Government has taken action by launching the Office for Product Safety and Standards to support companies on such matters but Andrew Cripps the onus remains on manufacturers, producers and sellers of products to safeguard their customers and their customers customer.
Howdens takes its social and legal responsibilities for product safety Audit Committee Chairman and product recall preparedness very seriously.
As a producer of our own Lamona branded kitchen 28 February 2018 appliances, we are acutely aware that we are responsible for the products we produce.
Whilst these products should be affordable, reliable and energy-efficient, first and foremost they need to be safe.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that there are extensive mitigating measures to ensure our products are safe: the safety of those using products supplied by Howdens is fundamental to our primary aim of being a business which is worthwhile for all concerned.
Following an internal audit review undertaken during 2016, the Audit Committee requested an update on the actions against the recommendations from management.
At the July Audit Committee meeting the Chief Operating Officer for the Supply division provided an update on the progress of the recommendations against plan.
At the meeting, he confirmed that: A c ross-divisional Product Safety Committee had been established in order to review the strategic objectives and initiatives concerning product safety and product recall processes.
