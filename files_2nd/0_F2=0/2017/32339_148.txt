Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euroand US Dollar-denominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step-up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to the groups 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash flows will affect the groups income statement as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings seenote 25.
We hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific currencies 12 months forward, with certain specific transactions hedged further forward.
The related cash flows are recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash flow hedges were effective in the period.
See note 28 for details of the movements in the cash flow reserve.
Fair value hedges Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 26.
Other derivatives Our policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.
