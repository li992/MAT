NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Significant accounting policies BASIS OF PREPARATION Accounting policies applicable to more than one section of the financial statements are shown below.
Where accounting policies relate to a specific note in the financial statements, they are set out within that note, to provide readers of the financial statements with a more useful layout to the financial information presented.
Statement of compliance Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interest in associates.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
TheParent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
TheCompany has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented onpages 152 to 156.
IFRSs announced but not yet effective The following IFRSs have been announced, but are not yet effective, in the preparation of these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.
Certain of these standards and interpretations will, when adopted require addition to, or amendment of, disclosures in the accounts, and are currently still under review.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2018 management has completed its analysis of this standard, andidentified the following areas of note, though its adoption is not expected to have a material impact.
The Group intends to apply the limited exemption in IFRS 9, and will elect not to restate comparative information in the year of initial adoption.
As a result, the comparative information provided will, continue to be accountedfor in accordance with the Groups previous accounting policy.
Classification and measurement of financial assets the Groups financial assets comprise trade receivables, accrued income andcash and cash equivalents.
The disclosures relating to both trade receivables, accrued income and cash and cash equivalents continue to be applicable and will not be affected by the adoption of IFRS 9.
There are no changes to the measurement of financialassets.
Impairment of financial assets, by introducing a forward-looking expected loss impairment model the Groups primary typesof financial assets subject to IFRS 9s new expected credit loss model are trade receivables and accrued income.
For trade receivables and accrued income, the Group is expecting to apply the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires the useof the lifetime expected loss provision for all receivables.
There is no material change expected to the impairment provision ofreceivables.
Hedge accounting the Group intends to continue to apply its current IAS 39 accounting and will provide the additional IFRS 7 disclosures required for taking that option.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers effective 1 January 2018 management has completed its analysis ofthis standard and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition based on the Groups current revenue streams.
Specifically, the Groups revenue streams are two-fold: Revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service iscompleted, usually when the report of findings or test inspection certificate is issued.
The adoption of IFRS 15 has no material impact on the recognition of such revenue.
On long-term projects the Group records transactions as revenue on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding amountbeing included in trade receivables if the customer has been invoiced, or in accrued income if billing has yet to be completed.
Long-term projects consist of two main types: time incurred is billed at agreed rates on a periodic basis, such as monthly the current recognition approach is based on timesheets evidencing work done this is consistent with the over time recognition criteria under IFRS 15 using those timesheets as the input basis: or staged payment invoicing occurs, requiring an assessment of percentage completion, based on services provided and revenue accrued accordingly assessment of percentage completion will continue in the same way this is in line with the over time recognition under IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments anda right-of-use asset for lease contracts, subject to limited exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.
Management intends to apply the modified retrospective method of transition and will continue to determine the most appropriate treatment under that method on a lease-by-lease basis.
The quantitative impact of IFRS 16 on the Groups net assets and results is in the process of being assessed, and management has collated its initial data set to determine the impact on the Group.
IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the balance sheet as both assets and liabilities will increase, and a material impact on key components within the income statement, as operating lease rental charges will be replaced by depreciation and finance costs.
Please refer to Note 8 to the financial statements which gives an indication of the Group's total operating lease commitments.
IFRS 16 will not have any impact on the underlying commercial performance of the Group, nor the cash flows generated in the year.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 109 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as discussed in the relevant accounting policies.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
All information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies set out in these financial statements have been applied consistently to all years presented.
A number of newstandards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, but do not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Going concern The Board has reviewed forecasts, including forecasts adjusted for significantly worse economic conditions.
The Board has also reviewed the Groups funding requirements and the available debt facilities.
As a result of these reviews the Board remains satisfied with the Groups funding and liquidity position and believes that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Inaddition, on the basis of its forecasts, both base case and stressed, and available facilities, which are described innote14, the Board has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns from the investee and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of investor returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
For purchases of non-controlling interest in subsidiaries, the difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary and the non-controlling interests share of the assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position at thedate of acquisition, is reflected directly in shareholders equity.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way asunrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
FOREIGN CURRENCY Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities for example cash, trade receivables, trade payables denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are generally recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
For the policy on hedging of foreign currency transactions see note 14.
Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated tosterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at cumulative average rates of exchange during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are taken directly to equity in the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal.
For the policy on net investment hedging see note 14.
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: Assets and liabilities Income and expenses Actual rates Cumulative average rates Value of 1 31Dec 2017 31Dec 2016 2017 2016 US dollar 1.34 1.22 1.29 1.35 Euro 1.13 1.17 1.14 1.23 Chinese renminbi 8.79 8.51 8.72 8.98 Hong Kong dollar 10.47 9.49 10.05 10.52 Australian dollar 1.72 1.70 1.68 1.83 110 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Significant accounting policies continued USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
During the year, management reassessed its critical estimates and judgements and resolved that the following disclosure was nolonger considered critical, as management does not expect there to be a significant risk of material change to the carrying value ofthose liabilities within the next year.
Put option over non-controlling interest The calculation of the fair value of put options over the non-controlling interest in the Groups businesses in the relevant countries required the use of judgement in the application of key assumptions around the future performance of those businesses: the riskadjusted discount rate taking into account the risk-free rate and the gross domestic product growth in those countries.
JUDGEMENTS In applying the Groups accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact onthe amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Income and deferred tax The tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations.
Where the effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, judgements are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised, with consideration given to the timing and level of future taxable income.
The main areas of judgement in the Group tax calculation are re-assessment ofthe uncertain tax provisions for the full year and re-assessment of the recognition and recoverability of the UK deferred tax asset see note 6.
Basis of consolidation Judgement is applied when determining if the Group controls a subsidiary.
In assessing control, the Group considers whether it has the power to direct the relevant activities, whether it has exposure to variable returns from the investee and whether ithas power over the investee to affect the amount of investor returns.
Our original assessments are subsequently revisited on a rolling basis see Basis of Consolidation policy.
Intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, e. g. KJ Tech Services GmbH and Acumen Security LLC in 2017, management determines initially whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill, and the provisional amounts at which to recognise those assets.
During the first12 months of ownership, intangible assets are reviewed to determine whether any additional information exists that supports amendments to that original assessment, including new intangible assets.
Management has performed this subsequent review for FIT Italia SRL, EWA-Canada, Ltd and Laboratorios ABC Quimica, Investigacin y Anlisis, S. A. fide C. V during the current year see note 9.
Restructuring In making a provision and classifying costs as restructuring, management has used its judgement to assess the specific circumstances of each local and regional restructuring proposal as to whether it meets the Group definition of this SDI, including an estimate of future costs and the timing of completion see note 3.
Claims In making provision for claims, management has used its judgement to assess the circumstances relating to each specific event, internal and external legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents seenote 13.

Impairment of goodwill Following recognition of goodwill as a result of acquisitions, the Group determines, as a minimum on an annual basis, whether goodwill is impaired, which requires an estimation of the future cash flows of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated, aswell as assumptions on long-term growth rates and discount rates see note 9.
Contingent consideration When the Group acquires businesses, the total consideration may consist of an amount paid on completion plus further amounts payable on agreed post completion dates.
These further amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets.
At the date of acquisition and at subsequent reporting periods, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due.
Further details and sensitivity analysis are included in note 10.
Employee post-retirement benefit obligations For material defined benefit plans, the actuarial valuation includes assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates.
Further details and sensitivity analysis are included in note 16.
Recoverability of trade receivables Trade receivables are reflected, net of an estimated provision for impairment losses.
This provision considers the past payment historyand the length of time that the debts have remained unpaid.
Further details are included in note 11.

Revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service iscompleted, usually when the report of findings is issued.
On long-term projects the Group records transactions as sales on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding amount being included in trade receivables if the customer has been invoiced or in accrued income if billing has yet to be completed.
Long-term projects consist of two main types: a time incurred is billed at agreed rates on a periodic basis, such as monthly: or b staged payment invoicing occurs, requiring an assessment of percentage completion, based on services provided and revenue accrued accordingly.
Expenses are recharged to clients where permitted by the contract.
Payments received in advance from customers are recognised indeferred income where services have not yet been rendered.
OPERATING SEGMENTS The Group is organised into business lines, which are the Groups operating segments and are reported to the CEO, the chief operating decision maker.
These operating segments are aggregated into three divisions, which are the Groups reportable segments, based on similar nature ofproducts and services and midto long-term structural growth drivers.
The costs of the corporate head office and other costs whichare not controlled by the three divisions are allocated appropriately.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
There is no significant seasonality in the Groups operations.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Theperformance of the segments is assessed based on adjusted operating profit which is stated before Separately Disclosed Items.

114 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 Separately Disclosed Items ACCOUNTING POLICY Adjusted results In order to present the performance of the Group in a clear, consistent and comparable format, certain items are disclosed separately onthe face of the income statement.
Separately Disclosed Items are items which by their nature or size, in the opinion of the Directors, should be excluded from the adjusted result to provide readers with a clear and consistent view of the business performance of the Group and its operating divisions.
When applicable, these items include amortisation of acquisition intangibles: impairment of goodwill and other assets: the profit orlosson disposals of businesses or other significant fixed assets: costs of acquiring and integrating acquisitions: the cost of any fundamental restructuring: material claims and settlements: significant recycling of amounts from equity to the income statement: andunrealised market or fair value gains or losses on financial assets or liabilities, including contingent consideration.
Adjusted operating profit excludes the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, as we do not believe that the amortisation charge in the Income Statement provides useful information about the cash costs of running our business as these assets will be supported and maintained by the ongoing marketing and promotional expenditure, which is already reflected in operating costs.
Amortisation of software, however, is included in adjusted operating profit as it is similar in nature to other capital expenditure.
The costs of any restructuring are excluded from adjusted operating profit where they represent fundamental changes in individual operations around the Group identified as part of the Group's strategy that are not expected to recur in those operations.
The impairment of goodwill and other assets that by their nature or size are not expected to recur: the profit and loss on disposals of businesses or other significant assets: and the costs associated with successful, active or aborted acquisitions are excluded from adjusted operating profit to provide useful information regarding the underlying performance of the Groups operations.
SEPARATELY DISCLOSED ITEMS The Separately Disclosed Items are described in the table below: 2017 2016 m m Operating costs: Amortisation of acquisition intangibles a 16.0 14.0 Acquisition costs b 3.2 2.8 Restructuring costs c 12.4 21.4 Loss on disposal of businesses d 2.0 Impairment of goodwill and other assets e 16.8 Material claims and settlements f 3.4 Total operating costs 45.0 40.2 Net financing costs g 0.5 Total before income tax 45.5 40.2 Income tax credit on Separately Disclosed Items 20.6 22.5 Total 24.9 17.7 a Of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles in the current year, 4.1m 2016: 3.9m relates to the customer contracts and customer relationships acquired with the purchase of Moody International Limited Moody in 2011, and 5.1m 2016: 5.0m relates to the customer relationships acquired with the purchase of PSI Group in 2015. b Acquisition costs comprise 3.6m 2016: 2.5m for transaction costs in respect of successful, active and aborted acquisitions in the current year, and 0.4m income inrespectofprior years acquisitions 2016: 0.3m cost.
c During the year, the Group has implemented various fundamental restructuring activities, consistent with the Group's 5x5 strategy.
These activities included site consolidations, closure of non-core business units, re-engineering ofunderperforming businesses and the delayering of management structures.
"d 2.0m of small non-core businesses were disposed of in 2016. e Consistent with the corporate 5x5 strategy objective of ""Superior Technology"" announced in 2016, the Group has recorded an impairment of other assets of 8.0m 2016: nil following a comprehensive strategic review of the Global IT organisation structure and system finalised in April 2017."
This review resulted in restructuring costs of 0.5m included above and 8.0m in relation to the impairment of assets respectively.
In addition, 8.8m 2016: nil of plant and equipment was impaired in full, related to a specific service line in the Resources division that is no longer an area of focus for the Group.
f Material claims and settlements relate to a commercial claim that is separately disclosable due to its size.
g Net financing costs of 0.5m 2016: nil relate to the change in fair value of contingent consideration and the unwinding of discount on put options related to acquisitions.

Income tax is recognised in the same primary statement as the accounting transaction to which it relates.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the outcome of discussions with tax authorities is different from the amount initially recorded, this difference will impact the tax provisions in the period the determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for: recognition of consolidated goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interest in joint ventures, the reversal of which isunder the control of the Group and where it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, for the periods when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
TAX EXPENSE The Group operates across many different tax jurisdictions.
Income and profits are earned and taxed in the individual countries in whichthey occur.
The income tax expense for the profit before tax for the 12 months ended 31December 2017 is 86.9m 2016: 75.5m.
The Groups consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31December 2017 is 22.1% 2016: 21.8%.
The income tax expense for the adjusted profit before tax for the 12 months ended 31December 2017 is 107.5m 2016: 98.0m.
The Groups adjusted consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31December 2017 is 24.5% 2016: 25.3%.
Differences between the consolidated effective tax rate of 22.1% and notional statutory UK rate of 19.25% include, but are not limited to: the mix of profits: the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions: non-deductible expenses: the effect of utilised tax losses: and under over provisions in previous periods.
The Group receives tax incentives in certain jurisdictions, resulting in a lower tax charge to the income statement.
Without these incentives the adjusted effective tax rate would be 27.0% 2016: 28.0%.
The Groups tax rate is affected by its financing arrangements that are in place to fund business operations in overseas territories.
There is no guarantee that these reduced rates will continue to be applicable in future years see note 22.
The new US tax legislation is complex and wide-ranging.
Whilst we anticipate that there will be no material effect on the Groups adjusted effective tax rate for the year 31 December 2018 and subsequent years, the impact of the legislation has been estimated at 31 December 2017 and may be further refined prior to 31 December 2018 and subsequent years.
For the year 31 December 2017, we have a one-off benefit on the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangibles and other assets for the change in the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.
Without this benefit, the adjusted effective tax rate would be 25.5% and the consolidated effective tax rate would be 25.3%.

There is a temporary difference of 240.0m 2016: 296.2m which relates to unremitted post-acquisition overseas earnings.
Nodeferred tax is provided on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either repatriate from, or sell, the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
7 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations.
In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33 Earnings Per Share, an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairment and other Separately Disclosed Items.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Leased assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Other leases are operating leases These leased assets are not recognised in the Groups statement of financial position.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the expected lease term and their useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings Term of lease Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment 3 to 10 years Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of assets are reassessed at each reporting date.
Impairment Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated to determine the level of any impairment.

9 Goodwill and other intangible assets ACCOUNTING POLICY Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Acquisitions on or after 1January 2010 From 1 January 2010, the Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008. Business combinations areaccounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is obtained.
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the net recognised amount generally fair value ofthe identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to acquisitions are shown in Separately Disclosed Items.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised in profit or loss.
If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally, then these values are used.
Adjustments to the fair values can be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and aretaken as adjustments to goodwill.
Acquisitions between 1January 2004 and 31December 2009 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition overthe Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities oftheacquiree.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection withbusiness combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 123 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Other intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill.
If, based on managements judgement, such an asset is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, and which have finite useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives areas follows: Computer software Up to 7 years Customer relationships Up to 10 years Know-how Up to 5 years Trade names Up to 5 years Licences Contractual life Covenants not to compete Contractual life Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position may be less than its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset or group of assets, i. e. cash generating unit, to which the goodwill relates.
A CGU represents an asset grouping at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties and if different estimates were used this could materially change the projected value of the cash flows.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
The average remaining amortisation period for customer relationships is six years 2016: seven years.
Computer software net book value of 79.0m at 31December 2017 2016: 85.5m includes software in construction of 38.5m 2016:32.0m.

Additions during the year are converted at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and the goodwill at the end ofthe year is stated at closing exchange rates.
Impairment review In order to determine whether impairments are required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of each operating segment orCGU.
The calculation is based on projecting future cash flows over a five-year period and using a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter.
A discount factor is applied to obtain a value in use which is the recoverable amount.
Key assumptions The key assumptions include the rate of revenue and profit growth within each of the territories and business lines in which the Group operates.
These are based on the Groups approved budget and five-year Strategic Plan.
The long-term growth rate is also key since it is used in the perpetuity calculations.
Finally, the discount rate used to bring the cash flow back to a present value varies depending on the location of the operation and the nature of the operations.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to long-term growth rates and discount rates.
Long-term growth rates predict growth beyond the Groups planning cycle, and range from 1.7% to 2.5% 2016: 1.7% to 2.5%.
The discount rate for each CGU reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the CGU.
Sensitivity analysis None of the reasonable downside sensitivity scenarios on key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of each CGU to exceed itsrecoverable amount.
The sensitivities modelled by management include: i Assuming revenues decline each year by 1% in 2019 to 2022 from the 2018 budgeted revenues, with margins increasing with baseassumptions.
ii Assuming zero growth in operating profit margins in 2018 to 2022 with revenues increasing per base assumptions.
iii Assuming an increase in the discount rates used by 1%.
Management considers that the likelihood of any or all of the above scenarios occurring is low.
"126 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 10 Acquisitions ACQUISITIONS IN 2017 On 31 March 2017, the Group acquired KJ Tech Services GmbH ""KJ Tech"", a leading provider of vehicle, component and fuel testing services based in Germany, for an estimated purchase price of 12.8m 12.5m net of cash acquired, generating goodwill of 7.6m."

Provisional details of the net assets acquired and fair value adjustments are set out in the following tables.
These analyses are provisional and amendments may be made to these figures in the 12 months following the date of acquisition.

Goodwill inrespect of 2016 acquisitions decreased by 2.9m.
The goodwill arising represents the value of the assembled workforce and the benefits the Company expects to gain from increasing its presence in the relevant sectors in which the acquired businesses operate.
The intangible assets of 6.0m primarily represent the value placed on customer relationships and the deferred tax thereon was 2.0m.
Consideration paid The total cash consideration paid for the acquisitions in the year was 29.5m 2016: 35.5m, with further contingent consideration payable of 9.0m which is recognised in note 13.
Cash consideration includes cash and debt acquired of 2.1m.
The estimated purchase price net of cash and debt acquired was 36.4m.
Contribution of acquisitions to revenue and profits In total acquisitions made during 2017 contributed revenues of 4.8m and a net profit after tax of 0.4m from their respective dates of acquisition to 31December 2017.
The Group revenue and profit after tax for the year ended 31December 2017 would have been 2,775.6m and 308.5m respectively if all the acquisitions were assumed to have been made on 1January 2017.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in deriving the contingent consideration to be recognised include the weighted probability of making a payout assessed as being between 50% to 100% and the discount rate used to bring the cash flow back to present values.
The discount rates used for the calculation are aligned with the discount rates used for impairment purposes as set out in Note 9.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that an increase of 1% in the discount rate used to calculate the contingent consideration would have decreased the financial liability by 0.3m, and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the financial liability by 0.3m.
It has also been estimated that an increase of 10% in the probability used to calculate the contingent consideration would have increased the financial liability by 1.5m, whilst a decrease of 10% in the probability used would have decreased the financial liability by 1.7m.

128 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11 Trade and other receivables ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
Based on historical default rates, reflecting the track record of payments by the Groups customers, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables which are less than six months outstanding, unless there are specific circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a customer which would render the trade receivable irrecoverable.
The Group provides for trade receivables over 12 months old that are considered likely to be irrecoverable, 25% of balances 6 to 12 months old and specific provision for known doubtful debts regardless of age.
Where recovery is in doubt, a provision is made against the specific trade receivable until such time as the Group believes the amount tobe irrecoverable, after which the trade receivable is written off.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade and other receivables are analysed below: 2017 2016 m m Trade receivables 469.5 472.8 Other receivables 51.3 60.0 Prepayments and accrued income 120.9 118.9 Fixed assets held for resale 0.1 Total trade and other receivables 641.7 651.8 Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for impairment losses of 24.0m 2016: 23.9m and are all expected to be recovered within 12 months.
Impairment on trade receivables charged as part of operating costs was 8.8m 2016: 8.6m.
There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their short-term duration.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number ofcustomers who are internationally dispersed.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows: 2017 2016 m m Under 3 months 397.0 399.9 Between 3 and 6 months 47.4 49.0 Between 6 and 12 months 19.2 27.5 Over 12 months 29.9 20.3 Gross trade receivables 493.5 496.7 Allowance for impairment 24.0 23.9 Trade receivables, net of allowance 469.5 472.8 Included in trade receivables under three months of 397.0m 2016: 399.9m are trade receivables of 340.6m 2016: 349.2m that are not yet due for payment.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2017 2016 Impairment allowance for doubtful trade receivables m m At 1January 23.9 20.0 Exchange differences 2.0 3.1 Impairment loss recognised 8.8 8.6 Receivables written off 6.7 7.8 At 31December 24.0 23.9 Sensitivity analysis The remaining unprovided amount of receivables is 14.4m for receivables between 6 and 12 months old and 10.7m for receivables over 12 months old.
The total amount of these receivables was not impaired because, having given consideration to the nature of the receivables and their historical collection, recovery of the unprovided amount is expected in due course.
There were no material individual impairments of trade receivables.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 129 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 12 Trade and other payables ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade payables Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier.
The carrying value of trade payables is considered approximate to fair value.
Put option over non-controlling interest Put options held by non-controlling interests that arise on acquisition are recognised initially at the present value of the redemption amount.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The discount is unwound through SDIs as a finance charge.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables are analysed below: Current Current Non-current Non-current 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Trade payables 126.7 107.3 Other payables 45.5 25.5 17.5 26.1 Accruals and deferred income 280.0 274.0 4.1 7.6 Total trade and other payables 452.2 406.8 21.6 33.7 The Groups exposure to liquidity risk related to trade payables is disclosed in note 14.
The key assumptions in arriving at the value of the put options over shares held by non-controlling interests are the performance of those businesses: the risk-adjusted discount rate taking into account the risk-free rate and the gross domestic product growth in the countries of those underlying businesses.
13 Provisions ACCOUNTING POLICY A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

The Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business.
Theoutcome of such litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings.
Based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of 14.0m 2016: 19.5m represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs.
The timing of the cash outflow relating tothe provisions is uncertain, but is likely to be within one year.
Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note22.
The other provision of 12.6m 2016: 14.5m includes restructuring provisions.
The timing of the cash outflow is uncertain, but islikely to be within one year.
130 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 Borrowings and financial instruments ACCOUNTING POLICY Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest expense on borrowings: facility fees: interest receivable on funds invested: net foreign exchange gains or losses: interest income and expense relating to pension assets and liabilities: unrealised market or fair value gains or losses on financial assets or liabilities, including contingent consideration: and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue usingthe effective interest rate method.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses including bad debt provision.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Net debt comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The fair value of put option liabilities over non-controlling interests is calculated using a present value calculation, incorporating observable and non-observable inputs.
This valuation technique has been adopted as it most closely mirrors the contractual arrangement.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts, to hedge economically its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value at each period end is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the difference between the quoted forward price and the exercise price of the contract.
Hedging Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement in the same caption as the foreign exchange on the related item.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group has external borrowings denominated in foreign currencies which are used to hedge the net investment in its foreignoperations.
Cash flow hedges Cash flow hedges comprise derivative financial instruments designated in a hedging relationship to manage interest rate risk to which the cash flows of certain assets and liabilities are exposed.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
However, where a forecasted transaction results in a non-financial asset or liability, the accumulated fair value movements previously deferred in equity are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.
Impairment A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired.
Afinancial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect onthe estimated future cash flows of that asset.

FINANCIAL RISKS Details of the Groups treasury controls, exposures and the policies and processes for managing capital and credit, liquidity, interestrate and currency risk are set out below, and in the Strategic Report Financial Review that starts on page 38. Credit risk Exposure to credit risk Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
The Group monitors the creditworthiness of customers on an ongoing basis.
The Groups credit risk is diversified due to the large number ofentities, industries and regions that make up the Groups customer base.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
At the reporting date this was as follows: 2017 2016 m m Trade receivables, net of allowance note 11 469.5 472.8 Cash and cash equivalents 135.9 158.8 Total 605.4 631.6 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows: 2017 2016 m m Asia Pacific 127.1 131.5 Americas 180.6 180.4 Europe, Middle East and Africa 161.8 160.9 Total 469.5 472.8 Counterparty risk Cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing facilities are at risk in the event that the counterparty is not able to meet its obligations in regards to the cash held or facilities available to the Group.
The Group also enters into transactions with counterparties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
If the counterparty was not able to meet its obligations, the Group may be exposed to additional foreign currency or interest rate risk.
The Group, wherever possible, enters into arrangements with counterparties who have robust credit standing, which the Group defines as a financial institution with a credit rating of at least investment grade.
The Group has existing banking relationships with a number ofrelationship banks that meet this criterion, and seeks to use their services wherever possible while avoiding excessive concentration of credit risk.
Given the diverse geographic nature of the Groups activities, it is not always possible to use a relationship bank.
Therefore the Group has set limits on the level of deposits to be held at non-relationship banks to minimise the risk to the Group.
It is also Group policy to remit any excess funds from local entities back to Intertek Group Treasury in the UK.
Given the controls in place, and based on a current assessment of our banking relationships, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
134 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as and when they fall due.
The Groups policy is to: ensure sufficient liquidity is available to Group companies in the amounts, currencies and locations required to support the Groups operations: ensure the Group has adequate available sources of funding to protect against unforeseen internal and external events: and avoid excess liquidity which restricts growth and impacts the cost of financing.
To ensure this policy is met, the Group monitors cash balances on a daily basis, projects cash requirements on a rolling basis andfunds itself using debt instruments with a range of maturities.

Under the Groups Treasury policy, management may fix the interest rates on up to 80% of the Groups debt portfolio for the period of the current financial year.
The Groups debt portfolio beyond this period is to be managed within the range of a 20%-60% fixed to floating rate ratio.
To do this the Group uses hedging instruments where considered appropriate.
A cash flow hedge is in place in respect of a borrowing that is repayable in 2020.
Sensitivity At 31December 2017, it is estimated that the impact on variable rate net debt of a general increase of 3% in interest rates would be a decrease in the Groups profit before tax of approximately 5.4m 2016: 9.3m.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
Foreign currency risk The Groups objective in managing foreign currency risk is to safeguard the Groups financial assets from economic loss due to fluctuations in foreign currencies, and to protect margins on cross currency contracts and operations.
To achieve this, the Groups policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposures where appropriate.
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Groups shareholders funds and a substantial percentage of the Groups revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups profit is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: i translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and ii transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash flows in various currencies.
The foreign currency profiles of cash, trade receivables and payables subject to translation risk and transaction risk, at the reporting date were as follows: Carrying Chinese Hong Kong Other amount Sterling US dollar renminbi dollar currencies 2017 m m m m m m Cash 135.9 13.7 10.3 24.3 3.4 84.2 Trade receivables note 11 469.5 43.6 156.6 44.6 14.5 210.2 Trade payables note 12 126.7 13.6 39.8 17.1 3.5 52.7 2016 Cash 158.8 4.1 7.6 55.0 1.0 91.1 Trade receivables note 11 472.8 44.8 158.6 44.9 14.0 210.5 Trade payables note 12 107.3 14.6 30.8 14.9 3.7 43.3 136 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued RECOGNISED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
HEDGE OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES The Groups foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Groups investment in its respective subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of these loans at 31December 2017 was 655.1m 2016: 857.7m.
A foreign exchange gain of 77.3m 2016: loss 194.1m was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these loans to sterling.
SENSITIVITY It is estimated that a general increase of 10% in the value of sterling against the US dollar the main currency impacting the Group would have decreased the Groups profit before tax for 2017 by approximately 21.6m 2016: 20.8m.

138 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 16 Employee benefits ACCOUNTING POLICY Pension schemes Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Groups net obligation in respect of material defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating theamount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value.
The fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
In calculating the defined benefit deficit, the discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit credit method.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees services in the accounting period is charged to the operating profit in the income statement.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the present value of the schemes liabilities, during the accounting period, are shown as finance income and finance expense respectively.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland.
TheUnited Kingdom Scheme and Hong Kong Scheme are funded, with assets held in separate trustee-administered funds and the Switzerland Scheme is an insured scheme.
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants in 2002 and 2000, respectively.
Other funded defined benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The Group recognises all actuarial remeasurements in each year in equity through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In June 2011, the International Accounting Standards Board issued revisions to IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 that provide changes inthe recognition, presentation and disclosure of post-employment benefits.
The Group has adopted the revised accounting standard from 1January 2013.

Pooled investment vehicles including the of the Absolute Return Fund LDI Funds which are not traded on active markets, but where the investment manager has provided a monthly trading price, are valued using the last single price, provided by the investment manager at or before the year end.
The Absolute Return Fund aims to provide positive investment returns in all conditions over the mediumto long-term.
The investment managers have a wide investment remit and look to exploit market inefficiencies through active allocation to a diverse range of market positions.
The Fund uses a combination of traditional assets and investment strategies based on derivatives and is able to take longand short-term positions in markets.
The LDI Fund provides the hedge against adverse movements in inflation and interest rates.
It seeks to match the sensitivity of the Schemes liability cash flow tochanges in interest rates and inflation: it is invested in gilts, swaps, futures, repo contracts and money market instruments.
The United Kingdom Scheme had bank account assets of 0.5m as at 31December 2017 2016: 0.3m.
The United Kingdom Scheme invested assets comprise both quoted and unquoted assets, whilst all of the invested assets of the Hong Kong Scheme are unquoted.

INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 141 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 16 Employee benefits continued Life expectancy assumptions at year end for: United Kingdom Scheme Hong Kong Scheme Switzerland Scheme 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Male aged 40 49.0 49.4 n a n a 42.8 42.8 Male aged 65 22.1 22.2 n a n a 19.8 19.8 Female aged 40 50.9 51.5 n a n a 45.4 45.4 Female aged 65 24.0 24.2 n a n a 21.9 21.9 The retirement arrangement in Hong Kong pays a lump sum to members instead of a pension at the point of retirement.
Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to the life expectancy of the member, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong Scheme.
T he table above shows, for the United Kingdom Scheme, the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 31December.
The mortality tables adopted in 2017 for the United Kingdom Scheme are the S2PA projected by year of birth, based on the CMI 2016 mortality projection model with a 1.25% long-term annual rate for future improvement.
In 2016 the S2PA tables were used, based on the CMI 2015 mortality projection model.
For the Switzerland Scheme, the mortality table adopted in both 2017 and 2016 is the BVG2015, anindustry standard in Switzerland which is based on statistical evidence of major Switzerland pension funds.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The table below sets out the sensitivity on the United Kingdom and Hong Kong pension assets and liabilities as at 31December2017 of the two main assumptions: UK Scheme Hong Kong Scheme Increase Increase decrease decrease Liabilities in deficit Liabilities in deficit Change in assumptions m m m m No change 127.6 25.5 0.25% rise in discount rate 121.7 5.9 24.9 0.6 0.25% fall in discount rate 133.9 6.3 26.1 0.6 0.25% rise in inflation 132.8 5.2 n a n a 0.25% fall in inflation 122.6 5.0 n a n a The United Kingdom Scheme is also subject to the mortality assumption.
If the mortality tables used are rated up down one year, the value placed on the liabilities increases by 5.9m and decreases by 5.8m respectively.
FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS United Kingdom Scheme The Trustees use the Projected Unit credit method with a three-year control period.
Currently the scheme members pay contributions at the rate of 8.5% of salary.
The employer pays contributions of 16.4% of salary, plus 0.2m per year to fundscheme expenses, and has made an additional contribution of 2.0m in 2018 to reduce the deficit disclosed by the 2016valuation.
Hong Kong Scheme The Trustees use the Attained Age funding method.
The last actuarial valuation was as at 31December 2016.
Scheme members do not contribute to the scheme.
The employer pays contributions of 11.5% of salaries including 0.6% in respect of schemeexpenses.
Funding Risks The main risks for the schemes are: Investment return risk: If the assets underperform the returns assumed in setting the funding targets then additional contributions may be required at subsequent valuations.
Investment matching risk: The schemes invest significantly in equities, whereas the funding targets are closely related to thereturns on bonds.
If equities fall in value relative to the matching asset of bonds, additional contributions may be required.
Longevity risk: If future improvements in longevity exceed the assumptions made for scheme funding then additional contributions may be required.
Role of Third Parties The United Kingdom Scheme is managed by Trustees on behalf of its members.
The Trustees take advice from appropriate third parties including investment advisors, actuaries and lawyers as necessary.
142 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17 Share schemes ACCOUNTING POLICY Share-based payment transactions The share-based compensation plans operated by the Group allow employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value ofthe employee services, received in exchange for the grant of shares, is measured at the grant date and is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The charge is calculated using the Monte Carlo method and expensed to the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant award.
The charge for the Deferred Share Awards is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting for service conditions.
The expense of the LTIP Share Awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes method and is adjusted for the probability of EPS performance conditions being achieved.
The Group has taken advantage of the provisions of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, andhas recognised an expense only in respect of share awards granted since 7 November 2002.
SHARE PLANS 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan The Deferred Bonus Plan 2005 was replaced in 2011 with the Intertek 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan the 'LTIP'.

Awards may be granted under the DSP to employees of the Group other than the Executive Directors of the Company selected by the Remuneration Committee over existing, issued ordinary shares of the Company only.
The DSP was adopted primarily to allow for the deferral of a proportion of selected employees annual bonus into shares in the Company, but may also be used for the grant of other awards such as incentive awards and buy out awards for key employees in circumstances that the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate.
The initial award under the DSP had a two-year vesting period: any subsequent awards will normally have a three-year vesting period.
Awards may be made subject to performance conditions and are subject to normal good and bad leaver provisions and malus and clawback.
