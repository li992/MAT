Financial Statements On 22 December 2017, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was given legislative effect in the US.
The principal change for the Group is the reduction in the headline rate of Federal Corporate tax from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018.
The change in Federal rate will contribute to a fall in the Groups future effective rate from where it otherwise would have been.
Assuming the Groups current taxable profits by territory remain unchanged, the net benefit of the Acts changes is estimated to be worth approximately 2.5ppts off the Groups effective tax rate.
The change in rate also resulted in a reduction in the Groups US net deferred tax liability at 31 December 2017, with the 7.7m benefit treated as exceptional in these financial statements.
