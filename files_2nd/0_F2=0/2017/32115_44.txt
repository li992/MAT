LTIP awards are based on Incentive Units.
One Incentive Unit has a value equal to one of the Companys ordinary shares but subject to performance conditions.
LTIP awards are not share options and are valued using a separate simulation model and disclosures in respect of exercise prices, expected volatility and risk free rates are not applicable.
Expectations of meeting market-based performance criteria are reflected in the fair value of the LTIP awards.
