240 Virgin Money Group Annual Report 2017 I Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 31: Contingent liabilities and commitments Contingent liabilities The Board was not aware of any significant contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: none.
The Company is, from time to time and in the normal course of business, subject to a variety of legal or regulatory claims, actions or proceedings.
When such circumstances arise, the Board considers the likelihood of a material outflow of economic resources and provides for its best estimate of costs where an outflow of economic resources is considered probable.
While there can be no assurances, the Directors believe, based on information currently available to them, that the likelihood of material outflows from such matters is remote.
The Board does not expect the ultimate resolution of any other threatened or actual legal proceedings to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
Loan commitments Contractual amounts to which the Group is committed for extension of credit to customers.
