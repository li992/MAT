31 Acquisition of Home Retail Group plc Accounting policies for business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of identifiable assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
On 2 September 2016, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Home Retail Group plc HRG, a listed company based in the United Kingdom, by means of a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the Act for a consideration of 1,093 million.
The full analysis of the consideration is shown below: Consideration fair value at acquisition date Form of consideration m Cash of 447 million being 55p per existing share : fair value is based on Home Retail Group plcs share capital of 813,445,001 shares 447 in existence as at the acquisition date 3 million in relation to the contractual requirement to settle certain existing HRG share scheme awards and options 3 4 261 million new J Sainsbury plc shares of 28 p nominal value each were issued being 0.321 new J Sainsbury plc shares per existing 643 7 Home Retail Group plc share : fair value of the consideration is based on a J Sainsbury plc share price of 2.4610 as of 2 September 2016 Total 1,093 Financial Statements 169 31 Acquisition of Home Retail Group plc continued Home Retail Groups activities mainly comprise General Merchandise related retail.
The acquisition is expected to accelerate Sainsburys growth strategy in General Merchandise & Clothing retail as well as its online presence.
The combination brings together two of the UKs leading retail businesses with complementary product offers through an integrated, multi-channel proposition.
None of the goodwill recognised of 58 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
This was calculated as the difference between the fair value of consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired as set out in the following table.
The provisional assets and liabilities recognised as a result of the acquisition are as follows: Fair value of net assets acquired provisional m Fixed assets 262 Intangible assets 322 Inventories 810 Trade and other receivables 146 Deferred tax assets 45 Amounts due from Financial Services customers the loan book 615 1 Other financial assets 59 2 Cash and cash equivalents 548 Total assets acquired 2,807 2 Trade and other payables 1,214 Provisions 104 Defined benefit obligation 454 Total liabilities acquired 1,772 Net identifiable assets acquired at fair value 1,035 Goodwill arising on acquisition 58 Purchase consideration transferred 1,093 1 O ther financial assets includes 9 million of J Sainsbury plc shares converted from Home Retail Group plc own shares at the point of acquisition.
On consolidation these become J Sainsbury plc own shares in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
2 Cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables acquired are both presented gross of the capital return of 226 million.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the acquisition accounting will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date of 2 September 2016. a Intangible assets Intangible assets include a brand of 179 million relating to the Argos brand name.
This reflects its fair value at the acquisition date and is estimated to have a useful economic life of ten years.
b Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables include 40 million of trade receivables, against which a bad debt provision of 1 million is held.
Also included are prepayments and accrued income of 29 million, and other debtors of 78 million.
c Amounts due from Financial Services customers the loan book The loan book fair value of 615 million includes a fair value increase of 20 million and a provision for impairment of 66 million.
d Revenue and profit contribution From the date of acquisition, Home Retail Group has contributed 2,661 million of revenue excluding VAT, 77 million of underlying profit before tax and a statutory profit before tax of 54 million to the Group.
If the acquisition date had been on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been 28,013 million, Group underlying profit before tax would have been 563 million and Group profit before tax would have been 361 million.
These amounts have been calculated using the Groups accounting policies.
The information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the purchase actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group.
e Acquisition-related costs Acquisition-related costs included in administrative expenses and recognised outside of underlying profit amount to 22 million in the current year 2016: 12 million see note 3.
In addition 3 million of costs relating to the issuance of J Sainsbury plc shares have been recognised directly within equity.
f Capital return Prior to the acquisition of Home Retail Group plc, it was announced that Home Retail Group plc shareholders would be entitled to a 226 million capital return comprising the following: 25.0 pence per share, reflecting the 200 million return to shareholders in respect of the sale of Homebase by Home Retail Group plc on 29 February 2016: and 2.8 pence per share totalling 26 million in lieu of a final dividend in respect of Home Retail Group plcs financial year ended 27 February 2016.
This was recorded as a liability in the net assets acquired above within trade and other payables.
The full amount was paid on 12 September 2016.
170 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Acquisition of Home Retail Group plc continued g Cash impact of acquisition m Cash consideration 447 Cash acquired 548 Acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired per cash flow statement 101 h Hindsight adjustments The provisional fair values acquired are different from those reported at the half-year due to hindsight adjustments as permitted under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The goodwill arising as a result of the acquisition has therefore increased from 18 million, as reported at the half-year, to 58 million.
32 Operating lease commitments Accounting policies Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.
a Operating leases Assets leased under operating leases are charged directly to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
b Sale and leaseback A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with the buyer.
For sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from the sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term.
For sale and operating leasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the income statement.
c Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases The Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental increases.
These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
d Operating lease income Operating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements and is recognised as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group leases various retail stores, offices, depots and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Groups future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Aggregate future minimum lease payments: Within one year 760 614 In the second to fifth years inclusive 2,615 2,245 After five years 7,117 7,209 10,492 10,068 Further analysis of the Groups future minimum lease payments after five years is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Aggregate future minimum lease payments: Greater than five years but less than ten years 1,924 1,866 Greater than ten years but less than 15 years 1,253 1,281 After 15 years 3,940 4,062 7,117 7,209 The commercial terms of the Groups operating leases vary, however they commonly include either a market rent review or an index linked rent review with a cap and collar.
The timing of when rent reviews take place differs for each lease.
The Group has pre-emption rights over a minor number of properties, which provides the Group with the right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event the landlord chooses to sell.
The option price payable for the asset in each instance is normally referenced to current market value prevailing at the point of pre-emption.
For the purposes of calculating adjusted net debt, the total value of the Groups capitalised operating lease commitments is 5,938 million 2016: 5,500 million.
Financial Statements 171 32 Operating lease commitments continued The Group sublets certain leased properties: 2017 2016 m m Aggregate future minimum lease receipts: Within one year 39 35 In the second to fifth years inclusive 119 119 After five years 116 124 274 278 33 Capital commitments The Group has entered into contracts totalling 107 million 2016: 173 million for future capital expenditure in relation to property, plant and equipment and 11 million 2016: 6 million for intangible assets not provided for in the financial statements.
34 Financial commitments Sainsburys Bank has off balance sheet commitments to extend credit to customers of 98 million 2016: 77 million.
35 Contingent liabilities The Group has a contingent liability for indemnities arising from the disposal of subsidiaries.
No provision has been recognised on the basis that any potential liability arising is not considered probable.
It is not possible to quantify the impact of this liability with any certainty.
Along with other retailers, the Group is subject to claims in respect of pay rates across supermarket and distribution centre workers.
There is also a potential obligation in respect of holiday pay on voluntary overtime.
The Group is keeping these matters under close review but considers the likelihood of payout to be remote.
