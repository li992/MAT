8 Pensions 8.1 Accounting policies A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and provides no guarantee as to the quantum of retirement benefits that those contributions will ultimately purchase.
A defined benefit scheme is one that is not a defined contribution scheme.
1 Defined benefit schemes Pension scheme assets are valued at fair market value as required by IAS 19.
Pension scheme obligations are an estimate of the amount required to pay the benefits that employees have earned in exchange for current and past service, assessed and discounted to present value using the assumptions shown in note 8.4.
The net pension liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet is the net of the schemes assets and obligations, which are calculated separately for each scheme.
Current service cost is treated as an operating cost in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and Consolidated cash flow statement and is part of underlying earnings.
Net interest income expense is calculated by applying the discount rate on liabilities to the net pension liability or asset adjusted for cash flows over the accounting period and is recognised in finance costs or income and excluded from underlying earnings.
Expenses incurred in respect of the management of scheme assets are included in other comprehensive income as a reduction in the return on scheme assets.
Other scheme expenses are recognised in profit or loss as an operating expense.
Remeasurements comprise of actuarial gains and losses on the obligations and the return on scheme assets excluding interest.
They are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Amounts shown within note 8 are before any adjustments for deferred taxation.
8.2 Defined benefit schemes: Summary and description The Group operates a number of defined benefit retirement schemes together the Schemes providing benefits based on a benefit formula that depends on factors including the employees age and number of years of service.
The Morrison and Safeway Schemes provide pension benefits based on either the employees compensation package and or career average revalued earnings CARE the CARE Schemes.
The CARE Schemes are not open to new members and were closed to future accrual in July 2015.
The RSP is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employees annual earnings in each year, which is revalued each year in line with inflation subject to a cap.
The position of each scheme at 29 January 2017 is as follows: 2017 2016 m m CARE Schemes 293 178 RSP 21 8 Net pension asset 272 186 94 Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 17 8 Pensions continued 8.2 Defined benefit schemes: summary and description continued The disclosures below show the details of the schemes combined: 2017 2017 2016 2016 CARE RSP CARE RSP Balance sheet: m m m m Fair value of scheme assets 4,455 219 3,812 138 Present value of obligations 4,162 240 3,634 130 Net pension asset liability 293 21 178 8 2017 2017 2016 2016 CARE RSP CARE RSP Consolidated statement of comprehensive income m m m m Current service cost recognised in cost of sales 42 21 42 Current service cost recognised in administrative expenses 29 3 20 Administrative costs paid by the Schemes recognised in administrative expenses 3 1 3 1 Curtailment gain 1 3 Net interest on net pension asset finance income 6 2 Total expense credited charged to statement of comprehensive income 4 70 24 63 Statement of other comprehensive income: Remeasurements in other comprehensive income credit charge 101 15 236 The Schemes are registered schemes under the provisions of Schedule 36 of the Finance Act 2004 and the assets are held in legally separate, trusteeadministered funds.
The Board of each scheme is required by law to act in the best interests of the scheme participants within the context of administering the scheme in accordance with the purpose for which the trust was created, and is responsible for setting the investment, funding and governance policies of the fund.
A representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committee meetings in order to provide the Groups view on investment strategy, but the ultimate power lies with the Trustees.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Scheme gives the Trustees the power to set contributions, while in the Safeway Scheme and the RSP this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
8.3 Scheme assets Assets of the Schemes generate returns and ultimately cash that is used to satisfy the Schemes obligations.
They are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The Trustees of each Scheme invest in different categories of asset and with different allocations amongst those categories, according to the investment principles of that Scheme.
Currently, the investment strategy of the CARE Schemes is to maintain a balance of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds, income assets comprising credit investments, corporate bonds and absolute return bonds and protection assets comprising an LDI portfolio, with a weighting towards protection assets.
There are no direct investments in the parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

This is primarily achieved through the use of liability driven investments LDI, whose main goal is to align movements in the value of assets with movements in the Schemes liabilities arising from changes in market conditions.
The Schemes have hedging that broadly covers interest rate movements and inflation movements, as measured on the Trustees funding assumptions which use a discount rate derived from gilt yields.
LDI primarily involves the use of government fixed and inflation linked bonds including re-purchase agreements.
Derivatives such as interest rate and inflation swaps are also used.
There are no annuities or longevity swaps.
Diversified growth funds The Schemes employ diversified growth funds in order to reduce their exposure to equity markets.
These funds typically invest in a range of public and private market assets, including equities, bonds, commodities, property and other assets.
Credit funds The Schemes invest in credit funds in order to improve returns available from their bond assets.
These funds typically lend directly to corporations on a senior secured basis, rather than purchasing debt issued in the public markets.
Absolute return bonds The Schemes employ absolute return bond managers to target a moderate investment return whilst aiming to preserve capital in most market environments.
These funds typically invest in a range of fixed income instruments and derivatives, across different countries and currencies, actively managing their exposure according to their market views and opportunities available.
The movement in the fair value of the Schemes assets over the period was as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 3,812 138 4,050 87 Interest income 138 7 123 3 Return on scheme assets excluding interest 612 20 299 5 Employer contributions 10 56 27 49 Employee contributions 3 1 6 Benefits paid 114 4 87 1 Administrative expenses 3 1 3 1 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 4,455 219 3,812 138 Scottish Limited Partnership The Group has previously entered into a pension funding partnership structure.
In January 2013, Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC made a contribution to the CARE Schemes of 90m.
On the same day, the CARE Schemes invested 90m in the Wm Morrison Property Partnership SLP as a limited partner.
The SLP holds properties which have been leased back to the Group in return for rental income payments.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
As partners in the SLP, the CARE Schemes are entitled to receive a fixed distribution of 6.6m p. a. from the profits of the SLP for 20 years from 2013, subject to certain conditions.
The distributions shared with the Schemes are reflected in the Group financial statements as Employer pension contributions.
In July 2015, the SLP was amended to enhance the security provided to the Schemes by including additional properties.
The terms of these additional properties are such that the CARE Schemes have no entitlement to receive a distribution.
The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP reduce the respective deficits on a funding basis, although the agreements do not affect the position directly on an IAS 19 accounting basis because the investments held by the CARE Schemes do not qualify as assets for IAS 19 purposes.

2 Sensitivity analysis on significant actuarial assumptions The following table summarises the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if each of the significant actuarial assumptions listed above were changed, in isolation, assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice any movement in assumptions could be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net asset liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts below in a number of scenarios.
Extrapolation of the sensitivities shown may not be appropriate.

95 3 76 2 Longevity one year 180 141 8.5 Funding The Morrison Scheme is entirely funded by the parent company and the Safeway Scheme is funded by Safeway Limited and its subsidiaries.
The Groups subsidiaries participate in the RSP.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost between the parent Company and its subsidiaries.
The contribution of each participating subsidiary to the RSP is currently calculated in proportion to the number of employees that are members of the RSP.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at 1 April 2016 for the Safeway Scheme and 5 April 2016 for the Morrison Scheme and the RSP.
The valuations indicated that, on the agreed funding basis, the Safeway, Morrison and RSP Schemes had surpluses of 100m, 1m and 10m respectively.
As a result of these funding positions there are currently no deficit contributions payable.
As such there is no minimum funding requirement in force.
The results of the 2016 actuarial valuations for the CARE Schemes have been used and updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 29 January 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.
For the RSP an actuarial valuation for the purposes of IAS 19, based on member data as at 31 December 2016, has been completed and updated to 29 January 2017 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Schemes expose the Group to inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
In addition, the CARE Schemes expose the Group to longevity risk.
At the year end, schemes in surplus have been disclosed within the assets on the balance sheet.
The Group has taken legal advice with regard to the recognition of a pension surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirement and their interaction.
This advice concluded that recognition of a surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus.
In respect of the RSP this is on the basis that paragraph 11 a of IFRIC 14 applies enabling a refund of surplus during the life of the RSP.
In respect of the Morrison Scheme, this is on the basis that paragraph 11 b or 11 c of IFRIC 14 applies enabling a refund of surplus assuming the gradual settlement of the scheme liabilities over time until all members have left the scheme or the full settlement of the Schemes liabilities in a single event i. e. as a scheme wind up.
In respect of the Safeway Scheme, a refund is available on the basis that paragraph 11 b of IFRIC 14 applies.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Group has considered the proposed new wording to paragraph 12 A of IFRIC 14 concerning whether other parties have a unilateral power to use a schemes surplus to settle in full the schemes liabilities and has concluded that the above accounting treatment should not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised wording to IFRIC 14.
The current best estimate of Group contributions to be paid to the defined benefit schemes for the accounting period commencing 29 January 2017 is 79m 2016: 67m.
This estimate includes amounts payable from the SLP and salary sacrificed contributions from employees.
8.6 Defined contribution scheme set-up costs As previously announced the Group intends to open a new defined contribution pension scheme for colleagues during the accounting period commencing 30 January 2017.
This scheme will become the Auto Enrolment scheme and as such the Group will be liable for backdated contributions for eligible colleagues to 1 October 2012.
The estimated set up costs relating to backdated contributions of 35m were initially recognised in the 52 weeks to 31 January 2016.
The accrual has been updated to 29 January 2017 to reflect a further years contribution for eligible colleagues and changes to accounting assumptions.
