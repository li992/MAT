3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2017 87 Governance and accounts Notes to the accounts continued 1 Operating segments continued The operating segments have been presented to provide additional information on the portfolio segments as well as the geographical areas in which the Group operates.
Under this presentation, the geographical analysis of assets and liabilities for March 2016 has been restated mainly to allocate all derivative instruments against continental Europe to better reect the purpose of the hedging programme.
The Group generated 34.3% 2016: 20.0% of its investment return in the period from investments held in the UK and Ireland and 65.5% 2016: 84.2% of its investment return from investments held in continental Europe.
During the period, the Group generated 91.2% 2016: 99.3% of its investment return from investments in Economic Infrastructure businesses, 8.6% 2016: 4.8% from investments in Projects and 0.2% 2016: 4.1 % from its investment in the India Fund.
Given the nature of the Groups operations, the Group is not considered to be exposed to any operational seasonality or cyclicality that would impact the financial results of the Group during the period or the financial position of the Group at 31 March 2017.

This related to a review of the advisory and performance fees 6,000, due diligence costs in relation to investment transactions 215,656 and work they performed as Reporting Accountants for the capital raise 142,500.
This excludes a fee of 41,000 2016: 39,000 for the Ernst & Young LLP review of the interim financial statements which has been included in the statutory audit fee of 0.3 million in the table above.
In addition, in this financial year and previous years, and in line with the Companys policy, Ernst & Young LLP provided non-audit services to support the transaction activity conducted by the Group during the year in relation to certain non-consolidated investee companies.
However, the fees received by Ernst & Young LLP did not represent a significant portion of the total investment transaction costs 2016: same.
The fees for these services are ordinarily borne by the underlying investee companies or unconsolidated subsidiaries and therefore are not included in the expenses of the Group.
TheCompanys policy for engaging the auditor for non-audit services is set out on page 65.

3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2017 89 Governance and accounts Notes to the accounts continued 7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted and in active markets Quoted equity investments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable Derivative financial instruments held at fair value in the market either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted investments and unlisted funds For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing the categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole for each reporting period.
At 31 March 2017, the Group held the following classes of financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
For all other assets and liabilities their carrying value approximates to fair value.
During the year ended 31 March 2017, there were no transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair value hierarchy 2016: none.

The holding period of the investments in the portfolio is expected to be greater than one year.
Therefore investments are classied as non-current unless there is an agreement to dispose of the investment within one year and all relevant regulatory approvals have been received.
It is not possible to identify with certainty where any investments may be sold within one year.
Unquoted investments The Group invests in private companies which are not quoted on an active market.
These are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted investments can be found in the Portfolio valuation methodology section.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets together where they will be managed and valued as a single investment, were invested at the same time and cannot be realised separately.
As at 31 March 2017, the fair value of unquoted investments was 1,788.3 million 2016: 1,203.8 million.
Individual portfolio asset valuations are shown within the Portfolio summary on page 18.
The majority of the assets held within Level 3 are valued on a discounted cash ow basis, hence, the valuations are sensitive to the discount rate assumed in the valuation of each asset.
Other significant unobservable inputs include the long-term ination rate assumption and interest rates assumption used to project the future cash ows.
A discussion of discount rates applied can be found on page 23.
Increasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 167.4 million 2016: 124.7 million.
Decreasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 200.1 million 2016: 151.1 million.
The majority of assets held within Level 3 have revenues that are linked, partially linked or in some way correlated to ination.
The long-term ination rate assumptions for the country of domicile of the investments in the portfolio range from 5.0% India 2016: 5.0% to 2.0% Finland 2016: 2.0% including the UK at 2.5% UK RPI 2016: 2.5%.
Changing the ination rate assumption may result in consequential changes to other assumptions used in the valuation of each asset.
The impact of increasing the ination rate assumption by 1% for the next two years would increase the value of the portfolio by 41.3 million 2016: 29.1 million.
Decreasing the ination rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% for the next two years would decrease the value of the portfolio by 40.9 million 2016: 28.2 million.
The valuations are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which may result from: i unhedged existing borrowings within portfolio companies: ii interest rates on uncommitted future borrowings assumed within the asset valuations: and iii cash deposits held by portfolio companies.
These comprise a wide range of interest rates from short-term deposit rates to longer-term borrowing rates across a broad range of debt products.
Increasing the cost of borrowing assumption for unhedged borrowings and any future uncommitted borrowing and the cash deposit rates used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 111.6 million 2016: 90.0 million.
Decreasing the interest rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 114.0 million 2016: 86.8 million.
This calculation does not take account of any offsetting variances which may be expected to prevail if interest rates changed, the most significant impact would be in the portfolio assets with regulated returns where the future allowed return may also be inuenced by the interest rate.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2017 91 Governance and accounts Notes to the accounts continued 7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments continued Unlisted funds The Company invests in one externally managed fund, The Dalmore Capital Fund, which is not quoted in an active market.
The Company considered the valuation techniques and inputs used in valuing this fund to ensure they are reasonable and appropriate and therefore the net asset value NAV of this fund may be used as an input into measuring its fair value.
In measuring this fair value, the NAV of the fund is adjusted, as necessary, to reect restrictions on redemptions, future commitments, illiquid nature of the investments and other specic factors of the fund and fund manager.
The Company classies the fair value of this investment as Level 3.
As at 31 March 2017, the fair value of unlisted funds was 17.6 million 2016: 18.3 million.
The fund NAV reects a 31 March 2017 valuation date 2016: 31 March 2016 valuation date.
A 10% adjustment in the fair value of the fund would result in a 1.8 million 2016: 1.8 million change in the valuation.
Intermediate holding companies The Company invests in a number of intermediate holding companies that are used to hold the unquoted investments, valued as referred to above.
All other assets and liabilities of the intermediate holding companies are held either at fair value or a reasonable approximation to fair value.
The fair value of these intermediate holding companies therefore approximates to their NAV and the Company classies the fair value as Level 3.
As at 31 March 2017, the fair value of the other assets and liabilities within these intermediate holding companies was 9.7 million 2016: 6.7 million.
Over-the-counter derivatives The Company uses over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives and interest rate swaps to hedge foreign currency movements and interest rates respectively.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
The valuation technique incorporates various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves, and uses present value calculations.
For these financial instruments, significant inputs into models are market observable and are included within Level 2.
Valuation process for Level 3 valuations Valuations are the responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company.
The valuation of unquoted investments, debt and unlisted funds held by the Group is performed on a half-yearly basis by the valuation team of the Investment Adviser and reviewed by the Investment Committee of the Investment Adviser.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed within the valuation team.
The valuation team veries the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant documents and market information.
On a half-yearly basis, the Investment Committee presents the valuations to the Board.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments and investments with significant fair value changes.
The Investment Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs, and may request that alternative valuation methods are applied to support the valuation arising from the method chosen.
Any changes in valuation methods are discussed and agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee before being approved by the Board.

92 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Governance and accounts 9 Financial risk management A full review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk report on page 46.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk report where applicable and providing further quantitative data on specic financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a consistent investment approval process.
The Boards Investment Committee and the Investment Advisers investment process are part of the overall risk management framework of the Group.
The funding objective of the Group is that each category of investment ought to be broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets, and that funding needs are tobe met ahead of planned investment.
Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowing facilities and shareholders equity.
The Companys Articles require its outstanding borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support subsequent obligations, to be limited to 50% of the gross assets of the Group.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in Note 11 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
The Company is regulated under the provisions of the Collective Investment Funds Jersey Law 1988 as a closed-ended collective investment fund and is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum levelof capital.
Capital is allocated for investment in utilities, communications, transportation, natural resources and social infrastructure across the UK, continental Europe and Asia, as described on page 4.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is currently 25% of gross assets including cash holdings at the time of investment.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on the debt component of its unquoted investments, cash, deposits, derivative contracts and receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk as a result of counterparty default equates to the current carrying value of these financial assets.
Throughout the year and the prior year, the Groups cash and deposits were held with a variety of counterparties, principally in AAA rated money market funds, as well as in short-term bank deposits with a minimum of a single Acredit rating.
The counterparties selected for the derivative financial instruments were all banks with a minimum of a single Acredit rating with at least one major rating agency.
The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and is reected through fair value movements.
The performance of underlying investments is monitored by the Board to assess future recoverability.
For those assets and income entitlements that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company has failed and there is no expectation to recover any residual value from the investment, the Groups policy is to record an impairment for the full amount of the loan.
Impairments are made when the net present value of the future cash ows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups investment.
Inthese cases an impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
No other assets held by the Group were considered to be impaired.
The Company had no loans or receivables or debt investments considered past due 2016: nil.
The Company actively manages counterparty risk.
Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review of counterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group did not consider itself to have a significant exposure to any one counterparty and held deposits and derivative contracts with a number of different counterparties to reduce counterparty risk.
Due to the size and nature of the investment portfolio there is concentration risk due to the size of the investments.
This risk is managed by diversifying the portfolio by sector and geography.
The risk exposure at this year end has reduced compared to the prior year end following the new investments during the year.

All derivatives are settled net and therefore the liability shown is the net cash ow expected to be paid on settlement.
The financial commitments relate to the Groups commitments to the 3i India Infrastructure Fund, Mersey Gateway Bridge, A9, RIVM, La Sant and Condorcet projects and the new investments in Valorem, Hart van Zuid and A27 A1 projects.
During the year, the Group invested in Ayrshire College and the A12 project and, as a result, a prior year financial commitment of 8.8 million was extinguished.
In order to manage the contractual liquidity risk the Group is not dependent on the cash ows from financial assets as it has free cash and debt facilities in place.
Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio, but the valuation of the portfolio and the carrying value of other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and market price uctuations.
The Groups sensitivities to these uctuations are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk report section.
An increase of 250 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2016: 250 basis points would lead to an approximate decrease in net assets and to the net profit of the Group of 2.1 million 2016: increase of 1.2 million.
Thisexposure relates principally to changes in interest receivable on cash on deposit held at the year end and on interest paid on drawn amounts from the Revolving Credit Facility.
The average cash balance of the Group during the year was 121.7 million 2016: 141.9 million and the weighted average interest earned was 0.3% 2016: 0.5%.
The risk exposure at this year end has increased compared to the prior year end following the drawdown of cash from the Revolving Credit Facility.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate uctuations as disclosed in Note 7.
This risk is considered a component of market price risk described in section iii.
The Group does not hold any xed rate debt investments or borrowings and is therefore not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
94 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Governance and accounts 9 Financial risk management continued ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk report.
The currency denominations of the Groups net assets are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
As at 31 March 2017 1 Sterling Euro US dollar DKK Total m m m m m Net assets 737.4 838.3 41.2 117.7 1,734.6 Sensitivity analysis Assuming a 10% appreciation in sterling against the euro, DKK and US dollar exchange rates: Impact of exchange movements on net profit and net assets 100.5 76.2 3.7 10.7 9.9 1 Sterling impact relates to the impact of fair value movement in derivatives held by the Company to hedge foreign currency uctuations in the valuation of the investment portfolio.
As at 31 March 2016 1 Sterling Euro US dollar DKK Total m m m m m Net assets 539.4 564.1 53.2 120.3 1,277.0 Sensitivity analysis Assuming a 10% appreciation in sterling against the euro, DKK and US dollar exchange rates: Impact of exchange movements on net profit and net assets 79.1 51.3 4.8 10.9 12.1 1 Sterling impact relates to the impact of fair value movement in derivatives held by the Company to hedge foreign currency uctuations in the valuation of the investment portfolio.
The impact of an equivalent depreciation in sterling against the euro, DKK and US dollar exchange rates has the inverse impact on net profit and net assets from that shown above.
There is an indirect exposure to the rupee through the investment in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund which is denominated in US dollars but it is only the direct exposure that is considered here.
The risk exposure at the year end is considered to be representative of this year as a whole.
iii Market price risk Further information about the management of external market risk and its impact on market price or valuation, which arises principally from unquoted investments, is provided in the Risk report.
A 10% increase in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on net profit and net assets.

The risk exposure at the year end is considered to be representative of this year asa whole.
By the nature of the Groups activities, it has large exposures to individual assets that are susceptible to movements in price.
This risk concentration is managed within the Companys investment strategy as discussed in the Risk report.

The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken through profit or loss.
As at 31 March 2017, the notional amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts held by the Company was 1,027.6 million 2016: 810.0 million.
Interest rate swaps The Company uses interest rate swaps to minimise the effect of uctuations in interest rates on the value of expected future cash payments payable on debt obligations resulting from non-recourse borrowings made by Oystercatcher Luxco 2 S. r. l. an unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company.
The fair value of these swaps is recorded in the balance sheet.
No swaps are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken through profit or loss.
As at 31 March 2017, the notional amount of the interest rate swap contracts held by the Company was 68.4 million 2016: 63.3 million.
Interest payments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility are unhedged.
Fair value of derivatives The Company holds its over-the-counter derivatives at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
The valuation technique incorporates various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and uses present value calculations.
