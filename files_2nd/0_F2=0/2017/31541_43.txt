New Covent Garden Market The first parcel of land at Nine Elms, London, was released to VSM NCGM Limited during the year ended 30 November 2017 and was subsequently sold.
The remaining liability to establish New Covent Garden Market continues to have a significant impact on the results and net assets of the Groups joint ventures.
Following the disposal during the year of the first parcel of land, the Group has undertaken a full review of the remaining works required to establish the market.
The complicated nature of working on a site with a live market and an anticipated extended duration of the project have resulted in an increase in expected construction costs.
Accordingly, VSM NCGM Limited increased its liability for the estimate of this forecast cost, with the Groups share of this increase being 24.6m.
Investment property within VSM NCGM Limited was valued at 30 November 2017 and 30 November 2016 by Jones Lang LaSalle LLP, Chartered Surveyors, in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, on the basis of market value.
Jones Lang LaSalle LLP are professionally qualified independent external valuers and had appropriate recent experience in the relevant location and category of the property being valued.
The liability of VSM NCGM Limited to establish a new market facility for CGMA has been calculated by: the Board of VSM NCGM Limited, including representatives of VINCI and St. Modwen, assessing the costs of procuring the market facility at current rates: applying a current estimate of inflation for the period of the build of 2.5%: and discounting the forecast cash flows to todays value using a discount rate of 5%, considered by the Board of VSM NCGM Limited to appropriately reflect the risks and rewards of the procurement.
