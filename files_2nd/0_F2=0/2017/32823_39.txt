SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS ENTITY-WIDE DISCLOSURES The Groups primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions, therefore all revenue is attributed to a single group of similar products and services.
It is not meaningful to separate this group into further categories of products.
Revenue is recognised where the service is provided.
The Group has a diversified customer base and no single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
