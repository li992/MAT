NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ELEMENTIS PLC FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Elementis plc is a public company limited by shares and is incorporated and domiciled in England.
The address of its registered office is Caroline House, 55-57 High Holborn, London, WC1V 6DX.
The principal activity of the Company is to act as an investment and holding company.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The Companys financial statements have been prepared in compliance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced disclosure framework Disclosure exemptions from EU-adopted IFRS for qualifying entities FRS 101, and with the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has presented its results under FRS101.
The last financial statements under the UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2015.
As a consequence of the majority of the Companys assets, liabilities and expenses originating in UK pound sterling, the Company has chosen the UK pound sterling as its reporting currency.
TRANSITION TO FRS 101 The date of transition to FRS 101 was 31 December 2013.
Having considered the Companys ability to recover any deferred tax assets that might be associated with the share option reserve, it was determined that it would not be appropriate to recognise such an asset.
As such, there are no reconciling items between the previously disclosed accounts for 2014 and the restated accounts prepared under FRS 101.
The transition to FRS 101 has not affected the reported financial position and financial performance.
As such no equity reconciliations between UK GAAP and FRS 101 at the transition and comparative dates have been presented.
As a qualifying entity whose results are consolidated in the Elementis plc Consolidated financial statements on pages 90 to 129, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemption requirements of FRS 101 regarding the requirement to prepare a statement of cashflows and certain financial instrument, share based pay and key management personnel compensation disclosures.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The Company has adopted FRS 101 in these financial statements.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments Investments in Group undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less impairment.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Company participates in the Elementis Group defined benefit pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
Details of the latest actuarial valuation carried out in September 2014 can be found in the 2016 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts.
Following the introduction of the revised reporting standard, any surplus or deficit in the Elementis Group defined benefit pension scheme is to be reported in the financial statements of Elementis Holdings Ltd, which employs the majority of active members of the scheme and is responsible for making deficit contributions under the current funding plan.
Taxation Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Advance corporation tax recoverable by deduction from future corporation tax is carried forward within deferred taxation or as ACT recoverable within debtors as appropriate.
There were no significant judgements or estimates necessary in 2017.
132 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Share based payments The fair value of share options granted to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises in its individual financial statements an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share based payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a.
They include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company.
Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that the definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders funds, are dealt with as appropriations in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
PROFIT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
