com 88 Report and Accounts December 2017 RIT Capital Partners plc RIT Capital Partners plc Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 247149 RIT R&A Cover 26 02 2018 11:05 Page 1 for the year ended 31 December 2017 Warning to Shareholders From time to time investment companies and their shareholders can be the subject of investment scams.
The perpetrators obtain lists of shareholders and make unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters, typically from overseas.
They may offer to sell worthless or high risk shares or, in the case of your RIT Capital Partners plc stock, may offer to buy your current shareholdings at an unrealistic price.
They will often also inform you of untrue scenarios to make you think that you need to sell your shares or to justify an offer that seems too good to be true.
To find out more about share fraud or boiler room scams please visit the website of the Financial Conduct Authority.

In the event that you are contacted we strongly recommend that you review the FCA website above and follow the necessary steps.
