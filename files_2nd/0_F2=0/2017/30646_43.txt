138 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 11 Earnings per share Accounting policy With effect from 6 April 2016, the UK government abolished tax credits on dividends paid after this date, including the 2015 final dividend, which was paid in May 2016.
As a result of the abolition of this credit, dividends and therefore earnings per share are equal for both RELX PLC and RELX NV.
Earnings per share is calculated by taking the reported net profit attributable to shareholders and dividing this by the total weighted average number of shares.
In calculating earnings per share of the Group up until the end of 2015 prior to the abolition of the tax credit, the earnings for each class of share were calculated on the basis that earnings are fully distributed.
The Groups usual practice is for only a portion of earnings to be distributed by way of dividends.
Until the end of 2015, dividends paid to RELX PLC and RELX NV shareholders were, other than in special circumstances, equalised at the gross level inclusive of the prevailing UK tax credit available to certain RELX PLC shareholders.
The allocation of earnings between the RELX PLC shares and the RELX NV shares reected the differential in dividend payments declared as a result of the tax credit, with the balance of earnings assumed to be distributed as a capital distribution, in equal amounts per share.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted net profit attributable to shareholders by the total weighted average number of shares for the Group.
