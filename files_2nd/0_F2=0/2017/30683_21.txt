Additionally, there was a $472m benefit to the tax rate, reflecting the favourable impact of UK Patent Box profits: the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses: and reductions in tax provisions and provision to return adjustments arising on the expiry of statute of limitations and favourable progress of discussions with tax authorities.
Absent these benefits, the tax rate for the year would have been 22%.
The cash tax paid for the year was $454m which was 20% of profit before tax.
Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements.
The 2017 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies totalling $105m and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2016 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies totalling $67m and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2015 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to a $186m tax benefit following agreement of US federal tax liabilities of open years to 2008, net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies totalling $259m and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2017 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to return adjustments.
The 2016 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to return adjustments and releases in provisions for tax contingencies.
The 2015 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to return adjustments.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double tax relief if distributed as dividends.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $8,359m at 31 December 2017 2016: $6,884m: 2015: $6,957m.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
In December 2017, the US tax regime was reformed through enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
This included a substantial reduction to the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% along with other changes.
Details of the material tax exposures and items currently under audit, negotiation and review are set out in Note 28.

The impact on differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Group's overall tax charge is noted above.
Profits arising from our manufacturing operation in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under a tax incentive grant continuing until 2031.

150 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
AstraZeneca's biopharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
All of these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
These individual functional areas are not managed separately.
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the management, development and performance of our business.
It is considered that the SET is AstraZeneca's chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8.
The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply.
In addition to the CEO, CFO, the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer, the SET comprises ten Executive Vice Presidents representing IMED, MedImmune, Global Medicines Development, North America, Europe, International & GPPS, Asia Pacific, Oncology, Operations & Information Technology, and Human Resources.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole.
Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision.
For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub team for implementation.
The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, the Group's IFRS Financial Statements.
The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product.
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group's Early Stage Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee.
Geographic areas The following tables show information by geographic area and, for Total Revenue and property, plant and equipment, material countries.
The figures show the Total Revenue, operating profit and profit before tax made by companies located in that area country, together with segment assets, segment assets acquired, net operating assets, and property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies: export sales and the related profit are included in the area country where the legal entity resides and from which those sales were made.

As a further check, we also perform a discounted cash flow calculation whereby we risk adjust projections of the Groups post-tax cash flows over 10 years.
This length of time is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of populations in our established markets and the expanding patient populations in newer markets, our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10-year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budget and forecast amounts.
No terminal value is included as the recoverable amount determined by the cash flows exceed the carrying value of net assets without inclusion of a terminal value.
AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2017, 2016 and 2015 is used in the calculation to discount the cash flows to reflect the impact of risks relevant to the Group and the time value of money.
No goodwill impairment was identified.

Recoverable amount is determined on a fair value less cost to sell basis using a discounted cash flow calculation level 3 in the fair value hierarchy where the products expected post-tax cash flows are risk-adjusted over their estimated remaining useful economic life.
The projections are covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
The risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2017, 2016 and 2015.
The estimates used in calculating the recoverable amount are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Groups activities including: outcome of R&D activities: probability of technical and regulatory success: market share and pricing: amount and timing of projected future cash flows: and sales erosion curves following patent expiry.
At 31 December 2017, the Group recorded an impairment charge of $491m in respect of launched products Byetta $92m, revised carrying value of $407m, FluMist $121m, revised carrying value of $267m and Movantik $174m, revised carrying value of $106m, and products in development which were fully written off, tralokinumab $53m and other intangible assets $51m.
The impairments recorded on the launched products were a consequence of revised market share assumptions and, for FluMist, the US market expected timing of renewed recommendation.
Impairments recorded on products in development were a consequence of failed or poor performing trials.
No impairment charge has been recorded on Verinurad, a product in development, with a net book value of $1,172m.
The valuation is particularly sensitive to variations in the probability of technical and regulatory success PTRS assumptions.
To illustrate this, sensitivities performed at the 156 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 9 Intangible assets continued year end to vary to PTRS assumptions in the Groups valuation model included reducing the PTRS by 5 percentage points.
Assuming all other assumptions remain constant, applying the sensitivity would result in an impairment charge of approximately $300m.
As detailed in Note 25, we have recognised significant intangible assets for late stage development programmes and launched products on business combinations at their fair value at acquisition.

The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in China, Dizhe Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Co. Limited.
AstraZeneca contributed $55m in initial funds and has a 48% interest in the joint venture.
The joint venture entity purchased exclusive rights from AstraZeneca in 2017 to develop and commercialise three potential medicines currently in pre-clinical development in the areas of oncology, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and respiratory, resulting in a disposal gain of $28m for AstraZeneca recognised in other operating income.
In 2015, AstraZeneca established the subsidiaries Entasis Therapeutics Ltd and Entasis Therapeutics Inc. collectively known as Entasis for the development of early-stage infection assets.
In March 2016, Entasis closed a Series B financing, raising $25m from four third party investors.
Under the funding agreement, a new board of directors was appointed, and a voting rights agreement was put in place committing to reduce AstraZenecas voting interest to approximately 49%.
The results of Entasis were consequently deconsolidated in 2016 from the Group with an investment in associate of $24m recognised.
There was no gain or loss recognised on deconsolidation.
During 2017, the voting interests were further reduced and at 31 December 2017 were approximately 18%.
On 1 December 2015, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co. Ltd. to develop a biosimilar using the combined capabilities of the two parties.
The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in the UK, Centus Biotherapeutics Limited.
AstraZeneca contributed $45m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 50% interest in the joint venture.
An additional contribution of $10m was made in 2016 and additional contributions totalling $20m were made in 2017.
On 30 April 2014, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung Biologics Co. Ltd. to develop a biosimilar using the combined capabilities of the two parties.
The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in the UK, Archigen Biotech Limited, with a branch in South Korea.
AstraZeneca contributed $70m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 50% interest in the joint venture.
An additional contribution of $30m was made in 2016.
All investments are accounted for using the equity method.

Equity securities and bonds available for sale are held at fair value.
The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
Fixed deposits are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value given their short-term nature.
None of the financial assets have been reclassified in the year.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses equity securities and bonds available for sale, contained within Other investments and carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

None of the derivatives have been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are estimated by cash flow accounting models using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Derivatives 1.7% to 2.2% 1.5% to 2.2% 1.2% to 2.1% 13 Non-current other receivables Non-current other receivables of $847m 2016: $901m: 2015: $907m include a prepayment of $180m 2016: $380m: 2015: $617m which represents the long-term element of minimum contractual royalties payable to Shionogi under the global licence agreement for Crestor, which was renegotiated in December 2013.
The resulting modified royalty structure, which includes fixed minimum and maximum payments in years until 2020, has resulted in the Group recognising liabilities, and corresponding prepayments, for the discounted value of total minimum payments.
The current portion of the prepayment is $181m 2016: $116m: 2015: $260m and is reported in amounts due within one year see Note 15.
Non-current other receivables also include $178m 2016: $178m: 2015: $158m prepayments in relation to our research collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics and $175m 2016: $175m: 2015: $nil receivable related to the disposal of the small molecule antibiotics assets in 2016.

2 Instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss include the US dollar 7% guaranteed debentures repayable in 2023.
3 Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge include the euro 0.25%, euro 0.75% and euro 1.25% Callable bonds repayable in 2021, 2024 and 2028 respectively.
4 Included within borrowings held at amortised cost are amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,054m 2016: $1,208m: 2015: $1,327m held at amortised cost.
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value: this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11, with the exception of overdrafts and finance leases, where fair value approximates to carrying values.
A loss of $9m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to decreased credit risk.
A gain of $27m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk.
Under IFRS 9 the Group records the effect of the losses and gains, arising from own credit risk, on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss in Other comprehensive income.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group Financial Statements.

20 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution DC, where the Company contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit DB, where benefits are based on employees length of service and linked to their salary.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees representatives, the Company introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The number of active members in the Fund continues to decline and is now below 900 employees.
In November 2017, the Company decided to close both the qualified and non-qualified US pension plans to future accrual effective from 31 December 2017.
The legacy DB participants are eligible for DC benefits from 1 January 2018.
In addition, the eligibility criteria to qualify for benefits within the US post-retirement welfare plan was also changed effective from 1 November 2017.
Further information on the financial impact of these changes is set out later in this section.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through separate,  assets.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special Company payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets are sufficient to meet future obligations as and when they fall due.
The funding level is monitored rigorously by the Company and local fiduciaries taking into account: the Companys credit rating, local regulation, cash flows and the solvency and maturity of the relevant pension scheme.
164 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Financing principles Ninety two per cent of the Companys defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2017 are in schemes within the UK, the US and Sweden.
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded in line with the Companys financing principles.
There have been no fundamental changes to these principles during 2017.
The Company believes: in funding the benefits it promises to employees and meeting its obligations.
that the pension arrangements should be considered in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general, it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding when the Company might use the capital elsewhere to reinvest in the wider business, nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
in taking some measured and rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a long-term plan to reduce those risks when opportunities arise.
that holding certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
However, the Company would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
that proactive engagement with local Fiduciary Bodies is necessary and helpful to provide robust oversight and input in relation to funding and investment strategy and to facilitate liability management exercises appropriate to each pension plan.
in considering the use of alternative methods of providing security that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Company.
These principles are appropriate at the present date but they are kept under ongoing review: should circumstances change these principles may also be subject to change.
The Company has developed a long-term funding framework to implement these principles, which targets full funding on a low risk funding measure over the long term as the pension funds mature, with affordable long-term fide-risking of investment strategy over time.
Unless local regulation dictates otherwise, this framework determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds.
UK The UK defined benefit pension fund represents approximately 64% of the Companys defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2017.
The financing principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements summarised below and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
Role of Trustees UK The UK Pension Fund is governed and administered by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustee Directors are comprised of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees, and include an independent professional Trustee Director.
The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy and the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund see below.
Funding requirements UK UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently ie to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
On a triennial basis, the Trustee and the Company must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Fund is fully funded over an appropriate time period and on a suitable prudent measure.
The last full actuarial valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2016 and following discussions between the Company and Trustee was finalised and accepted by The Pensions Regulator in 2017.
The next actuarial valuation is due to take place as at 31 March 2019.
In relation to deficit recovery contributions, a lump sum contribution of 51m $64m was made in March 2017, with a further 51m contribution due before 31 March 2018.
In addition, a further contribution of 25.2m is also due before 31 March 2018 in relation to part payment of the deferred contribution explained below.
During 2017, the Company provided a letter of credit to the Trustee, to underwrite the deferral of an additional deficit recovery contribution payment of approximately 126m which was due in 2017.
This contribution will now be paid in five equal instalments from March 2018 to March 2022.
The letter of credit underwriting these payments will be renewed each year, but will reduce in value as each annual payment is made.
The Company entered into a long-term funding agreement with the Trustee in October 2016 under which the Company will grant a charge in favour of the Trustee over the new Cambridge Biomedical Campus, upon practical completion, which would crystallise only in the event of the Companys insolvency.
This charge will provide security in respect of future UK Pension Fund contributions.
Under the funding assumptions used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions from the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2016 were as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 2.6% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010, pension increases at 2.85% per annum and discount rate at 3.71% per annum.
The resulting valuation of the Funds liabilities on that basis were 5,265m $7,091m compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2016 of 4,492m $6,050m.
Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to the Company by refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the Fund.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Liability Management Exercises UK During 2017, the Company completed a Pensions Increase Exchange PIE exercise.
This exercise, which commenced in 2016, offered certain pensioner members the option of taking a higher amount of pension right away, in exchange for giving up any potential future inflation linked increases on all, or part of their pension.
A credit to the income statement was recognised in 2016 in respect of this exercise of 54m $74m, in Operating Project.
No such credit was recognised in 2017.
AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 165 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Regulation UK The UK pensions market is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, www.
Rest of Group The IAS 19 positions for the US and Sweden as at 31 December 2017 are shown below.
These plans account for 28% of the Groups defined benefit obligations.
The US and Sweden pension funds are governed by Fiduciary Bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of those funds.
These plans are funded in line with the Companys financing principles and contributions are paid as prescribed by the long-term funding framework.
As earlier mentioned, the Company announced changes to retirement benefit plans in the US in November 2017.
Both the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans closed to future accrual ie were frozen, effective 31 December 2017, and changes in eligibility criteria were made for the post-retirement welfare plan effective 1 November 2017.
These changes triggered curtailment gains totalling $92m on remeasurement of the future liabilities and which, under the rules of IAS 19, are recognised immediately in the Income statement.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2017, when plan obligations were $1,708m and plan assets were $1,603m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2017, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $1,811m and plan assets were $1,146m.
On current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions during the year ending 31 December 2018 for the three main countries will be approximately $68m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2017, some 3,338 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 2,833 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2017 was $14m 2016: $17m: 2015: $23m.
Plan assets were $290m and plan obligations were $279m at 31 December 2017.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2017.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2017 2016 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.1% 2.2% 3.2% 2.1% 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.1% 3.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0% 0.9% 2.9% 1.1% 2 2 Discount rate defined benefit obligation 2.5% 3.0% 2.7% 3.3% 2 3 3 Discount rate interest cost 2.5% 2.7% N A N A 2 3 3 Discount rate service cost 2.7% 3.5% N A N A 1 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
2 Group defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2017 calculated using discount rates based on market conditions as at 31 December 2017.
3 2017 interest costs and service costs calculated using discount rates based on market conditions as at 31 December 2016.
The weighted average duration of the post-retirement scheme obligations in the UK is 17 years and 15 years in the Rest of Group.
Discount rate and methodology changes In 2016, the Companys discount rates were based on yields on long-term AA-rated fixed income instruments, using a single discount rate for each pension plan to value the defined benefit obligations, service cost and interest cost.
As stated last year, from January 2017, for the largest plans, the Company moved to a multiple discount rate approach.
This has resulted in separate discount rates for defined benefit obligations, service cost and interest cost.
The change has impacted on the measurement of the service and interest cost items in 2017.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2017 and male members expected to retire in 2037 2016: 2016 and 2036 respectively.

There is a framework in place to gradually increase the level of interest rate hedging to 100% of assets over time, via a combination of liability management exercises and additional market-based hedging.
Note that there are some differences in the bonds and instruments held by the UK Pension Fund to hedge interest rate risk on the statutory and longterm funding basis gilts and swaps and the bonds analysed to set the DBO discount rate on an accounting basis AA corporate bonds.
As such, there remains some mismatching risk on an accounting basis should yields on gilts and swaps diverge compared to corporate bonds ie the credit spread between gilts and corporate bonds narrows.

Life expectancy The majority of the UK Pension Funds obligations The UK Pension Fund entered into a longevity swap are to provide benefits for the life of the member, during 2013 which provides hedging against the so increases in life expectancy will result in an longevity risk of increasing life expectancy over the increase in the liabilities.
next 76 years for around 10,000 of the UK Pension Funds current pensioners and covers $2.4bn of the UK Pension Funds liabilities.
A one-year increase in life expectancy will result in a $244m increase in pension fund assets.
Other risks There are a number of other risks of running the UK Pension Fund including counterparty risks from using derivatives mitigated by using a diversified range of counterparties of high standing and ensuring positions are collateralised daily.
Furthermore, there are operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits and legislative risks such as the government increasing the burden on pension funds through new legislation.
These are mitigated so far as possible via the governance structure in place which oversees and administers the pension funds.
The Companys pension plans in the US and Sweden also manage these key risks, where they are relevant, in a similar manner, operating a diversified growth portfolio and a framework to hedge interest rate risk.
Post-retirement scheme deficit The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Company at 31 December 2017, as calculated in accordance with IAS 19, are shown overleaf.
The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 169 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Rate sensitivities The following table shows the US dollar effect of a change in the significant actuarial assumptions used to determine the retirement benefits obligations in our three main defined benefit pension obligation countries.
2 Of the $337m increase, $244m is covered by the longevity swap.
3 Of the $337m decrease, $236m is covered by the longevity swap.
The sensitivity to the financial assumptions shown above has been estimated taking into account the approximate duration of the liabilities and the overall profile of the plan membership.
The sensitivity to the life expectancy assumption has been estimated based on the distribution of the plan cash flows.

V. and its subsidiaries.
The following summarised financial information, for Acerta Pharma B. V. and its subsidiaries, is presented on a stand-alone basis since the acquisition date, and before the impact of Group-related adjustments, some of which are incorporated into this calculation of the loss attributable to the non-controlling interests: 2017 2016 $m $m Total Revenue Profit loss after tax 412 212 Other comprehensive income Total comprehensive income loss 412 212 2017 2016 $m $m Non-current assets 3 73 Current assets 904 79 Total assets 907 152 Current liabilities 417 171 171 Total liabilities 417 Net assets liabilities 490 19 2017 2016 $m $m Net cash inflow outflow from operating activities 5 223 Net cash inflow from investing activities 139 Increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the year 5 84 The non-controlling interest in Acerta Pharma is subject to a put option, exercisable by the minority shareholders at certain points in the future, not earlier than the commercial launch of Calquence acalabrutinib.
This put option gives rise to a liability which is recorded at the present value of the expected redemption amount, calculated using a probability-weighted model based on forecast revenue and earnings of Acerta Pharma, and is recorded within Non-current other payables see Note 18.
The forecast revenue and earnings of Acerta Pharma will particularly be affected by the outcome of ongoing clinical trials and regulatory submissions relating to Calquence.
If actual earnings are lower than forecast, the liability for the put option will decrease.
Similarly, if actual earnings are higher than forecast, the liability for the put option will increase.
The value of the liability is also sensitive to the expected timing of exercise.
The amount of the liability is not directly correlated to time until the expected date of exercise.
During the year, Calquence received regulatory approval in the US for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma MCL who have received at least one prior therapy.
This approval has changed the weighted probability of certain outcomes in respect of the forecast earnings of Acerta Pharma and has brought forward the weighted average expected exercise date of the put option.
The changes to these assumptions resulted in a decrease in the liability for the year before the effect of interest costs.
172 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 25 Acquisitions of business operations 2017 Acquisitions There were no acquisitions of business operations in 2017.
2016 Acquisitions Acerta Pharma On 2 February 2016, AstraZeneca completed an agreement to invest in a majority equity stake in Acerta Pharma, a privately-owned biopharmaceutical company based in the Netherlands and US.
The transaction provides AstraZeneca with a potential best-in-class irreversible oral Brutons tyrosine kinase BTK inhibitor, Calquence, currently in Phase III development for B-cell blood cancers and in Phase I II clinical trials in multiple solid tumours.
Acerta Pharma has approximately 150 employees.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca has acquired 55% of the issued share capital of Acerta Pharma for an upfront payment of $2.5bn.
A further payment of $1.5bn was due either on receipt of the first regulatory approval for Calquence for any indication in the US, or the end of 2018, depending on which was first.
This was paid in 2017 on receipt of first regulatory approval in the US.
The agreement also includes options which, if exercised, provide the opportunity for Acerta Pharmas shareholders to sell, and AstraZeneca to buy, the remaining 45% of shares in Acerta Pharma.
The options can be exercised at various points in time, conditional on the first approval of Calquence in both the US and Europe and when the extent of the commercial opportunity has been fully established, at a price of approximately $3bn net of certain costs and payments incurred by AstraZeneca and net of agreed future adjusting items, using a pre-agreed pricing mechanism.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a Swedish krona functional currency subsidiary.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the US dollar denominated liabilities arising from the transaction.
To manage this foreign currency risk these liabilities have been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of the Groups underlying US dollar net investments.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
AstraZenecas 55% holding is a controlling interest and Acerta Pharmas combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their operating processes requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Goodwill is principally attributable to the value of the specialist know-how inherent in the acquired workforce and the accounting for deferred taxes.
Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acerta Pharmas results have been consolidated into the Groups results from 2 February 2016.
From the period from acquisition to 31 December 2016, Acerta Pharma had no revenues and its loss after tax was $212m.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2016, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2016 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $3,367m.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2016 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
The fair values assigned to the Acerta Pharma business combination completed in 2016 were: Fair value $m Non-current assets Intangible assets Note 9 7,307 Current assets 253 Current liabilities 90 Non-current liabilities Deferred tax liabilities 1,777 Total net assets acquired 5,693 Non-controlling interests 1,903 Goodwill Note 8 19 Fair value of total consideration 3,809 Less: fair value of deferred consideration 1,332 2,477 Total upfront consideration Less: cash and cash equivalents acquired 94 Net cash outflow 2,383 Acquisition costs were immaterial.
AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 173 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 25 Acquisitions of business operations continued 2015 Acquisitions ZS Pharma On 17 December 2015, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of ZS Pharma, a biopharmaceutical company based in San Mateo, California.
ZS Pharma uses its proprietary ion-trap technology to develop novel treatments for hyperkalaemia, a serious condition of elevated potassium in the bloodstream, typically associated with chronic kidney disease CKD and chronic heart failure CHF.
The acquisition gives AstraZeneca access to the potassium-binding compound ZS-9, a potential best-in-class treatment for hyperkalaemia.
ZS Pharma represents a strong fit with AstraZenecas pipeline and portfolio in Cardiovascular & Metabolic Diseases, one of the Companys three main therapy areas.
AstraZenecas strategy focuses on reducing morbidity, mortality and organ damage by addressing multiple risk factors across cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
ZS-9 complements the Companys increasing focus on CKD and CHF, including the investigational medicine roxadustat, which is currently in Phase III development for patients with anaemia associated with CKD, as well as its leading Diabetes portfolio.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca acquired 100% of the share capital of ZS Pharma for $90 per share in an all-cash transaction, or approximately $2.7bn in aggregate transaction value.
ZS Pharma has around 200 employees across three sites in California, Texas and Colorado.
The combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to research and development and manufacturing, requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Goodwill is principally attributable to the commercial synergies AstraZeneca expects to be able to realise upon launch of ZS-9, the value of the specialist know-how inherent in the acquired workforce and the accounting for deferred taxes.
ZS Pharmas results have been consolidated into the Groups results from 17 December 2015.
From the period from acquisition to 31 December 2015, ZS Pharmas revenues and loss were immaterial.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2015, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2015 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $2,702m.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2015 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.

174 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and swaps, currency options, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options or as part of a risk management strategy.
The Group is not a net seller of options, and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note 22, debt Note 17 and cash Note 16.
For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
The Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables.
These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IAS 39.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Boards distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend and, subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2012 decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic flexibility.
The Groups net debt position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, other investments and derivative financial instruments has increased from a net debt position of $10,657m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $12,679m at 31 December 2017, primarily as a result of cash outflows from investing activities, including acquisitions.
Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-2 by Moodys and A-2 by Standard and Poors.
The Groups long-term credit rating is A3 negative outlook by Moodys and BBB stable outlook by Standard and Poors.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $3,324m, fixed deposits of $80m, less overdrafts of $152m at 31 December 2017, the Group has committed bank facilities of $3bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31 December 2017, the Group has issued $3,959m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $12,980m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities of $3bn mature in April 2022 and were undrawn at 31 December 2017.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Groups financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows: Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative Crossderivative and other Finance and other financial Interest currency financial loans Bonds leases payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 851 568 66 11,701 13,186 54 17 71 13,115 In one to two years 2,318 41 1,522 3,881 54 17 71 3,810 In two to three years 1,865 22 1,110 2,997 19 26 45 2,952 In three to four years 1,444 10 1,277 2,731 15 330 345 2,386 In four to five years 2,025 2 2,187 4,214 15 15 4,199 In more than five years 14,192 5,313 19,505 44 44 19,461 851 22,412 141 23,110 46,514 201 390 591 45,923 Effect of interest 2 8,194 46 8,242 201 67 268 7,974 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 109 3,990 4,099 126 3 123 4,222 31 December 2015 849 14,109 95 19,120 34,173 126 320 446 33,727 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 175 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative Crossderivative and other Finance and other financial Interest currency financial loans Bonds leases payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 455 2,374 42 10,566 13,437 54 32 22 13,415 In one to two years 1,921 24 4,986 6,931 19 12 7 6,924 In two to three years 1,500 16 1,144 2,660 15 216 231 2,429 In three to four years 2,080 10 1,666 3,756 15 47 32 3,788 In four to five years 7 1,756 3 877 2,643 15 86 71 2,714 In more than five years 14,796 3,624 18,420 30 320 290 18,710 462 24,427 95 22,863 47,847 148 281 133 47,980 Effect of interest 4 8,111 2 8,117 148 351 203 8,320 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 59 2,889 2,948 82 93 175 3,123 31 December 2016 458 16,257 93 19,974 36,782 82 163 245 36,537 Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative Crossderivative and other Finance and other financial Interest currency financial loans Bonds leases payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 859 1,985 5 11,840 14,689 10 420 410 15,099 In one to two years 1,564 1,976 3,540 12 100 112 3,428 In two to three years 2,144 1,586 3,730 12 295 283 4,013 In three to four years 16 2,000 3,240 5,256 12 747 759 4,497 In four to five years 1,736 1,112 2,848 12 34 22 2,870 In more than five years 15,575 2,808 18,383 12 26 14 18,397 875 25,004 5 22,562 48,446 70 72 142 48,304 Effect of interest 14 7,969 7,983 70 480 410 8,393 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 94 3,081 3,175 50 93 43 3,132 31 December 2017 861 16,941 5 19,481 37,288 50 459 509 36,779 Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each year ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts, with the exception of $5,534m of contingent consideration and $1,823m arising from the put option over the non-controlling interest in Acerta Pharma, both held within other payables see Note 18.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt is held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
During the year the Group issued $2.0bn of bonds maturing in 2022 and 2027 to refinance the $1.75bn 5.9% 2017 bond and for general corporate purposes.
At 31 December 2017, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $0.9bn, converting the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 1.75% callable bond maturing in 2018 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2017.
At 31 December 2017, swaps with a notional value of $0.6bn were designated in fair value hedge relationships and swaps with a notional value of $0.29bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 139.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds, fully collateralised repurchase arrangements and investment grade fixed securities.
176 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, is set out below.
In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Current financial liabilities with short maturities are classified as floating rate given the amounts borrowed are regularly reset to market rates.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 70% of Group external sales in 2017 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
As at 31 December 2017, 2.8% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 20.6% were denominated in euros.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The Group holds cross-currency swaps to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Fair value movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective, with any ineffectiveness taken to profit.
In 2017, following a reduction in the value of the Group's euro net assets, 300m of our 750m 0.875% 2021 bond was fide-designated from the Group's euro net investment hedge relationship.
Subsequently a 300m cross-currency swap was transacted and designated as a fair value hedge of the resulting exposure to movements in the euro:US dollar exchange rate.
Foreign currency risk arises when the Group has inter-company funding and investments in certain subsidiaries operating in countries with exchange controls.
In Venezuela, the official exchange rate for essential goods and services is VEF 10 $ the DIPRO rate as published by CENCOEX the National Foreign Trade Center.
Alternative exchange rates include the DICOM rate, which is a second official exchange tier to cover non essentials.
At 31 December 2017, the DICOM rate was approximately VEF 3,300 $.
During 2017, the Group began using the DICOM rate for the consolidation of the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiaries.
The Group believes that this rate represents the most appropriate rate for consolidation as it reflects their best expectation of the rate at which profits will be remitted.
The remaining foreign exchange risk to the Group in respect of Venezuela is now immaterial.
Transactional One hundred percent of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out overleaf summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 177 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2017, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2017, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $28m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2017, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and Cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, Trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its Net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Under IFRS 9, the Group records the effect of the losses and gains, arising from own credit risk, on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss in Other comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific Trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 60% of US sales 2016: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 83%: 2015: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 84%.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2017 2016 2015 $m $m $m Not past due 2,488 2,559 4,388 Past due 090 days 260 14 189 Past due 90180 days 31 21 Past due 180 days 23 10 35 2,802 2,583 4,633 2017 2016 2015 $m $m $m Movements in provisions for trade receivables At 1 January 52 54 42 Income statement 26 2 Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements 10 4 At 31 December 16 42 52 The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers.
Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
The income statement credit or charge is recorded in Selling, general and administrative costs.
178 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Group's cash is invested in US dollar AAArated liquidity funds, fully collateralised repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2017 was $1,149m invested in five AAA-rated liquidity funds.
The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating.
The group does not invest in more than 10% of the total third party managed fund portfolio for each individual fund.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had investments of $1,150m 2016: $950m: 2015: $1,050m in short-term repurchase agreements, which are fully collateralised investments.
In the event of any default, ownership of the collateral would revert to the Group and would be readily convertible to cash.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2017 was $513m 2016: $322m: 2015: $451m and the carrying value of each cash collateral posted by the Group at 31 December 2017 was $nil 2016: $80m: 2015: $nil.

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Groups employee incentive schemes provide competitive and marketrelated packages to motivate employees.
They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through longterm share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.

The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years.
The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET.
Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
Sweden In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash.
There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 129 participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share trust.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.
Share plans The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $220m 2016: $241m: 2015: $211m.
The plans are equity settled.
The AstraZeneca UK All-Employee Share Plan The Company offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares Ordinary Shares.
Employees may invest up to 1,800 over a 12- month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period.
The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12-month period.
In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element, the first award of which was made in 2011.
Currently one Matching Share is awarded for every four Partnership Shares purchased.
Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs HMRCapproved All-Employee Share Plan.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca 2014 Performance Share Plan PSP This plan was approved by shareholders in 2014 for a period of 10 years and replaces the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan.
Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a closed period of the Company.
The first grant of awards was made in May 2014.
Awards granted under the plan vest after three years, or in the case of Executive Directors and members of the SET, after an additional two-year holding period, and can be subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
For awards granted to all participants in 2017, vesting is subject to a combination of measures focused on scientific leadership, revenue growth and financial performance.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate.
The main grant of awards in 2017 under the plan took place in March with further grants in May and August.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations, including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

Revenuerelated milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales eg royalty-type payments which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised.
The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Risk section from page 210, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities The Groups expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs that are necessary for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
This includes investment to conserve natural resources and otherwise minimise the impact of our activities on the environment.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Groups research, manufacturing and commercial operations and are not separated from overall operating and development costs.
There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2015, 2016 or 2017.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination.
In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc. and or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties PRPs or defendants at approximately 13 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes together, US Environmental Consequences.
Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC SMC, which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company acquired that year, and or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at 35 sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences.
AstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US.
These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Groups business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Groups R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably.
With respect to such estimated future costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2017 in the aggregate of $59m 2016: $59m: 2015: $67m, mainly relating to the US.
Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation.
Where the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain.
It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions.
The extent of such possible additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to a number of factors, including: 1 the nature and extent of claims that may be asserted in the future: 2 whether AstraZeneca has or will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted claims: 3 the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected at sites where the remedy is presently not known: 4 the potential for recoveries from or allocation of liability to third parties: and 5 the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation and liability allocation process can take.
Notwithstanding and subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential additional loss for future environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions to be, in aggregate, between $87m and $144m 2016: $85m and $141m: 2015: $71m and $119m, which relates mainly to the US.
182 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2017 Financial Statements Financial Statements 28 Commitments and contingent liabilities continued Legal proceedings AstraZeneca is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including actual or threatened litigation and or actual or potential government investigations relating to employment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and marketing practices, infringement of IP rights, and the validity of certain patents and competition laws.
The more significant matters are discussed below.
Most of the claims involve highly complex issues.
Often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is difficult to ascertain.
Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings.
In these cases, AstraZeneca discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the cases.
With respect to each of the legal proceedings described below, other than those for which provision has been made, we are unable to make estimates of the possible loss or range of possible losses at this stage, other than as set forth in this section.
We also do not believe that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if known, would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.
This is due to a number of factors, including: 1 the stage of the proceedings in many cases trial dates have not been set and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery: 2 the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision: 3 clarity as to theories of liability, damages and governing law: 4 uncertainties in timing of litigation: and 5 the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any.
While there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings referred to in this Note 28, based on managements current and considered view of each situation, we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
This position could of course change over time, not least because of the factors referred to above.
In cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines and penalties have been assessed and which are not subject to appeal or other similar forms of relief, or where a loss is probable and we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the loss, we generally indicate the loss absorbed or make a provision for our best estimate of the expected loss.
Where it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, legal costs involved in defending the claim are charged to profit as they are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which provides the right to reimbursement from insurance or otherwise of legal costs and or all or part of any loss incurred or for which a provision has been established, and we consider recovery to be virtually certain, the best estimate of the amount expected to be received is recognised as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to recognise provisions or assets, and of the amounts concerned, usually involve a series of complex judgements about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
AstraZeneca believes that the provisions recorded are adequate based on currently available information and that the insurance recoveries recorded will be received.
However, given the inherent uncertainties involved in assessing the outcomes of these cases, and in estimating the amount of the potential losses and the associated insurance recoveries, we could in the future incur judgments or insurance settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results in any particular period.
IP claims include challenges to the Groups patents on various products or processes and assertions of non-infringement of patents.
A loss in any of these cases could result in loss of patent protection on the related product.
The consequences of any such loss could be a significant decrease in product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.
The lawsuits filed by AstraZeneca for patent infringement against companies that have filed ANDAs in the US, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by the Group prior to the expiry of the applicable patents covering these products, typically also involve allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of these patents by the ANDA filers.
In the event that the Group is unsuccessful in these actions or the statutory 30-month stay expires before a ruling is obtained, the ANDA filers involved will also have the ability, subject to FDA approval, to introduce generic versions of the product concerned.
AstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will vigorously defend and enforce, its IP.
Over the course of the past several years, including in 2017, a significant number of commercial litigation claims in which AstraZeneca is involved have been resolved, particularly in the US, thereby reducing potential contingent liability exposure arising from such litigation.
Similarly, in part due to patent litigation and settlement developments, greater certainty has been achieved regarding possible generic entry dates with respect to some of our patented products.
At the same time, like other companies in the pharmaceutical sector and other industries, AstraZeneca continues to be subject to government investigations around the world.
Patent litigation Brilinta ticagrelor US patent proceedings In 2015, in response to Paragraph IV notices from multiple ANDA filers, AstraZeneca filed patent infringement lawsuits in the US District Court for the District of Delaware the District Court relating to patents listed in the FDA Orange Book with reference to Brilinta.
AstraZeneca continues to litigate in the District Court against the ANDA filers.
Trials are scheduled for March and April 2018.
Patent proceedings outside the US In Canada, in June 2017, Teva Canada Limited challenged the patents listed on the Canadian Patent Register with reference to Brilinta.
In September 2017, Apotex Inc. did the same.
AstraZeneca has responded to the challenges and hearings are scheduled for April and May 2019.
In China, in October 2017, the Chinese Patent Office issued a decision invalidating one of AstraZeneca's Chinese substance patents relating to Brilinta.
The patent, Chinese Patent No.
ZL99815926.3, is due to expire in December 2019.
Byetta exenatide US patent proceedings In December 2015, AstraZeneca filed a patent infringement lawsuit in response to a Paragraph IV notice from Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC Amneal relating to patents listed in the FDA Orange Book with reference to Byetta.

In addition to the investigations described above, various law enforcement offices have, from time to time, requested information from the Group.
There have been no material developments in those matters.
Tax Where tax exposures can be quantified, an accrual is made based on best estimates and managements judgement.
Details of the movements in relation to material tax exposures are discussed below.
As accruals can be built up over a long period of time but the ultimate resolution of tax exposures usually occurs at a point in time, and given the inherent uncertainties in assessing the outcomes of these exposures which sometimes can be binary in nature, we could, in future periods, experience adjustments to these accruals that have a material positive or negative effect on our results in any particular period.
AstraZeneca faces a number of audits and reviews in jurisdictions around the world and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax authorities.
The issues under discussion are often complex and can require many years to resolve.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgements with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit, and actual results could vary from these estimates.
Transfer pricing and other international tax contingencies The total net accrual included in the Group Financial Statements to cover the worldwide exposure to transfer pricing audits is $235m, a decrease of $85m compared with 2016 mainly due to the revision to the presentation of interest on tax contingencies and a reduction in accruals for transfer pricing contingencies as a result of tax authority discussions and audit settlements.
Management continues to believe that AstraZenecas positions on all its transfer pricing audits and disputes are robust, and that AstraZeneca is appropriately provided, including the assessment where corresponding relief will be available.
For transfer pricing audits where AstraZeneca and the tax authorities are in dispute, AstraZeneca estimates the potential for reasonably possible additional losses above and beyond the amount provided to be up to $30m 2016: $184m: 2015: $357m.
However, management believes that it is unlikely that these additional losses will arise.
It is possible that some of these contingencies may reduce in the future to the extent that any tax authority challenge is unsuccessful, or matters lapse following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in future periods.
Other tax contingencies Included in the tax accrual is $932m relating to a number of other tax contingencies, a decrease of $76m mainly due to the revision to the presentation of interest on tax contingencies and releases following expiry of statute of limitations, partially offset by the impact of an additional year of transactions relating to contingencies for which accruals had already been established and exchange rate effects.
For these tax exposures, AstraZeneca does not expect material additional losses.
It is, however, possible that some of these contingencies may reduce in the future if any tax authority challenge is unsuccessful or matters lapse following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in future periods.
Timing of cash flows and interest It is not possible to estimate the timing of tax cash flows in relation to each outcome.
However, it is anticipated that a number of significant disputes may be resolved over the next one to two years.
Included within other receivables and payables is a net amount of interest arising on tax contingencies of $72m.
