Cushman & Wakefield Debenham Tie Leung Limited, Chartered Surveyors have valued the Groups properties, excluding those held by the Groups premium outlet investments which have been valued by Cushman & Wakefield LLP, Chartered Surveyors.
Valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014 based on certain assumptions as set out in note 1.
Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are independent of the portfolio value.
Summaries of the valuers reports are available on the Companys website: www.
In the case of leasehold properties, valuations are net of any obligation to freeholders or superior leaseholders.
To comply with IAS 40 and IAS 17 these obligations and the related leasehold assets are included in the balance sheet within Obligations under head leases note 21 and Interests in leasehold properties respectively.
Further information is provided in Significant accounting policies on page 138.
As noted in Significant judgements and key estimates on page 136, real estate valuations are complex, derived from data which is not widely publicly available and involve a degree of judgement.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
Inputs to the valuations, some of which are unobservable as defined by IFRS 13, include capitalisation yields nominal equivalent yield and market rental income ERV.
These inputs to the valuations are analysed by segment in the rental and valuation data tables on pages 178 and 181 and the valuation change analysis in the Property Portfolio Review on page 51.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst increases in capitalisation yields and discount rates would result in a fall in values and vice versa.
However, there are interrelationships between unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase of more than one unobservable input would augment the impact on valuation.
The impact on the valuation would be mitigated by the interrelationship between unobservable inputs moving in opposite directions.
For example, an increase in rents may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation.
A sensitivity analysis showing the impact on valuations of changes in yields and rental income is shown below.

Capitalised interest is calculated using the cost of secured debt or the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings, as appropriate, and the effective rate applied in 2017 was 2.9% 2016: 3.1%.
At 31 December 2017 the historic cost of investment and development properties was 3,912.8 million 2016: 3,852.6 million.
At 31 December 2017, investment properties included two properties with a total value of 92.5 million.
A sale contract was exchanged in January 2018 and completed on 9 February 2018 for one property, and exchanged in February 2018 for the other property, with completion expected in March 2018.
Joint operations At 31 December 2017, investment properties included properties with a value of 202.4 million 2016: 75.6 million held within joint operations which are jointly controlled and proportionally consolidated.
The Hammerson ICAV acquired a 50% interest in the Ilac Centre, Dublin in December 2016 and a Co-Ownership agreement is in place with Irish Life Assurance plc, the holders of the remaining 50% interest.
The Hammerson ICAV also holds a 50% interest in Pavilions Swords, Dublin, acquired in September 2017 and a Co-Ownership agreement is in place with Irish Life Assurance plc and IPUT plc, both of which hold a 25% interest in the property.

COM 159 158 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 HAMMERSON.
COM 159 Notes to the financial statements continued 20: Financial instruments and risk management A: Financing strategy The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which the Group maintains strong working relationships.
An analysis of the maturity of the undrawn element of these revolving credit facilities is shown in note 20D.
The Groups borrowing position at 31 December 2017 is summarised below: Receivables: Loans and other Loans and other 2017 2016 Non-current assets borrowings 1year borrowings 1year Total Total m m m m m 14 19 19 Notes Borrowings Bonds 2,166.1 2,166.1 2,362.8 Bank loans and overdrafts 496.6 496.6 800.0 Senior notes 689.7 689.7 330.8 Fair value of currency swaps 10.3 1.7 98.9 90.3 2.7 10.3 1.7 3,451.3 3,442.7 3,496.3 B: Interest rate and foreign currency management Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to floating rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to floating rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had interest rate swaps of 250.0 million 2016: 250.0 million, maturing in 2020 under which the Group pays interest at a rate linked to LIBOR and receives interest at 6.875%.
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of interest rate swaps was an asset of 6.3 million 2016: 19.3 million.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is excluded from the Groups borrowings as the fair value will crystallise over the life of the instruments rather than at maturity.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.

Similarly, a decrease of 5% would decrease the carrying amount by 7.5 million.
The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities equate to their book values.
