G. DT, and Orange Telecommunications Group Ltd Orange, in exchange for the issue of 1,595m Consideration Shares and 3,464m cash.
The value of the Consideration Shares and cash allotted to DT and Orange at Completion was 10,971m.
Subsequently on 29 January 2016 the company sold its entire investment in EE to its wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, at fair value in exchange for an intercompany loan.

The company held a 100% investment in BT Group Investments Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, throughout 2016 17 and 2015 16.
Merger reserve On 29 January 2016, the company issued 1,594,900,429 ordinary shares of 5p at 470.7p per share resulting in a total of 80m being credited to Share capital.
These shares were used as part consideration for the acquisition of EE, which completed on 29 January 2016 note 2 above and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
As a result of this transaction, a merger reserve was created of 7,424m, net of 3m issue costs.
The acquisition of EE was structured by way of a share-for-share exchange and cash.
This transaction fell within the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 merger relief such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the shares issued.
The company chose to record its investment in EE at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable ie equal to the difference between the fair value of EE and the aggregate nominal value of the shares issued.
This merger reserve was initially considered unrealised on the basis that it was represented by the investment in EE which is not considered to be qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 10 Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006.
Immediately following the acquisition of EE, the company transferred its investment in EE to its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc in exchange for an intercompany loan.
To the extent the loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realised.
Hence the merger reserve is an unrealised profit until it is realised by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
During 2016 17 1,775m 2015 16: nil of merger reserve was transferred to realised profit following the settlement of an intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
