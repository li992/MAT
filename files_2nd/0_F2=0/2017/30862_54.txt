This is often referred to as Debt at Par Value.
The current replacement or market value of the debt, which assumes it is repaid and renegotiated under current market conditions, is often referred to as the Debt at Fair Value.
This fair value is explained in note 22 d on page 67 of the financial statements.
The difference between fair and par values of the debt is subtracted from the NAV to derive the NAV with debt at fair value.
The fair value of the 50.0 million Debenture issued by the Company has been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using the yield from similar dated gilt plus a margin based on the five year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.

The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not track this index and consequently, there may be some divergence between the Companys performance and that of the benchmark.
Gearing Net Cash APM Gearing represents the excess amount above shareholders funds of total investments, expressed as a percentage of the shareholders funds.
If the amount calculated is negative, this is shown as a net cash position.

The discount is shown as a percentage of the NAV per share see page 4.
The opposite of a discount is a premium.
It is more common for an investment trusts shares to trade at a discount than at a premium.
Portfolio Turnover Portfolio turnover is based on the average equity purchases and sales expressed as a percentage of average opening and closing portfolio values excluding liquidity funds.
Performance Attribution Analysis of how the Company achieved its recorded performance relative to its benchmark.
Performance Attribution Definitions: Allocation Effect Measures the effect of allocating assets to sectors or asset types differently to the weighting in the benchmark.
Selection Effect Measures the effect of investing in securities to a greater or lesser extent than their weighting in the benchmark, or of investing in securities which are excluded from the benchmark.
Gearing Net Cash Measures the impact of borrowings or cash balances on the Companys performance relative to its benchmark.
Currency Hedge Measures the effect on the Companys performance of a gain or loss arising from the Companys hedging activities.
Management Fee Expenses The payment of fees and expenses reduces the level of total assets and therefore has a negative effect on the Companys relative performance.
Shares Issuance The issue of shares at a price in excess of the net asset value per share, has a positive effect on the Companys relative performance.
