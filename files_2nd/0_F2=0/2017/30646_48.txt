Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 143 15 Goodwill continued The key assumptions used for each group of cash generating units are disclosed below: KEY ASSUMPTIONS 2017 2016 Nominal Nominal Pre-tax long-term long-term discount market Pre-tax market rate growth rate discount rate growth rate scientific, Technical & Medical 10.1% 3% 10.0% 3% Risk & Business Analytics 12.3% 3% 11.7% 3% Legal 12.7% 2% 12.4% 2% Exhibitions 12.6% 3% 12.6% 3% The pre-tax discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reect a risk premium specic to each business.
Nominal long-term market growth rates, which are applied after the forecast period of up to five years, do not exceed the long-term average growth prospects for the sectors and territories in which the businesses operate.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management: an increase in the discount rate of 0.5%, a decrease in the compound annual growth rate for cash ow in the five-year forecast period of 2.0%, and a decrease in the nominal long-term market growth rates of 0.5%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment charges would result from these scenarios.
16 Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the statement of financial position at their fair value as atthe date of acquisition, less accumulated amortisation.
Internally generated intangible assets are stated in the statement of financial position at the directly attributable cost of creation of the asset, less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations comprise: market-related assets e. g. trademarks, imprints, brands : customer-related assets e. g. subscription bases, customer lists, customer relationships : editorial content: software and systems e. g. application infrastructure, product delivery platforms, in-process research and development : contract-based assets e. g. publishing rights, exhibition rights, supply contracts : and other intangible assets.
Internally generated intangible assets typically comprise software and systems development where an identiable asset is created that is probable to generate future economic benets.
Intangible assets, other than journal titles determined to have indefinite lives, are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets with nite lives are as follows: market and customer-related assets 3 to 40 years: content, software and other acquired intangible assets 3 to 20 years: and internally developed intangible assets 3 to 10 years.
Journal titles determined to have indefinite lives are not amortised and are subject to impairment review atleast annually, including a review of events and circumstances to ensure that they continue to support an indefinite useful life.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty On acquisition of a subsidiary or business, the purchase consideration is allocated between the net tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill on a fair value basis, with any excess purchase consideration representing goodwill.
The valuation of acquired intangible assets represents the estimated economic value in use, using standard valuation methodologies, including as appropriate, discounted cash ow, relief from royalty and comparable market transactions.
Acquired intangible assets are capitalised and amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, subject to impairment review.
The assumptions used are subject to management judgement.
Appropriate amortisation periods are selected based on assessments of the longevity of the brands and imprints, the strength and stability of customer relationships, the market positions of the acquired assets and the technological and competitive risks that they face.
Certain intangible assets in relation to acquired science and medical publishing businesses have been determined to have indefinite lives.
The longevity of these assets is evidenced by their long-established and well-regarded journal titles, and their characteristically stable market positions.
Development spend embraces investment in new products and other initiatives, ranging from the building of online delivery platforms, to launch costs of new services, to building new infrastructure and applications.
Launch costs and other ongoing operating expenses of new products and services are expensed as incurred.
The costs of building product applications, platforms and infrastructure are capitalised as intangible assets, where the investment they represent has demonstrable value and the technical and commercial feasibility is assured.
Costs eligible for capitalisation must be incremental, clearly identied and directly attributable to a particular project.
The resulting assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment reviews are carried out at least annually where indicators of impairment are identied.
Judgement is required in the assessment of the potential value of a development project, the identication of costs eligible for capitalisation and the selection of appropriate asset lives.
