co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 155 Supplementary information continued All-employee share plans It is important that all employees are offered the opportunity to own shares in Prudential, connecting them both to the success of the Company and to the interests of other shareholders.
Executive Directors are invited to participate in these plans on the same basis as other staff in their location.
Save As You Earn SAYE schemes UKbased Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved Prudential SavingsRelated Share Option Scheme.
This scheme allows all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.
Since 2014 participants have been able to elect to enter into savings contracts of up to 500 per month for a period of three or five years.
At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares.
If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest if applicable under the rules.
Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised.
No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Companys ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.
Details of Executive Directors rights under the SAYE scheme are set out in the Outstanding share options table.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UKbased Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Since April 2014, all UKbased employees have been able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of 150 per month from their gross salary partnership shares through the SIP.
For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential on the open market.
Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan.
If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.
The table below provides information about shares purchased under the SIP together with matching shares awarded on a 1:4 basis and dividend shares.

This is principally because the corporate taxes of the Group include those on the income of consolidated withprofits and unitlinked funds that, through adjustments to benefits, are borne by policyholders.
These amounts are required to be included in the tax charge of the Company under IAS 12.
Consequently, the profit before all taxes measure is not representative of pretax profits attributable to shareholders.
Profit before all taxes is determined after deducting the cost of policyholder benefits and movements in the liability for unallocated surplus of the PAC withprofits fund after adjusting for taxes borne by policyholders.

The Group has operations in Asia, the US, UK and Europe and Africa.
Prudential offers a wide range of retail financial products and services and asset management services throughout these territories.
The retail financial products and services primarily include life insurance, pensions and annuities as well as collective investment schemes.
Basis of preparation These statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and as endorsed by the European Union EU as required by EU law IAS Regulation EC1606 2032.
EUendorsed IFRS Standards may differ from IFRS Standards issued by the IASB if, at any point in time, new or amended IFRS Standards have not been endorsed by the EU.
At 31 December 2017, there were no unendorsed standards effective for the two years ended 31 December 2017 which impact the consolidated financial information of the Group.
There were no differences between IFRS Standards endorsed by the EU and IFRS Standards issued by the IASB in terms of their application to the Group.
These statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The parent company statement of financial position prepared in accordance with the UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework is presented on page 305.
The Group IFRS accounting policies are the same as those applied for the year ended 31 December 2016 with the exception of the adoption of the new and amended accounting standards as described in note A2.
Exchange rates The exchange rates applied for balances and transactions in currency other than the presentational currency of the Group, pounds sterling GBP were: Closing Average rate Closing Average rate rate at for rate at for 31 Dec 2017 2017 31 Dec 2016 2016 Local currency: Hong Kong 10.57 10.04 9.58 10.52 Indonesia 18,353.44 17,249.38 16,647.30 18,026.11 Malaysia 5.47 5.54 5.54 5.61 Singapore 1.81 1.78 1.79 1.87 China 8.81 8.71 8.59 8.99 India 86.34 83.90 83.86 91.02 Vietnam 30,719.60 29,279.71 28,136.99 30,292.79 Thailand 44.09 43.71 44.25 47.80 US 1.35 1.29 1.24 1.35 Certain notes to the financial statements present 2016 comparative information at Constant Exchange Rates CER, in addition to the reporting at Actual Exchange Rates AER used throughout the consolidated financial statements.
AER are actual historical exchange rates for the specific accounting period, being the average rates over the period for the income statement and the closing rates for the balance sheet at the balance sheet date.
CER results are calculated by translating prior period results using the current period foreign exchange rate ie current period average rates for the income statement and current period closing rates for the balance sheet.
The exchange movement arising during 2017 recognised in other comprehensive income is: 2017 m 2016 m Asia operations 295 785 US operations 477 853 Unallocated to a segment other funds 307 490 465 1,148 2017 included the recycling of the cumulative exchange gain of the sold Korea life business of 61 million to the income statement.
The exchange rate movement unallocated to a segment mainly reflects the translation of currency borrowings, issued by group holding companies, that have been designated as a net investment hedge against the currency risk of the Groups investment in Jackson.
A2 New accounting pronouncements in 2017 The IASB has issued the following new accounting pronouncements to be effective for 1 January 2017: Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows : Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes : and Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014 2016 cycle.

Other significant accounting policies are presented in note E1.
All accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented and normally are not subject to changes unless new accounting standards, interpretations or amendments are introduced by the IASB.
The preparation of these financial statements requires Prudential to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Prudential evaluates its estimates, including those related to longterm business provisioning and the fair value of assets.
Below are set out those critical accounting policies the application of which requires the Group to make critical estimates and judgements.

withprofits is a critical accounting policy.
A modified statutory basis of reporting was adopted by the Group on first time adoption of The measurement basis of policyholder IFRS in 2005.
This was set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by liabilities is dependent upon the Association of British Insurers ABI SORP.
An exception was for UK regulated with classification of the contracts under IFRS 4 profits funds which were measured under FRS 27 as discussed below.
FRS 27 and the ABI SORP were withdrawn in the UK for the accounting periods beginning Impacts 436 billion of liabilities.
As used in these consolidated financial statements, the terms FRS 27 and the ABI SORP refer to the requirements of these pronouncements prior to their withdrawal.
For investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participating features, IAS 39 is applied and, where the contract includes an investment management element, IAS 18, Revenue, applies.
The policies applied in each business unit are noted below.
When measuring policyholder contract liabilities a number of assumptions are applied to estimate future amounts due to or from the policyholder.
The nature of assumption varies by product and among the most significant are assumed rates of policyholders mortality, particularly in respect of annuities sold in the UK, and policyholder behaviour, particularly in the US.
Additional details of valuation methodologies and assumptions applied for material product types are discussed in note C4.2.
Measurement of insurance contract liabilities and investment contracts liabilities with discretionary participation features.
Asia insurance operations The policyholder liabilities for businesses in Asia are generally determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with the modified statutory basis.
Refinements to the local reserving methodology are generally treated as changes in estimates, dependent on their nature.
In some operations, Taiwan and India, US GAAP principles are applied.
While the basis of valuation of liabilities in this business is in accordance with the requirements of the ABI SORP, it may differ from that determined on the modified statutory basis for UK and Europe insurance operations with the same features.
US insurance operations The policyholder liabilities for Jacksons conventional protectiontype policies are determined under US GAAP principles with locked in assumptions for mortality, interest, policy lapses and expenses along with provisions for adverse deviations.
For other policies, the policyholder liabilities include the policyholder account balance.
For those investment contracts in the US with fixed and guaranteed terms, the Group uses the amortised cost model to measure the liability.
The US has no investment contracts with discretionary participation features.
The sensitivity of US insurance operations to variations in key estimates and assumptions, including policyholder behaviour, is discussed in note C7.3.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 169 A Background and critical accounting policies continued A3 Accounting policies continued A3.1 Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements continued Measurement of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus of with-profits continued UK and Europe insurance operations The UK regulated withprofits funds liabilities are the realistic basis liabilities in accordance with FRS 27.
The realistic basis requires the value of liabilities to be calculated as: A withprofits benefits reserve: plus Future policyrelated liabilities: plus The realistic current liabilities of the fund.
The withprofits benefits reserve is primarily based on the retrospective calculation of accumulated asset shares but is adjusted to reflect future policyholder benefits and other charges and expenses.
Asset shares broadly reflect the policyholders share of the withprofits fund assets attributable to their policies.
The future policyrelated liabilities must include a market consistent valuation of costs of guarantees, options and smoothing, less any related charges, and this amount is determined using either a stochastic approach, hedging costs or a series of deterministic projections with attributed probabilities.
The shareholders share of future costs of bonuses is included within the liabilities for unallocated surplus.
Shareholders share of profit is recognised in line with the distribution of bonuses to policyholders.
For the purposes of local regulations, segregated accounts are established for linked business for which policyholder benefits are wholly or partly determined by reference to specific investments or to an investmentrelated index.
The interest rates used in establishing policyholder benefit provisions for pension annuities in the course of payment are adjusted each year.
Mortality rates used in establishing policyholder benefits are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect actual experience.
The sensitivity of UK and Europe insurance operations to variations in key estimates and assumptions, including annuitant mortality, is discussed in note C7.4.
Measurement of investment contracts Investment contracts without discretionary participation features are measured in without discretionary participation features accordance with IAS 39 to reflect the deposit nature of the arrangement, with premiums liabilities.
and claims reflected as deposits and withdrawals and taken directly to the statement of financial position as movements in the financial liability balance.
Incremental, directly attributable acquisition costs relating to the investment management element of these contracts are capitalised and amortised in line with the related revenue.
If the contracts involve upfront charges, this income is also deferred and amortised through the income statement in line with contractual service provision in accordance with IAS 18.
Investment contracts without fixed and guaranteed terms are classified as financial instruments and designated as fair value through profit or loss because the resulting liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Where the contract includes a surrender option its carrying value is subject to a minimum carrying value equal to its surrender value.

The annual excess shortfall of income over expenditure of the withprofits funds, after declaration and attribution of the cost of bonuses to policyholders and shareholders, is transferred to from the unallocated surplus each year through a charge credit to the income statement.
The balance retained in the unallocated surplus represents cumulative income arising on the withprofits business that has not been allocated to policyholders or shareholders.
The balance of the unallocated surplus is determined after full provision for deferred tax on unrealised appreciation on investments.

Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement.
Jacksons liabilities for insurance contracts, which include those for separate accounts reflecting separate account assets, policyholder account values and guarantees measured as described in note C4.2 and the associated deferred acquisition cost asset are measured under US GAAP and liability adequacy testing is performed in this context.
Under US GAAP, most of Jacksons products are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 944, Financial Services Insurance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 944 whereby deferred acquisition costs are amortised in line with expected gross profits.
Recoverability of the deferred acquisition costs in the balance sheet is tested against the projected value of future profits using current estimates and therefore no additional liability adequacy test is required by IFRS 4.
The DAC recoverability test is performed in line with US GAAP requirements which in practice is at a grouped level of those contracts managed together.

investment return arises from such derivatives and debt securities.
The Group has decided that, except for occasional circumstances, applying hedge accounting using IAS 39 to derivative instruments held by Jackson would not improve the relevance or reliability of the financial statements to such an extent that would justify the difficulty and cost of applying these provisions.
As a result of this decision, the total income statement results are more volatile as the movements in the fair value of Jacksons derivatives are reflected within it.
This volatility is reflected in the level of shortterm fluctuations in investment returns, as shown in notes B1.1 and B1.2.
Under IAS 39, unless carried at amortised cost subject to impairment provisions where appropriate under the heldtomaturity category, debt securities are also carried at fair value.
The Group has chosen not to classify any financial assets as heldtomaturity.
Debt securities of Jackson are designated as availableforsale with value movements, unless impaired, being recorded as movements within other comprehensive income.

Shortterm fluctuations in fair value affect the result for the year and the Group provides additional analysis of results before and after the effects of shortterm fluctuations in investment returns, together with other items that are of a shortterm, volatile or oneoff nature.
The effects of shortterm fluctuations include asymmetric impacts where the measurement bases of the liabilities and associated derivatives used to manage the Jackson annuity business differ as described in note B1.2.
Shortterm fluctuations in investment returns on assets held by withprofits funds in the UK, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, do not affect directly reported shareholder results.
This is because i the unallocated surplus of withprofits funds is accounted for as a liability and ii excess or deficits of income and expenditure of the funds over the required surplus for distribution are transferred to or from policyholder liabilities including the unallocated surplus.
c Further critical estimates or judgements Deferred acquisition costs for insurance contracts The Group applies judgement in Except for acquisition costs of withprofits contracts of the UK regulated withprofits determining qualifying costs that should be funds, which are accounted for under FRS 27, costs of acquiring new insurance business capitalised ie those costs of acquiring new are accounted for in a way that is consistent with the principles of the ABI SORP with insurance business that meet the criteria deferral and amortisation against margins in future revenues on the related insurance under the Groups accounting policy for policies.
In general, this deferral is shown by an explicit carrying value in the balance deferred acquisition costs.
However, in some Asia operations the deferral is implicit through the reserving estimates in projecting future profits methodology.
The recoverability of the deferred acquisition costs is measured and is margins to assess whether adjustments to deemed impaired if the projected margins which are estimated based on a number of the carrying value or amortisation profile of assumptions similar to those underlying policyholder liabilities are less than the carrying deferred acquisition cost assets are value.

Asia insurance operations For those business units applying US GAAP to insurance assets and liabilities, as permitted by the ABI SORP, principles similar to those set out in the US insurance operations paragraph below are applied to the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs.
For other territories in Asia, the general principles of the ABI SORP are applied with, as described above, deferral of acquisition costs being either explicit or implicit through the reserving basis.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Deferred acquisition costs for insurance contracts continued US insurance operations The most material estimates and assumptions applied in the measurement and amortisation of deferred acquisition cost balances relate to the US insurance operations.
The Groups US insurance operations apply FAS ASU 201026 on Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts and capitalise only those incremental costs directly relating to successfully acquiring a contract.
For term business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected premiums.
For annuity and interestsensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
For fixed and fixed index annuity and interestsensitive life business, the key assumption is the longterm spread between the earned rate on investments and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges, all of which are based on a combination of Jacksons actual experience, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual mortality, lapse and expenses experience is performed using internally developed experience studies.
For US variable annuity business, a key assumption is the longterm investment return from the separate accounts, which is determined using a mean reversion methodology.
Under the mean reversion technique applied by Jackson, the projected level of return for each of the next five years is adjusted from period to period, so that in combination with the actual rates of return for the preceding three years, including the current period, the assumed longterm annual return gross of asset management fees and other charges to policyholders, but net of external fund management fees is realised on average over the entire eightyear period.
Projected returns after the mean reversion period revert back to the longterm investment return.
For further details on current balances, assumptions and sensitivity, refer to note C5 b and C7.3 iv.
To ensure that the methodology in extreme market movements produces future expected returns that are realistic, the mean reversion technique has a cap and floor feature whereby the projected returns in each of the next five years can be no more than 15 per cent per annum and no less than 0 per cent per annum both gross of asset management fees and other charges to policyholders, but net of external fund management fees in each year.
Jackson makes certain adjustments to the deferred acquisition costs which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income shadow accounting.
If the recognition of unrealised gains or losses on availableforsale securities causes adjustments to the carrying value and amortisation patterns of deferred acquisition costs and deferred income, these adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income consistent with the gains or losses on the securities.
More precisely, shadow deferred acquisition costs adjustments reflect the change in deferred acquisition costs that would have arisen if the assets held in the statement of financial position had been sold, crystallising unrealised gains or losses, and the proceeds reinvested at the yields currently available in the market.
UK and Europe insurance operations For UK regulated withprofits funds where grandfathered FRS 27 is applied, these costs are expensed as incurred.
The majority of the UK shareholderbacked business is individual and group annuity business where the deferral of acquisition costs is negligible.

The Group establishes fair value for these financial investments by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers or pricing services, or by using internally developed pricing models.
Priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing and or the valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The valuation techniques include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, optionadjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation and may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these financial investments.
Details of the financial investments classified as level 3 to which valuation techniques are applied, and the sensitivity of profit before tax to a change in these items valuation, are presented in note C3.1 d. Determination of impaired value In estimating the present value of future cash flows for determining the impaired value of instruments held at amortised cost, the Group looks at the expected cash flows of the assets and applies historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks that has been adjusted for conditions in the historical loss experience which no longer exist, or for conditions that are expected to arise.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted using the financial assets original or variable effective interest rate and exclude credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
In estimating any required impairment for US residential mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities held as availableforsale, the expected value of future cash flows is determined using a model, the key assumptions of which include how much of the currently delinquent loans will eventually default and assumed loss severity.

These assessments are based on the best available information at the time.
Factors such as market liquidity, the widening of bid ask spreads and a change in cash flow assumptions can contribute to future price volatility.
If actual experience differs negatively from the assumptions and other considerations used in the consolidated financial statements, unrealised losses currently in equity may be recognised in the income statement in future periods.
Additional details on the methodology and estimates used to determine impairments of the availableforsale securities of Jackson are described in note C3.2 g. The majority of the US insurance operations debt securities portfolio is accounted for on an availableforsale basis.
The consideration of evidence of impairment requires managements judgement.
In making this determination a range of market and industry indicators are considered including the severity and duration of the decline in fair value and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer.
For US residential mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities, all of which are classified as availableforsale, impairment is estimated using a model of expected future cash flows.
Key assumptions used in the model include assumptions about how much of the currently delinquent loans will eventually default and assumed loss severity.
Assets held at amortised cost Assets held at amortised cost are subject to impairment testing where appropriate under IFRS requirements by comparing estimated future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset.
In estimating future cash flows, the Group looks at the expected cash flows of the assets and applies historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks that has been adjusted for conditions in the historical loss experience which no longer exist, or for conditions that are expected to arise.
Reversal of impairment losses If, in subsequent periods, an impaired debt security held on an availableforsale basis or an impaired loan or receivable recovers in value in part or in full, and this recovery can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement in part or in full.

If an impairment has occurred, an impairment charge is recognised for the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount of the asset.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated as the present value of future expected cash flows from the asset or the cash generating unit to which it is allocated.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 175 A Background and critical accounting policies continued A3 Accounting policies continued A3.2 New accounting pronouncements not yet effective The following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued but are not yet effective in 2017, including those which have not yet been adopted in the EU.
This is not intended to be a complete list as only those standards, interpretations and amendments that could have an impact upon the Groups financial statements are discussed.
Accounting pronouncements endorsed by the EU but not yet effective IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers This standard effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, provides a single framework to recognise revenue for contracts with different characteristics and overrides the framework provided for such contracts in other standards.
The contracts excluded from the scope of this standard include: Lease contracts within the scope of IAS 17 Leases: Insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: and Financial instruments within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments.
As a result, IFRS 15 in the context of Prudentials business, applies to the Groups asset management contracts and the measurement of the Groups investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participating features where the contracts include provision for investment management services.
The IFRS 15 impact assessment performed included the review of the recognition of asset management and performance fees of these contracts.
The adoption of this standard in 2018 is not expected to result in a restatement of the Groups profit for the year or shareholders equity.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments: Classification and measurement In July 2014, the IASB published a complete version of IFRS 9 with the exception of macro hedge accounting.
The standard becomes mandatorily effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted and transitional rules apply.
In October 2017, the IASB issued two amendments to IFRS 9, to permit the measurement of debt instruments with prepayment compensation features to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income if certain conditions are met, and to clarify that IFRS 9 applies to longterm interests in joint ventures and associates.
Both of these amendments that were issued in October 2017 are effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, but are not yet endorsed by the EU.
In September 2016, the IASB published Amendments to IFRS 4, Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts to address the temporary consequences of the different effective dates of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts.
The amendments include an optional temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 and the associated amendments until IFRS 17 comes into effect in 2021.
This temporary exemption is available to companies whose predominant activity is to issue insurance contracts based on meeting the eligibility criteria as at 31 December 2015 as set out in the amendments.
The Group met the eligibility criteria and will defer the adoption of IFRS 9 to 1 January 2021.
When adopted IFRS 9 replaces the existing IAS 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement, and will affect the following three areas: The classification and the measurement of financial assets and liabilities Under IFRS 9, the classification of financial assets is redefined.
Based on the business model in which the assets are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, financial assets are classified into one of the following categories: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI and fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
An option is also available at initial recognition to irrevocably designate a financial asset as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces accounting mismatches.
At present a significant proportion 82 per cent of the Groups investments are valued at FVTPL and the Groups current expectation is that a significant proportion will continue to be designated as such under IFRS 9.
The existing IAS 39 amortised cost measurement for financial liabilities is largely maintained under IFRS 9 but for financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, changes in fair value due to changes in entitys own credit risk, required by IFRS 13, are to be recognised in other comprehensive income.
The calculation of the impairment charge relevant for financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI A new impairment model based on an expected credit loss approach replaces the existing IAS 39 incurred loss impairment model, resulting in earlier recognition of credit losses compared to IAS 39.
The impairment charge recognition under the new model is in three stages: Stage 1 at initial recognition, and for each subsequent reporting period when there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, recognise 12 month expected credit losses: Stage 2 recognise lifetime expected credit losses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition: or Stage 3 recognise incurred losses for creditimpaired assets, similar to IAS 39.
This aspect is the most complex area of IFRS 9 to implement and will involve significant judgements and estimate processes.
The hedge accounting requirements which are more closely aligned with the risk management activities of the Company.
No significant change to the Groups hedge accounting is currently anticipated, but this remains under review.
176 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 9 and implementing this standard in conjunction with the IFRS 17.
Further details on IFRS 17 are provided below.
Adoption of IFRS 9 may result in reclassifying certain of the Groups financial assets and hence lead to a change in the measurement of those instruments or the reporting of their value.
In addition, for any investments classified as amortised cost or FVOCI, as noted above, the impairment provisioning approach is altered from the current IAS 39 approach.
The Group is currently assessing the scope of assets to which these requirements will apply.
The Group does not currently apply hedge accounting for most of its derivate programmes but will reconsider its approach in light of new requirements under the standard on adoption.
IFRS 16, Leases In January 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 Leases effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier adoption permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has also been applied.
The new standard brings most leases onbalance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases.
For lessee accounting, this has the effect of requiring most of the existing operating leases to be accounted for in a similar manner as finance leases under the existing IAS 17, Leases.
The only optional exemptions are for shortterm leases and leases of lowvalue assets.
Lessor accounting however remains largely unchanged from IAS 17.
IFRS 16 applies primarily to operating leases of major properties occupied by the Groups businesses where Prudential is a lessee.
Under IFRS 16, these leases will be brought onto the Groups statement of financial position with a right to use asset being established and a corresponding liability representing the obligation to make lease payments.
The current rental accrual charge in the income statement will be replaced with a depreciation charge for the right to use asset and an interest expense on the lease liability leading to a more frontloaded operating lease cost profile compared to IAS 17.
The Group is currently sourcing the required information to implement this new standard.
IFRS 16 permits transition to the new standard through a modified retrospective approach or a full retrospective approach.
Under the modified retrospective approach, as well as affording a number of simplifications the Groups comparative information is not restated, but there is an adjustment to retained earnings at the date of initial application ie 1 January 2019.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the modified retrospective approach before confirming the approach it intends to adopt.
The ultimate impact of IFRS 16 on the Groups financial statements will be dependent on the leases that are in place and the related discount rate on the date of initial application.
Accounting pronouncements not yet endorsed by the EU IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts to replace the existing IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.
The standard, which is subject to endorsement in the EU and other territories, applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.
Early application is permitted: provided the entity also applies IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on or before the date it first applies IFRS 17.
The Group intends to adopt the new standard on its mandatory effective date in 2021, alongside the adoption of IFRS 9 see above.
IFRS 4 permitted insurers to continue to use the statutory basis of accounting for insurance assets and liabilities that existed in their jurisdictions prior to January 2005.
IFRS 17 replaces this with a new liability and revenue measurement model for all insurance contracts.
The new measurement model requires liabilities for insurance contracts to be recognised as the present value of future cash flows, incorporating an explicit risk adjustment, and a contractual service margin CSM that is equal and opposite to any dayone gain arising.
Losses are recognised directly into the income statement.
The present value of future cash flows and the risk adjustment are updated at each reporting date in order to reflect current conditions.
The CSM is released to the income statement as profit over the coverage period of the insurance contract, reflecting the delivery of services to the policyholder.
Subsequent changes in noneconomic assumptions applied to the valuation of insurance liabilities are recognised as an adjustment to the CSM, prospectively affecting the amounts released to the statement of comprehensive income.
For the purpose of the measurement insurance contracts are grouped together with contracts of similar risk, profitability profile and issue year, with the measurement model applied at this group level.
IFRS 17 provides an adaptation of the measurement model designed to account for certain contracts with participating features, such as UK style withprofits contracts and unitlinked or similar contracts, in which the policyholder will be paid a substantial share of the fair value returns of a specified group of items and the return to the insurer effectively reflects a variable management fee.
This adaptation the Variable Fee Approach VFA allows the CSM to be adjusted for changes in economic experience and assumptions which reflect a change in the overall future fee the insurer expects to receive as a result of managing the participating pool of assets.
IFRS 17 introduces a new measure of insurance revenue, based on the delivery of services to policyholders and excluding any premiums related to the investment elements of policies, which will be significantly different from existing premium revenue measures, currently reported in the income statement.
Retrospective application of the standard is required for determining the CSM for the opening balance sheet.
However, if full retrospective application for a group of insurance contracts is impracticable, then the entity is required to choose either a modified retrospective approach or a fair value approach.
Choosing the appropriate approach and hence determining the opening balance sheet is one of the most critical activities in implementing the new standard, as the approach adopted will have a significant impact on the entitys results both on the initial impact on shareholders funds at IFRS 17 adoption and on the future profits to be earned on the inforce business at the date of transition.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 177 A Background and critical accounting policies continued A3 Accounting policies continued A3.2 New accounting pronouncements not yet effective continued IFRS 17 Implementation Programme The Group has commenced a Groupwide programme to implement IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 as discussed above.
The requirements of IFRS 17 are complex and will have the effect of introducing fundamental changes to the existing IFRS 4 insurance accounting and require the application of significant judgement and new estimation techniques.
As previously highlighted IFRS 9 could require reclassification of investments and the introduction of new and complex impairment models.
The effect of changes required to the Groups accounting policies as a result of implementing these standards are currently uncertain, but these changes can be expected to, among other things, alter the timing of IFRS profit recognition.
The implementation of this standard is also likely to involve significant enhancements to IT, actuarial and finance systems of the Group, and so will have an impact on the Groups expenses.
A Groupwide Steering Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer and with participation from groups and business units senior finance managers, provides oversight and strategic direction to the implementation programme.
A number of sub committees are also in place to provide governance over the technical interpretation and accounting policies selected, programme management and design and delivery of the project.
The key responsibilities of the programme include setting a framework for Groupwide accounting policies, determining additional data requirements, assessing the level of IT and finance system changes as well as establishing an appropriate work plan for determining the opening balance sheet.
The work is at an early stage.
Other new accounting pronouncements In addition to the above, the following new accounting pronouncements have also been issued and are not yet effective but the Group is not expecting them to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements: Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and measurement of sharebased payment transactions, issued in June 2016 and effective from 1 January 2018: IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration, issued in December 2016 and effective from 1 January 2018: Amendments to IAS 40, Transfers of Investment Property, issued in December 2016 and effective from 1 January 2018: IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Taxes, issued June 2017 and effective from 1 January 2019: Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20152017 cycle: and Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement, issued on 7 February 2018 and effective from 1 January 2019.

As the Group applies US GAAP for the measured value of the product guarantees this item also includes asymmetric impacts where the measurement bases of the liabilities and associated derivatives used to manage the Jackson annuity business differ as described in note B1.3 c below.
The net equity hedge result therefore includes significant accounting mismatches and other factors that detract from the presentation of an economic result.
These other factors include: T he variable annuity guarantees and fixed index annuity embedded options being only partially fair valued under grandfathered US GAAP as described in note B1.3 c : T he interest rate exposure being managed through the other than equityrelated derivative programme explained in note b below: and J acksons management of its economic exposures for a number of other factors that are treated differently in the accounting frameworks such as future fees and assumed volatility levels.
The net equity hedge result net of related DAC can be summarised as follows: 2017 m 2016 m 1 Fair value movements on equity hedge instruments 1,871 1,786 2 Accounting value movements on the variable and fixed index annuity guarantee liabilities 99 188 Fee assessments net of claim payments 480 387 Total 1,490 1,587 1 Held to manage equity exposures of the variable annuity guarantees and fixed index annuity options.
2 The accounting value movements on the variable and fixed index annuity guarantee liabilities reflect the impact of market movements and changes in economic and actuarial assumptions.
These actuarial assumptions changes include, amongst other items, a charge net of related DAC of 359 million for strengthening policyholder utilisation and persistency rates offset by a benefit net of related DAC of 382 million from modelling refinements in the period, principally enhancements to how Jacksons own credit risk is incorporated in the fair valuation of these longterm liabilities.

The freestanding, other than equityrelated derivatives, are held to manage interest rate exposures and durations within the general account and the variable annuity guarantees and fixed index annuity embedded options described in note a above.
Accounting mismatches arise because of differences between the measurement basis and presentation of the derivatives, which are fair valued with movements recorded in the income statement, and the exposures they are intended to manage.

co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 181 B Earnings performance continued B1 Analysis of performance by segment continued B1.3 Determining operating segments and performance measure of operating segments Operating segments The Groups operating segments for financial reporting are defined and presented in accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments on the basis of the management reporting structure and its financial management information.
Following the combination during the year of the Groups UK insurance business and M&G to form M&G Prudential, the Group has reassessed its operating segments.
Under the Groups management and reporting structure its chief operating decisionmaker is the Group Executive Committee GEC.
In the revised management structure, responsibility is delegated to the Chief Executive Officers of Prudential Corporation Asia, the North American Business Unit and M&G Prudential for the daytoday management of their business units within the framework set out in the Group Governance Manual.
Financial management information used by the GEC has been revised to align with these three business segments.
These operating segments derive revenue from both longterm insurance and asset management activities.
In the prior year, the operating segments of the Group were each of the insurance operations in Asia, US and UK, and the asset management operations of Asia, US, M&G and Prudential Capital.
Operations which do not form part of any business unit are reported as Unallocated to a segment.
These include Group Head Office and Asia Regional Head Office costs.
Following the formation of M&G Prudential certain minor operations which were previously reported as Unallocated to a segment are now included in the UK and Europe segment, reflecting the revised structure.
Prudential Capital and Africa operations do not form part of any operating segment under the revised structure, and their assets and liabilities and loss before tax are not material to the overall financial position of the Group.
Prudential Capital and Africa operations are therefore reported as Unallocated to a segment.
Comparative segmental information for prior periods has been presented on a basis consistent with the current year.
Performance measure The performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Company is IFRS operating profit attributable to shareholders based on longerterm investment returns, as described below.
This measurement basis distinguishes operating profit based on longterm investment returns from other constituents of the total profit as follows: Shortterm fluctuations in investment returns on shareholderbacked business.
This includes the impact of shortterm market effects on the carrying value of Jacksons guarantee liabilities and related derivatives as explained below.
Amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business.
This comprises principally the charge for the adjustments arising on the purchase of REALIC in 2012: and Profit loss attaching to businesses that have been sold in the year including, where relevant, the recycling of the cumulative translation gain or loss in respect of sold businesses.
Determination of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for investment and liability movements: a General principles i UK style with-profits business The operating profit based on longerterm returns reflects the statutory transfer gross of attributable tax.
Value movements in the underlying assets of the withprofits funds do not affect directly the determination of operating profit.
ii Unit-linked business The policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the underlying asset value movements.
Accordingly, the operating results based on longerterm investment returns reflect the current period value movements in both the unit liabilities and the backing assets.
iii US variable annuity and fixed index annuity business This business has guarantee liabilities which are measured on a combination of fair value and other US GAAP derived principles.
These liabilities are subject to an extensive derivative programme to manage equity and interest rate exposures.
The principles for determination of the operating profit and shortterm fluctuations are necessarily bespoke, as discussed in section c below.
iv Business where policyholder liabilities are sensitive to market conditions Under IFRS, the degree to which the carrying values of liabilities to policyholders are sensitive to current market conditions varies between territories depending upon the nature of the grandfathered measurement basis.
In general, in those instances where the liabilities are particularly sensitive to routine changes in market conditions, the accounting basis is such that the impact of market movements on the assets and liabilities is broadly equivalent in the income statement, and operating profit based on longerterm investments returns is not distorted.
In these circumstances, there is no need for the movement in the liability to be bifurcated between the elements that relate to longerterm market conditions and shortterm effects.
However, movements in liabilities for some types of business do require bifurcation to ensure that at the net level ie after allocated investment return and charge for policyholder benefits the operating result reflects longerterm market returns.
Examples of where such bifurcation is necessary are in Hong Kong and for UK shareholderbacked annuity business, as explained in sections b i and d i, respectively.
For other types of Asias nonparticipating business, expected longerterm investment returns are used to determine the movement in policyholder liabilities for determining operating results.
182 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults v Other shareholder-financed business The measurement of operating profit based on longerterm investment returns reflects the particular features of longterm insurance business where assets and liabilities are held for the long term and for which the accounting basis for insurance liabilities under current IFRS is not generally conducive to demonstrating trends in underlying performance of life businesses exclusive of the effects of short term fluctuations in market conditions.
In determining the profit on this basis, the following key elements are applied to the results of the Groups shareholderfinanced operations.
Except in the case of assets backing liabilities which are directly matched such as unitlinked business or closely correlated with value movements as discussed below operating profit based on longerterm investment returns for shareholderfinanced business is determined on the basis of expected longerterm investment returns.
Longerterm investment returns comprise actual income receivable for the period interest dividend income and for both debt and equitytype securities longerterm capital returns.
Debt securities and loans In principle, for debt securities and loans, the longerterm capital returns comprise two elements: Risk margin reserve based charge for the expected level of defaults for the period, which is determined by reference to the credit quality of the portfolio.
The difference between impairment losses in the reporting period and the risk margin reserve charge to the operating result is reflected in shortterm fluctuations in investment returns: and The amortisation of interestrelated realised gains and losses to operating results based on longerterm investment returns to the date when sold bonds would have otherwise matured.
At 31 December 2017, the level of unamortised interestrelated realised gains and losses related to previously sold bonds for the Group was a net gain of 855 million 2016: 969 million.
Equity-type securities For equitytype securities, the longerterm rates of return are estimates of the longterm trend investment returns for income and capital having regard to past performance, current trends and future expectations.
Equitytype securities held for shareholderfinanced operations other than the UK annuity business, unitlinked and US variable annuity separate accounts are principally relevant for the US and Asia insurance operations.
Different rates apply to different categories of equitytype securities.
Derivative value movements Generally, derivative value movements are excluded from operating results based on longerterm investment returns unless those derivative value movements broadly offset changes in the accounting value of other assets and liabilities included in operating profit.
The principal example of derivatives whose value movements are excluded from operating profit arises in Jackson, as discussed below in section c. b Asia insurance operations i Business where policyholder liabilities are sensitive to market conditions For certain Asia nonparticipating business, for example in Hong Kong, the economic features are more akin to asset management products with policyholder liabilities reflecting asset shares over the contract term.
For these products, the charge for policyholder benefits in the operating results should reflect the asset share feature rather than volatile movements that would otherwise be reflected if the local regulatory basis also applied for IFRS basis was used.
For certain other types of nonparticipating business, expected longerterm investment returns are used to determine the movement in policyholder liabilities for determining operating results.
ii Other Asia shareholder-financed business Debt securities For this business, the realised gains and losses are principally interest related.
Accordingly, all realised gains and losses to date for these operations are being amortised over the period to the date those securities would otherwise have matured, with no explicit risk margin reserve charge.
Equity-type securities For Asia insurance operations, investments in equity securities held for nonlinked shareholderbacked operations amounted to 1,759 million as at 31 December 2017 2016: 1,405 million.
The rates of return applied in 2017 ranged from 4.3 per cent to 17.2 per cent 2016: 3.2 per cent to 13.9 per cent with the rates applied varying by business unit.
These rates are broadly stable from period to period but may be different between countries reflecting, for example, differing expectations of inflation in each business unit.
The assumptions are for the returns expected to apply in equilibrium conditions.
The assumed rates of return do not reflect any cyclical variability in economic performance and are not set by reference to prevailing asset valuations.
The longerterm investment returns for the Asia insurance joint ventures accounted for using the equity method are determined on a similar basis as the other Asia insurance operations described above.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 183 B Earnings performance continued B1 Analysis of performance by segment continued B1.3 Determining operating segments and performance measure of operating segments continued c US insurance operations i Separate account business For such business the policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the asset value movements.
Accordingly, the operating results based on longerterm investment returns reflect the current period value movements in unit liabilities and the backing assets.
ii US variable and fixed index annuity business The following value movements for Jacksons variable and fixed index annuity business are excluded from operating profit based on longerterm investment returns.
See note B1.2 i : Fair value movements for equitybased derivatives: Fair value movements for embedded derivatives for the not for life portion of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit GMWB and fixed index annuity business, and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit GMIB reinsurance see below : Movements in the accounts carrying value of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit GMDB, GMIB and the for life portion of GMWB liabilities see below, for which, under the grandfathered US GAAP applied under IFRS for Jacksons insurance assets and liabilities, the measurement basis gives rise to a muted impact of current period market movements ie they are relatively insensitive to the effect of current period equity market and interest rate changes : A portion of the fee assessments as well as claim payments, in respect of guarantee liabilities: and Related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs for each of the above items.
Embedded derivatives for the not for life portion of GMWB and fixed index annuity business The not for life portion of GMWB embedded derivative liabilities is measured under the US GAAP basis applied for IFRS in a manner consistent with IAS 39 under which the projected future growth rate of the account balance is based on current swap rates rather than expected rates of return with only a portion of the expected future guarantee fees included.
Reserve value movements on these liabilities are sensitive to changes to levels of equity markets, implied volatility and interest rates.
Embedded derivatives for variable annuity guarantee minimum income benefit The GMIB liability, which is substantially fully reinsured, subject to a deductible and annual claim limits, is accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 94480 Financial Services Insurance Separate Accounts formerly SOP 031 under IFRS using grandfathered US GAAP.
This accounting basis substantially does not recognise the effects of market movements.
As the corresponding reinsurance asset is net settled, it is considered to be a derivative under IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and the asset is therefore recognised at fair value.
As the GMIB is economically reinsured, the mark to market element of the reinsurance asset is included as a component of shortterm fluctuations in investment returns.
iii Other derivative value movements The principal example of nonequity based derivatives for example, interest rate swaps and swaptions whose value movements are excluded from operating profit, arises in Jackson.
Nonequity based derivatives are primarily held by Jackson as part of a broadlybased hedging programme for features of Jacksons bond portfolio for which value movements are booked in the statement of other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, product liabilities for which US GAAP accounting as grandfathered under IFRS 4 does not fully reflect the economic features being hedged, and the interest rate exposure attaching to equitybased embedded derivatives.
184 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults iv Other US shareholder-financed business Debt securities Jackson is the shareholderbacked operation for which the distinction between impairment losses and interestrelated realised gains and losses is in practice relevant to a significant extent.
Jackson has used the ratings by Nationally Recognised Statistical Ratings Organisations NRSRO or ratings resulting from the regulatory ratings detail issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC developed by external third parties such as BlackRock Solutions to determine the average annual risk margin reserve to apply to debt securities held to back general account business.
Debt securities held to back separate account and reinsurance funds withheld are not subject to risk margin reserve charge.
Further details of the risk margin reserve charge, as well as the amortisation of interestrelated realised gains and losses for Jackson are shown in note B1.2.
Equity-type securities As at 31 December 2017, the equitytype securities for US insurance nonseparate account operations amounted to 946 million 2016: 1,323 million.
For these operations, the longerterm rates of return for income and capital applied in the years indicated, which reflect the combination of the average riskfree rates over the year and appropriate risk premiums are as follows: 2017 2016 Equitytype securities such as common and preferred stock and portfolio holdings in mutual funds 6.1% to 6.5% 5.5% to 6.5% Other equitytype securities such as investments in limited partnerships and private equity funds 8.1% to 8.5% 7.5% to 8.5% d UK and Europe insurance operations i Shareholder-backed annuity business For this business, policyholder liabilities are determined by reference to current interest rates.
The value movements of the assets covering liabilities are closely correlated with the related change in liabilities.
Accordingly, asset value movements are recorded within the operating results based on longerterm investment returns.
Policyholder liabilities include a margin for credit risk.
Variations between actual and best estimate expected impairments are recorded as a component of shortterm fluctuations in investment returns.
The operating result based on longerterm investment returns reflects the impact of value movements on policyholder liabilities for shareholderbacked annuity business within The Prudential Assurance Company Limited PAC after adjustments to allocate the following elements of the movement to the category of shortterm fluctuations in investment returns: The impact on credit risk provisioning of actual upgrades and downgrades during the period: Credit experience compared with assumptions: and Shortterm value movements on assets backing the capital of the business.
Credit experience reflects the impact of defaults and other similar experience, such as asset exchanges arising from debt restructuring by issuers that include effectively an element of permanent impairment of the security held.
Positive or negative experience compared with assumptions is included within shortterm fluctuations in investment returns without further adjustment.
The effects of other changes to credit risk provisioning are included in the operating result, as is the net effect of changes to the valuation rate of interest due to portfolio rebalancing to align more closely with management benchmark.
ii Non-linked shareholder-financed business For debt securities backing nonlinked shareholderfinanced business of the UK and Europe insurance operations other than the annuity business the realised gains and losses are principally interest related.
e Fund management and other non-insurance businesses For these businesses, the particular features applicable for life assurance noted above do not apply.
For these businesses, it is inappropriate to include returns in the operating result on the basis described above.
Instead, it is appropriate to generally include realised gains and losses in the operating result with temporary unrealised gains and losses being included in shortterm fluctuations.
In some instances, it may also be appropriate to amortise realised gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments to operating results over a time period that reflects the underlying economic substance of the arrangements.

The Group uses the BlackScholes model to value all options and awards other than those which have TSR performance conditions attached some Prudential LTIP and RSP awards for which the Group uses a Monte Carlo model in order to allow for the impact of these conditions.
These models are used to calculate fair values for share options and awards at the grant date based on the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date, the amount, if any, that the employees are required to pay, the dividend yield, expected volatility, riskfree interest rates and exercise prices.
For all options and awards, the expected volatility is based on the market implied volatilities as quoted on Bloomberg.
The Prudential specific atthemoney implied volatilities are adjusted to allow for the different terms and discounted exercise price on SAYE options by using information on the volatility surface of the FTSE 100.
Riskfree interest rates are taken from government bond spot rates with projections for twoyear, threeyear and fiveyear terms to match corresponding vesting periods.
Dividend yields are determined as the average yield over a period of 12 months up to and including the date of grant.
For awards with a TSR condition, volatilities and correlations between Prudential and a basket of 15 competitor companies is required.
For grants in 2017, the average volatility for the basket of competitors was 22.93 per cent.
Correlations for the basket are calculated for each pairing from the log of daily TSR returns for the three years prior to the valuation date.
Market implied volatilities are used for both Prudential and the basket of competitors.
Changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.

The IFRS credit risk allowance made for the UK shareholderbacked fixed and linked annuity business equated to 42 basis points at 31 December 2017 2016: 43 basis points.
The allowance represented 28 per cent of the bond spread over swap rates 2016: 26 per cent.
The reserves for credit risk allowance at 31 December 2017 for the UK shareholderbacked business were 1.6 billion 2016: 1.7 billion.
Other assumption changes For the shareholderbacked business, in addition to the movement in the credit risk allowance discussed above, the net effect of routine changes to assumptions in 2017, was a credit of 173 million 2016: credit of 16 million.
This included, amongst other items, a benefit to IFRS operating profit based on longerterm investment returns of 204 million, relating to changes to annuitant mortality assumptions primarily reflecting the adoption of the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI 2015 model.
Further information on changes to mortality assumptions is given in note C4.1 d. Longevity reinsurance and other management actions A number of management actions were taken in 2017 to improve the solvency position of the UK and Europe insurance operations and further mitigate market risk, which have generated combined profits of 276 million.
Similar actions were also taken in 2016 and 2015.
Of this amount 31 million related to profit from an additional longevity reinsurance transactions covering 0.5 billion of annuity liabilities on an IFRS basis, with the balance of 245 million reflecting the effect of repositioning the fixed income portfolio and other actions.
The contribution to profit from similar longevity reinsurance and other management actions in 2016 was 332 million of which 197 million related to longevity reinsurance transactions covering 5.4 billion of IFRS annuity liabilities.
At 31 December 2017, longevity reinsurance covered 14.4 billion of IFRS annuity liabilities equivalent to 44 per cent of total annuity liabilities 2016: 14.4 billion, 42 per cent.
With-profits sub-fund For the withprofits subfund, the aggregate effect of assumption changes in 2017 was a net charge to unallocated surplus of 58 million 2016: net charge of 78 million.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 195 B Earnings performance continued B4 Tax charge On 22 December 2017, a significant US tax reform package, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted into law effective from 1 January 2018.
The tax reform package as a whole, which includes a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, and a number of specific measures affecting US life insurers, is expected to be beneficial in the longer term.
However in 2017 the changes have had an adverse impact on the tax charge attributable to shareholders in the Groups US operations and a benefit to policyholders in the withprofits fund of the UK and Europe operations, due to the requirement to remeasure deferred tax balances at the new 21 per cent rate.
The 2017 impacts on the Groups income statement and on other comprehensive income of the US tax changes are set out below and the impact on the balance sheet are set out in note C8.
a Total tax charge by nature of expense The total tax charge in the income statement is as follows: 2017 m 2016 m Current Deferred Tax charge tax tax Total Total Attributable to shareholders: Asia operations 164 89 253 256 US operations 56 564 508 66 UK and Europe 302 35 267 275 Other operations 122 122 111 Tax charge attributable to shareholders returns 288 618 906 354 Attributable to policyholders: Asia operations 92 157 249 155 UK and Europe 316 109 425 782 Tax charge attributable to policyholders returns 408 266 674 937 Total tax charge 696 884 1,580 1,291 The principal reason for the increase in the tax charge attributable to shareholders returns is a 445 million deferred tax charge arising on the remeasurement of the US net deferred tax assets from 35 per cent to 21 per cent.
The principal reason for the decrease in the tax charge attributable to policyholders returns is a smaller increase in deferred tax liabilities on unrealised gains on investments in the withprofits fund of UK and Europe compared to 2016, combined with a 92 million credit following the remeasurement of US net deferred tax liabilities in the same withprofits fund.
The reconciliation of the expected to actual tax charge attributable to shareholders is provided in b below.
The tax charge attributable to policyholders of 674 million above is equal to the profit before tax attributable to policyholders of 674 million.
This is the result of accounting for policyholder income after the deduction of expenses and movement on unallocated surpluses and on an after tax basis.

The 2017 impact of changes in local statutory tax rates relates to the remeasurement of US deferred tax balances following US tax reform attributable to both shareholders and policyholders.
The current tax charge of 696 million 2016: 1,377 million includes 59 million 2016: 53 million in respect of the tax charge for the Hong Kong operation.
The Hong Kong current tax charge is calculated as 16.5 per cent for all periods on either i 5 per cent of the net insurance premium or ii the estimated assessable profits, depending on the nature of the business written.
The total deferred tax charge credit arises as follows: 2017 m 2016 m Shortterm temporary differences 526 573 Unrealised gains and losses on investments 185 437 Balances relating to investment and insurance contracts 156 90 Unused tax losses 12 36 Capital allowances 5 4 Deferred tax charge credit 884 86 The movement in the shortterm temporary differences from a credit in 2016 of 573 million to a charge in 2017 of 526 million principally relates to the US operations due to the combination of the 445 million charge relating to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances following the US tax reform changes and a 695 million deferred tax charge relating to the amortisation of US operations derivative losses, which are spread across three years for tax purposes.
The unrealised gains and losses on investments charge is after including the 92 million benefit from remeasurement of deferred tax balances on unrealised gains of US investments in the withprofits funds of UK and Europe operations.
In 2017, a tax charge of 75 million 2016: credit of 10 million attributable to shareholders has been taken through other comprehensive income.
The 2017 charge includes a 190 million deferred tax charge primarily on unrealised gains on bonds held in the US operations partly offset by 134 million benefit relating to the remeasurement of US net deferred tax liabilities on the bonds.

Items related to taxation of life insurance businesses The 92 million reconciling item in Asia operations reflects where the basis of tax is not the accounting profits, primarily in: Hong Kong where the taxable profit is based on the net insurance premiums: and Indonesia and Philippines where investment income is subject to withholding tax at source and no further corporation tax.
It is higher than the 2016 adjustment of 20 million due to a larger proportion of profits attributable to Hong Kong.
The 238 million full year 2016: 159 million reconciling item in US operations reflects the impact of the dividend received deduction on the taxation of profits from variable annuity business.
US tax reform changes effective from 1 January 2018 are expected to reduce the level of this deduction from 2018 onwards.
Effects of results of joint ventures and associates The 55 million reconciling item arises from the accounting requirement for inclusion in the profit before tax of Prudentials share of the profits after tax from the joint ventures and associates, with no equivalent item included in Prudentials tax charge.
Irrecoverable withholding taxes The 54 million adverse reconciling items reflects withholding taxes on dividends paid by certain nonUK subsidiaries, principally Indonesia, to the UK.
The dividends are exempt from UK tax and consequently the withholding tax cannot be offset against UK tax payments.
Movements in provisions for open tax matters The complexity of the tax laws and regulations that relate to our businesses means that from time to time we may disagree with tax authorities on the technical interpretation of a particular area of tax law.
This uncertainty means that in the normal course of business the Group will have matters whereupon ultimate resolution of the uncertainty, the amount of profit subject to tax may be greater than the amounts reflected in the Groups submitted tax returns.

C3 Assets and liabilities C3.1 Group assets and liabilities measurement a Determination of fair value The fair values of the financial instruments for which fair valuation is required under IFRS are determined by the use of current market bid prices for exchangequoted investments or by using quotations from independent third parties such as brokers and pricing services or by using appropriate valuation techniques.
The estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arms length transaction.
This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.
Other than the loans which have been designated at fair value through profit or loss, the loans and receivables have been shown net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans have been estimated from discounted cash flows expected to be received.
The discount rate is updated for the market rate of interest where applicable.
The fair value of investment properties is based on market values as assessed by professionally qualified external valuers or by the Groups qualified surveyors.
The fair value of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.
The fair value of financial liabilities other than derivative financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flows of the amounts expected to be paid.
b Fair value measurement hierarchy of Group assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the statement of financial position The table below shows the assets and liabilities carried at fair value analysed by level of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defined fair value hierarchy.
This hierarchy is based on the inputs to the fair value measurement and reflects the lowest level input that is significant to that measurement.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults The fair value of the assets and liabilities in the table above, with the exception of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company, has been estimated from the discounted cash flows expected to be received or paid.
Where appropriate, the observable market interest rate has been used and the assets and liabilities are classified within level 2.
Otherwise, they are included as level 3 assets or liabilities.
During 2017, the assumptions applied within the discounted cash flow model used to value the equity release mortgage loans held by the UK insurance operations were refined to reflect developing market practice, including consideration of the Prudential Regulation Authoritys industry wide review in this area and resulting guidance.
This refinement incorporates inputs relevant to determining the discount rate that are not market observable.
As a result, these loans 1,429 million at 31 December 2017 have been transferred from level 2 to level 3 in the table above.
The fair value included for the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.
c Valuation approach for level 2 fair valued assets and liabilities A significant proportion of the Groups level 2 assets are corporate bonds, structured securities and other nonnational government debt securities.
These assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using independent pricing services or thirdparty broker quotes.
These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis on prices achieved on subsequent trades.
Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the thirdparty broker quotes.
Where pricing service providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied.
When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced directly from brokers.
Prudential seeks to obtain a number of quotes from different brokers so as to obtain the most comprehensive information available on their executability.
Where quotes are sourced directly from brokers, the price used in the valuation is normally selected from one of the quotes based on a number of factors, including the timeliness and regularity of the quotes and the accuracy of the quotes considering the spreads provided.
The selected quote is the one which best represents an executable quote for the security at the measurement date.
Generally, no adjustment is made to the prices obtained from independent third parties.
Adjustment is made in only limited circumstances, where it is determined that the thirdparty valuations obtained do not reflect fair value eg either because the value is stale and or the values are extremely diverse in range.
These are usually securities which are distressed or that could be subject to a debt restructure or where reliable market prices are no longer available due to an inactive market or market dislocation.
In these instances, prices are derived using internal valuation techniques including those as described below in this note with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The techniques used require a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Examples of such variables include an average credit spread based on the corporate bond universe and the relevant duration of the asset being valued.
Prudential determines the input assumptions based on the best available information at the measurement dates.
Securities valued in such manner are classified as level 3 where these significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Of the total level 2 debt securities of 115,141 million at 31 December 2017 2016: 116,257 million, 13,910 million are valued internally 2016: 12,708 million.
The majority of such securities are valued using matrix pricing, which is based on assessing the credit quality of the underlying borrower to derive a suitable discount rate relative to government securities of a comparable duration.
Under matrix pricing, the debt securities are priced taking the credit spreads on comparable quoted public debt securities and applying these to the equivalent debt instruments factoring in a specified liquidity premium.
The majority of the parameters used in this valuation technique are readily observable in the market and, therefore, are not subject to interpretation.

Valuation approach for level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities Financial instruments at fair value Investments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which by their nature do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions eg market illiquidity.
The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation.
These techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these instruments.
When determining the inputs into the valuation techniques used priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgements about the financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties.
Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time a significant volume of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or losses from selling the financial instrument being fair valued.
In some cases the disclosed value cannot be realised in immediate settlement of the financial instrument.
In accordance with the Groups risk management framework, the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments valued internally using standard market practices are subject to assessment against external counterparties valuations.
At 31 December 2017, the Group held 4,443 million 2016: 4,593 million of net financial instruments at fair value within level 3.
This represents 1 per cent 2016: 1 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of fair valued financial liabilities.
The net financial instruments at fair value within level 3 at 31 December 2017 include 1,983 million of loans and a corresponding 1,887 million of borrowings held by a subsidiary of the Groups UK withprofits fund, attaching to a portfolio of buytolet mortgages and other loans financed largely by external thirdparty nonrecourse borrowings see note C3.3 c for further details.
The Groups exposure is limited to the investment held by the UK withprofits fund, rather than to the individual loans and borrowings themselves.
The fair value movements of these loans and borrowings have no effect on shareholders profit and equity.
The most significant nonobservable inputs to the mortgage fair value are the level of future defaults and prepayments by the mortgage holders.
Also included within these amounts are loans of 2,512 million at 31 December 2017 2016: 2,672 million, measured as the loan outstanding balance, plus accrued investment income, attached to REALIC and held to back the liabilities for funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements.
The funds withheld liability of 2,664 million at 31 December 2017 2016: 2,851 million is also classified within level 3, accounted for on a fair value basis being equivalent to the carrying value of the underlying assets.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 215 C Balance sheet notes continued C3 Assets and liabilities continued C3.1 Group assets and liabilities measurement continued Excluding the loans and funds withheld liability under REALICs reinsurance arrangements as described above, which amounted to a net liability of 152 million 2016: 179 million, the level 3 fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities are 4,595 million 2016: 4,772 million.
Of this amount, a net asset of 117 million 2016: net asset of 72 million is internally valued, representing less than 0.1 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities 2016: less than 0.1 per cent.
Internal valuations are inherently more subjective than external valuations.
Included within these internally valued net asset liability are: a Debt securities of 500 million 2016: 422 million, which are either valued on a discounted cash flow method with an internally developed discount rate or on external prices adjusted to reflect the specific known conditions relating to these securities eg distressed securities or securities which were being restructured.
b Private equity and venture investments in both debt and equity securities of 217 million 2016: 956 million which are valued internally using discounted cash flows based on management information available for these investments.
The significant unobservable inputs include the determination of expected future cash flows on the investments being valued, determination of the probability of counterparty default and prepayments and the selection of appropriate discount rates.
The valuation is performed in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Valuation guidelines.
These investments were principally held by consolidated investment funds that are managed on behalf of third parties.
c Equity release mortgage loans of 366 million 2016: 276 million classified as level 2 which are valued internally using the discounted cash flow models.
The inputs that are significant to the valuation of these investments are primarily the economic assumptions, being the discount rate riskfree rate plus a liquidity premium and property values.
See below for the explanation of the transfer of these investments from level 2 into level 3 during the year.
d Liabilities of 403 million 2016: 883 million for the net asset value attributable to external unit holders in respect of the consolidated investment funds, which are nonrecourse to the Group.
These liabilities are valued by reference to the underlying assets.
e Derivative liabilities of 512 million 2016: 516 million which are valued internally using the discounted cash flow method in line with standard market practices but are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
f Other sundry individual financial investments of 81 million 2016: 93 million.
Of the internally valued net asset referred to above of 117 million 2016: net asset of 72 million : a A net asset of 67 million 2016: 315 million is held by the Groups participating funds and therefore shareholders profit and equity are not impacted by movements in the valuation of these financial instruments.
b A net liability of 184 million 2016: 243 million is held to support nonlinked shareholderbacked business.
If the value of all the level 3 instruments held to support nonlinked shareholderbacked business valued internally decreased by 10 per cent, the change in valuation would be 18 million 2016: 24 million, which would reduce shareholders equity by this amount before tax.
All this amount passes through the income statement substantially as part of shortterm fluctuations in investment returns outside of operating profit.
Other assets at fair value investment properties The investment properties of the Group are principally held by the UK and Europe insurance operations that are externally valued by professionally qualified external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS valuation standards.
An income capitalisation technique is predominantly applied for these properties.
This technique calculates the value through the yield and rental value depending on factors such as the lease length, building quality, covenant and location.
The variables used are compared to recent transactions with similar features to those of the Groups investment properties.
As the comparisons are not with properties that are virtually identical to the Groups investment properties, adjustments are made by the valuers where appropriate to the variables used.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of the properties.
e Transfers into and transfers out of levels The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of levels as of the end of each half year reporting period except for material transfers which are recognised as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
During the year, the transfers between levels within the Groups portfolio were primarily transfers from level 1 to level 2 of 1,389 million and transfers from level 2 to level 1 of 411 million.
These transfers which relate to equity securities and debt securities arose to reflect the change in the observed valuation inputs and in certain cases, the change in the level of trading activities of the securities.
In addition, in 2017, the transfers into level 3 were a net liability of 80 million and the transfers out of level 3 were 92 million.
The transfers into level 3 include a transfer from level 2 of a net liability of 83 million relating to the equity release mortgage loans of 302 million and a corresponding liability of 385 million held by the UK insurance operations that are carried at fair value through profit or loss.
During 2017, the assumptions used within the discounted cash flow model used to value these loans were refined to reflect developing market practice, including consideration of the Prudential Regulation Authoritys industrywide review in this area and resulting guidance.
As a result, the loans were reclassified as level 3.
There was no material difference in the fair value of these loans recognised in 2017, arising from this change in the valuation model.

The procedures undertaken include approval of valuation methodologies, verification processes, and resolution of significant or complex valuation issues.
In undertaking these activities the Group makes use of the extensive expertise of its asset management functions.
In addition the Group has minimum standards for independent price verification to ensure valuation accuracy is regularly independently verified.
Adherence to this policy is monitored across the business units.

222 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Jacksons portfolio of debt securities is managed proactively with credit analysts closely monitoring and reporting on the credit quality of its holdings.
Jackson continues to review its investments on a casebycase basis to determine whether any decline in fair value represents an impairment.
In addition, investments in structured securities are subject to a rigorous review of their future estimated cash flows, including expected and stress case scenarios, to identify potential shortfalls in contractual payments both interest and principal.
Impairment charges are recorded on structured securities when the Company forecasts a contractual payment shortfall.
Situations where such a shortfall would not lead to a recognition of a loss are rare.
However, some structured securities do not have a single determined set of future cash flows and instead, there can be a reasonable range of estimates that could potentially emerge.
With this variability, there could be instances where the projected cash flow shortfall under managements base case set of assumptions is so minor that relatively small and justifiable changes to the base case assumptions would eliminate the need for an impairment loss to be recognised.
The impairment loss reflects the difference between the fair value and book value.
In 2017, the Group realised gross losses on sales of availableforsale securities of 155 million 2016: 152 million with 97 per cent 2016: 59 per cent of these losses related to the disposal of fixed maturity securities of the top 10 individual issuers, which were disposed of as part of risk reduction programmes intended to limit future credit loss exposure.
Of the 155 million 2016: 152 million, 3 million 2016: 94 million relates to losses on sales of impaired and deteriorating securities.
The effect of changes in the key assumptions that underpin the assessment of whether impairment has taken place depends on the factors described in note A3.1.
A key indicator of whether such impairment may arise in future, and the potential amounts at risk, is the profile of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities accounted for on an availableforsale basis by reference to the time periods by which the securities have been held continuously in an unrealised loss position and by reference to the maturity date of the securities concerned.
For 2017, the amount of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities classified as availableforsale under IFRS in an unrealised loss position was 106 million 2016: 675 million.
Note B1.2 provides further details on the impairment charges and unrealised losses of Jacksons availableforsale securities.
C3.3 Loans portfolio a Overview of loans portfolio Loans are accounted for at amortised cost net of impairment except for: Certain mortgage loans which have been designated at fair value through profit or loss of the UK and Europe insurance operations as this loan portfolio is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis: and Certain policy loans of the US insurance operations that are held to back liabilities for funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements and are also accounted on a fair value basis.

All other policy loans are accounted for at amortised cost, less any impairment.
Other loans held in UK withprofits funds are commercial loans and comprise mainly syndicated loans.
The majority of other loans in shareholderbacked business in Asia are commercial loans held by the Malaysia operation and which are all investment graded by two local rating agencies.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 223 C Balance sheet notes continued C3 Assets and liabilities continued C3.3 Loans portfolio continued b Additional information on US mortgage loans In the US, mortgage loans are all commercial mortgage loans that are secured by the following property types: industrial, multifamily residential, suburban office, retail or hotel.
The US insurance operations commercial mortgage loan portfolio does not include any singlefamily residential mortgage loans and is therefore not exposed to the same risk of defaults associated with residential subprime mortgage loans.
The average loan size is 12.6 million 2016: 12.4 million.
The portfolio has a current estimated average loan to value of 55 per cent 2016: 59 per cent.
At 31 December 2017, Jackson had no mortgage loans where the contractual terms of the agreements had been restructured 2016: none.
c Additional information on UK mortgage loans During 2017, the UK withprofits fund invested in an entity that holds a portfolio of buytolet mortgage loans.
The vehicle financed its acquisitions through the issue of debt instruments, largely to external parties, securitised upon the loans acquired.
These thirdparty borrowings have no recourse to any other assets of the Group and the Groups exposure is limited to the amount invested by the UK with profits fund.
By carrying value, 99.98 per cent of the 1,681 million 2016: 96.29 per cent of 1,642 million mortgage loans held by the UK shareholderbacked business relates to lifetime equity release mortgage business which has an average loan to property value of 31 per cent 2016: 30 per cent.

The Group has no cash flow hedges and in general, contractual maturities are not considered essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows for these instruments.
The only exception is certain identified interest rate swaps which are fully expected to be held until maturity solely for the purposes of matching cash flows on separately held assets and liabilities.
For these instruments the undiscounted cash flows including contractual interest amounts due to be paid under the swap contract assuming conditions are consistent with those at year end are included in the column relating to the contractual maturity of the derivative.
Maturity analysis of investment contracts The table below shows the maturity profile for investment contracts on undiscounted cash flow projections of expected benefit payments.
bn Total After 1 After 5 After 10 After 15 undisTotal 1 year year to years to years to years to Over counted carrying or less 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years 20 years value value 2017 8 29 27 19 13 14 110 83 2016 6 24 23 16 11 9 89 73 Most investment contracts have options to surrender early, often subject to surrender or other penalties.
Therefore, most contracts can be said to have a contractual maturity of less than one year, but the additional charges and term of the contracts mean these are unlikely to be exercised in practice and the more useful information is to present information on expected payment.
The maturity profile above excludes certain corporate unitlinked business with gross policyholder liabilities of 12 billion 2016: 11 billion which have no stated maturity but which are repayable on demand.
The vast majority of the Groups financial assets are held to back the Groups policyholder liabilities.
Although asset liability matching is an important component of managing policyholder liabilities both those classified as insurance and those classified as investments, this profile is mainly relevant for managing market risk rather than liquidity risk.
Within each business unit this asset liability matching is performed on a portfoliobyportfolio basis.
In terms of liquidity risk, a large proportion of the policyholder liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender charges, meaning that many of the Groups liabilities are expected to be held for the long term.
Much of the Groups investment portfolios are in marketable securities, which can therefore be converted quickly to liquid assets.
For the reasons provided above, an analysis of the Groups assets by contractual maturity is not considered appropriate to evaluate the nature and extent of the Groups liquidity risk.
ii Credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk of financial instruments before any allowance for collateral or allocation of losses to policyholders is represented by the carrying value of financial instruments on the balance sheet that have exposures to credit risk comprising cash and cash equivalents, deposits, debt securities, loans and derivative assets, and other debtors, the carrying value of which are disclosed at the start of this note and note C3.4 b below for derivative assets.
The collateral in place in relation to derivatives is described in note C3.4 c below.
Note C3.3 describes the security for these loans held by the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is further discussed in note C7 below.
Of the total loans and receivables held, 23 million 2016: 27 million are past their due date but are not impaired.
Of the total past due but not impaired, 17 million are less than one year past their due date 2016: 20 million.
The Group expects full recovery of these loans and receivables.
Financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated amounted to 22 million 2016: 27 million.
In addition, during 2017 and 2016 the Group did not take possession of any other collateral held as security.
Further details of collateral and pledges are provided in note C3.4 c below.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults iii Foreign exchange risk As at 31 December 2017, the Group held 24 per cent 2016: 23 per cent and 16 per cent 2016: 12 per cent of its financial assets and financial liabilities respectively, in currencies, mainly US dollar and Euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit.
Of these financial assets, 52 per cent 2016: 52 per cent are held by the PAC withprofits fund, allowing the fund to obtain exposure to foreign equity markets.
Of these financial liabilities, 28 per cent 2016: 28 per cent are held by the PAC withprofits fund, mainly relating to foreign currency borrowings.
The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts note C3.4 b below.
The amount of exchange loss recognised in the income statement in 2017, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, is 112 million 2016: 1,005 million gain.
This constitutes 1 million gain 2016: 0.4 million gain on Medium Term Notes liabilities and 113 million of net loss 2016: 1,005 million net gain, mainly arising on investments of the PAC withprofits fund.
The gains losses on Medium Term Notes liabilities are fully offset by value movements on crosscurrency swaps, which are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
b Derivatives and hedging Derivatives The Group enters into a variety of exchange traded and overthecounter derivative financial instruments, including futures, options, forward currency contracts and swaps such as interest rate swaps, crosscurrency swaps, swaptions and credit default swaps.
All overthecounter derivative transactions, with the exception of some Asia transactions, are conducted under standardised ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc master agreements and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.
Under Article 11 of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation on derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories EMIR and Commission Delegated Regulation EU 2016 2251 supplementing EMIR, market participants transacting in noncleared OTC derivatives are required to exchange collateral to cover variation and initial margin.
However, trades between counterparties belonging to the same group are exempt from these margin requirements subject to certain criteria.
Prudential Capital plc Legal Entity Identifier reference LEI CHW8NHK268SFPTV63Z64 has entered into such derivative agreements with the following five entities in the Group.
These counterparty pairings meet the criteria to be eligible for intragroup exemptions to the margin requirements and have been approved by the Financial Conduct Authority: 31 Dec 2017 Type of Aggregate notional Counterparty Legal Entity Identifier LEI Relationship between parties exemption of OTC derivatives contract m Prudential plc 5493001Z3ZE83NG Part of the same group Full 3,615 K8Y12 holding company Prudential Holdings Limited 549300JVAI8CZD4 Part of the same group Full 110 HD451 holding company Prudential US HoldCo 1 Limited 549300JNYGDP2X Part of the same group Full 3,123 OLWR47 holding company Prudential Corporation Holdings Limited 549300KDOPLFHA Part of the same group Full 822 W51H26 holding company Prudential Lifetime Mortgages Limited 5493001GSK4HF84 Part of the same group Full 71 IOB02 holding company Derivatives are used for efficient portfolio management to obtain cost effective and efficient management of exposure to various markets in accordance with the Groups investment strategies and to manage exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other business risks.
The Group also uses interest rate derivatives to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.
In particular: UK withprofits funds use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risks.
For UK annuity business derivatives are used to assist with asset and liability cash flow matching: US operations and some of the UK and Europe operations hold large amounts of interestrate sensitive investments that contain credit risks on which a certain level of defaults is expected.
These businesses have purchased some swaptions to manage the default risk on certain underlying assets and hence reduce the amount of regulatory capital held to support the assets: and Some products, especially in the US, have guarantee features linked to equity indices.
A mismatch between guaranteed product liabilities and the performance of the underlying assets exposes the Group to equity index risk.
In order to mitigate this risk, the relevant business units purchase swaptions, equity options and futures to better match asset performance with liabilities under equityindexed products.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 227 C Balance sheet notes continued C3 Assets and liabilities continued C3.4 Financial instruments additional information continued Hedging The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of the following net investment hedges under IAS 39.
At 31 December 2017, the Group has designated perpetual subordinated capital securities totalling US$4.3 billion 2016: US$4.5 billion as a net investment hedge to hedge the currency risks related to the net investment in Jackson.
The carrying value of the subordinated capital securities was 3,140 million as at 31 December 2017 2016: 3,644 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 325 million 2016: loss of 389 million on translation of the borrowings to pounds sterling at the statement of financial position date is recognised in the translation reserve in shareholders equity.
This net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective.
The Group has no cash flow hedges or fair value hedges in place.
c Derecognition, collateral and offsetting Securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements The Group has entered into securities lending including repurchase agreements whereby blocks of securities are loaned to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms.
Typically, the value of collateral assets granted to the Group in these transactions is in excess of the value of securities lent, with the excess determined by the quality of the collateral assets granted.
Collateral requirements are calculated on a daily basis.
The loaned securities are not removed from the Groups consolidated statement of financial position, rather they are retained within the appropriate investment classification.
Collateral typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities and letters of credit.
At 31 December 2017, the Group has 8,232 million 2016: 8,545 million of lent securities and assets subject to repurchase agreements, of which 8,182 million 2016: 8,113 million related to the PAC withprofits fund.
The cash and securities collateral held or pledged under such agreements were 8,733 million 2016: 9,086 million of which 8,679 million 2016: 8,653 million was held by the PAC withprofits fund.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the securities.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of these transactions was 10,550 million 2016: 9,319 million.

Notes a Net flows improved from negative 2,527 million in 2016 to positive 736 million in 2017, due primarily to higher premium flows into our withprofits funds following increased sales into withprofits savings and retirement products.
This has been offset by lower premiums into our annuity business following our withdrawal from this market in the UK.
The level of inflows outflows for unitlinked business remains subject to annual variation as it is driven by corporate pension schemes with transfers in or out from a small number of schemes influencing the level of flows in the period.

The assumptions used are based on standard population mortality tables PCMA08 PCFA08 for males females in 2017 and PCMA00 PCFA00 in 2016, with an allowance for expected future mortality improvements.
The standard population tables are adjusted to reflect the features of the Companys portfolio.
For 2017 these portfoliospecific adjustments have been revised so that adjustments are now applied on a per policy basis, rather than across larger groupings, and therefore disclosure of broad percentage adjustments to the standard tables would no longer appropriately reflect the methodology applied.
Where annuities have been sold on an enhanced basis to impaired lives, an adjustment is made for the additional expected mortality.
New mortality projection models are released regularly by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI.
The CMI 2015 model was used to produce the 2017 results and the CMI 2014 model was used to produce the 2016 results, calibrated to reflect the Companys view of future mortality improvements.
The tables and range of percentages used are summarised in the table below: CMI Model, with calibration to reflect future mortality improvements 2017 CMI 2015 For males: with a long-term improvement rate of 2.25% pa For females: with a long-term improvement rate of 2.00% pa 2016 CMI 2014 For males: with a longterm improvement rate of 2.25% pa For females: with a longterm improvement rate of 1.50% pa In 2016, for both males and females, the initial rates of mortality improvement in the CMI model 2014 were uplifted by 0.25 per cent per annum.
For annuities in deferment, the tables used were AM92 four years males and AF92 four years females for 2017 and 2016.

annuities For fixed interest securities the internal continued rate of return of the assets backing the liabilities is used.
Properties are valued using the lower of the rental yield and the redemption yield, and for equities it is the greater of the dividend yield and the average of the dividend yield and the earnings yield.
An adjustment is made to the yield on nonriskfree fixed interest securities and property to reflect credit risk.
Credit risk For IFRS reporting, the results for UK shareholderbacked annuity business are particularly sensitive to the allowances made for credit risk on fixed interest securities.
Further details on credit risk allowance are provided in note B3 c. Unit-linked UK and Europe insurance There are no guaranteed maturity For unitlinked contracts the attaching operations also have a book values or guaranteed annuity liability reflects the unit value of unitlinked policies.
options on unitlinked policies obligation and, in the case of policies except for minor amounts for classified as insurance contracts, certain policies linked to cash provision for expenses and mortality units within SAIF.
The latter component is determined by applying mortality assumptions on a basis that is appropriate for the policyholder profile.
For those contracts where the level of insurance risk is insignificant, the assets and liabilities arising under the contracts are distinguished between those that relate to the financial instrument liability and acquisition costs and deferred income that relate to the component of the contract that relates to investment management.
Acquisition costs and deferred income are recognised consistent with the level of service provision in line with the requirements of IAS 18.
To calculate the nonunit reserves for linked business, assumptions have been set for the gross unit growth rate and the rate of inflation of maintenance expenses, as well as for the valuation interest rate.

The WPSFs profits, apportioned 90 per cent to its policyholders and 10 per cent to shareholders as surplus for distribution, are determined via the annual actuarial valuation.
Application of significant judgement Determining bonuses using the table described in the material features table above requires the PAC Board to apply significant judgement in many respects, including in particular the following: Determining what constitutes fair treatment of customers: Smoothing of investment returns: and Determining at what level to set bonuses to ensure that they are competitive.
Key assumptions The overall rate of return on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences in bonus rates, subject to the smoothing described below.
Prudential determines the assumptions to apply in respect of these factors, including the effects of reasonably likely changes in key assumptions, in the context of the overarching discretionary and smoothing framework that applies to its withprofits business.
As such, it is not possible to specifically quantify the effects of each of these assumptions, or of reasonably likely changes in these assumptions.
Prudentials approach, in applying significant judgement and discretion in relation to determining bonus rates, is consistent conceptually with the approach adopted by other firms that manage a withprofits business and is also consistent with the requirements of the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM that are applied in the management of their withprofits funds.
In accordance with industrywide regulatory requirements, the PAC Board has appointed: A Chief Actuary who provides the PAC Board with all actuarial advice: A WithProfits Actuary whose specific duty is to advise the PAC Board on the reasonableness and proportionality of the manner in which its discretion has been exercised in applying the Principles and Practices of Financial Management and the manner in which any conflicting interests have been addressed: and A WithProfits Committee of independent individuals, which assesses the degree of compliance with the PPFM and the manner in which conflicting rights have been addressed.
Determination of bonus rates In determining bonus rates for the UK withprofits policies, smoothing is applied to the allocation of the overall earnings of the UK withprofits fund of which the investment return is a significant element.
The degree of smoothing is illustrated numerically by comparing in the following table the relatively smoothed level of policyholder bonuses declared as part of the surplus for distribution, with the more volatile movement in investment return and other items of income and expenditure of the UK component of the PAC withprofits fund for each year presented.

These goodwill amounts are not individually material.
Impairment testing Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other groups of assets and thus is assigned to cashgenerating units for the purposes of impairment testing.
These cashgenerating units are based upon how management monitors the business and represent the lowest level to which goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Assessment of whether goodwill may be impaired Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the cashgenerating units carrying amount, including any goodwill, with its recoverable amount.
With the exception of M&G, the goodwill attributable to shareholders mainly relates to acquired life businesses.
The Company routinely compares the aggregate of net asset value and acquired goodwill on an IFRS basis of acquired life business with the value of the current inforce business as determined using the EEV methodology.
Any excess of IFRS over EEV carrying value is then compared with EEV basis value of current and projected future new business to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill in the IFRS statement of financial position may be impaired.
The methodology and assumptions underpinning the Groups EEV basis of reporting are included in the EEV basis supplementary information in this Annual Report.
Goodwill for venture fund investments is tested for impairment by comparing the businesss carrying value, including goodwill to its recoverable amount fair value less costs to sell.
M&G The recoverable amount for the M&G business which is now part of the UK and Europe operating segment has been determined by calculating the value in use of M&G Group Limited and its subsidiaries considered to be a cashgenerating unit during 2017.
This has been calculated by aggregating the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the M&G business.
The discounted cash flow valuation has been based on a threeyear plan prepared by M&G, and approved by management, and cash flow projections for later years.
The value in use is particularly sensitive to a number of key assumptions as follows: i The set of economic, market and business assumptions used to derive the threeyear plan.
The direct and secondary effects of recent developments, such as changes in global equity markets and trends in fund flows, are considered by management in arriving at the expectations for the final projections for the plan: ii T he assumed growth rate on forecast cash flows beyond the terminal year of the plan after considering expected future and past growth rates.
A growth rate of 1.7 per cent 2016: 2.0 per cent has been used to extrapolate beyond the plan period: iii T he risk discount rate.
Differing discount rates have been applied in accordance with the nature of the individual component businesses.
For the most material component retail and institutional business, a risk discount rate of 12 per cent 2016: 12 per cent has been applied to posttax cash flows.
The pretax risk discount rate was 15 per cent 2016: 16 per cent : and iv That asset management contracts continue on similar terms.
Management believes that any reasonable change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of M&G to fall below its carrying amount.

These adjustments reflect movement from period to period, in the changes to the pattern of reported gross profits that would have occurred if the assets reflected in the statement of financial position had been sold, crystallising the unrealised gains and losses, and the proceeds reinvested at the yields currently available in the market.
At 31 December 2017, the cumulative shadow DAC balance as shown in the table above was negative 289 million 2016: negative 237 million.
Sensitivity of amortisation charge The amortisation charge to the income statement is reflected in both operating profit and shortterm fluctuations in investment returns.
The amortisation charge to the operating profit in a reporting period comprises: i A core amount that reflects a relatively stable proportion of underlying premiums or profit: and ii An element of acceleration or deceleration arising from market movements differing from expectations.
In periods where the cap and floor feature of the mean reversion technique which is used for moderating the effect of shortterm volatility in investment returns are not relevant, the technique operates to dampen the second element above.
Nevertheless, extreme market movements can cause material acceleration or deceleration of amortisation in spite of this dampening effect.
Furthermore, in those periods where the cap or floor is relevant, the mean reversion technique provides no further dampening and additional volatility may result.
In 2017, the DAC amortisation charge for operating profit was determined after including a credit for decelerated amortisation of 86 million 2016: credit for decelerated amortisation of 93 million.
The 2017 amount primarily reflects the impact of the positive separate account performance, which is higher than the assumed level for the year.
The application of the mean reversion formula, described in note A3.1 has the effect of dampening the impact of equity market movements on DAC amortisation while the mean reversion assumption lies within the corridor.
In 2018, it would take approximate movements in separate account values of more than either negative 32 per cent or positive 37 per cent for the mean reversion assumption to move outside the corridor.

The financial and insurance assets and liabilities on the Groups balance sheet are, to varying degrees, subject to market and insurance risk and other changes of experience assumptions that may have a material effect on IFRS basis profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The market and insurance risks, including how they affect Groups operations and how these are managed are discussed in the Risk report referred to above.
The most significant items that the IFRS shareholders profit or loss and shareholders equity for the Groups life assurance business are sensitive to, are shown in the following tables.
The distinction between direct and indirect exposure is not intended to indicate the relative size of the sensitivity.

The sensitivity analyses provided show the effect on profit or loss and shareholders equity to changes in the relevant risk variables, all of which are reasonably possible at the relevant balance sheet date.
In the equity risk sensitivity analysis shown below, the Group has considered the impact of an instantaneous 20 per cent fall in equity markets.
If equity markets were to fall by more than 20 per cent, the Group believes that this would not be an instantaneous fall but rather would be expected to occur over a period of time during which the Group would be able to put mitigating management actions in place.
In addition, the equity risk sensitivity analysis provided assumed that all equity indices fall by the same percentage.
Impact of diversification on risk exposure The Group benefits from diversification benefits achieved through the geographical spread of the Groups operations and, within those operations, through a broad mix of product types.
Relevant correlation factors include: Correlation across geographic regions: Financial risk factors: and Nonfinancial risk factors.
Correlation across risk factors: Longevity risk: Expenses: Persistency: and Other risks.
The sensitivities below do not reflect that assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time any actual market movement occurs.
There are strategies in place to minimise the exposure to market fluctuations.
For example, as market indices fluctuate, Prudential would take certain actions including selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation and adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders.
In addition, these analyses do not consider the effect of market changes on new business generated in the future.
Other limitations on the sensitivities include: the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent Prudentials view of reasonably possible nearterm market changes and that cannot be predicted with any certainty: the assumption that interest rates in all countries move identically: the assumption that all global currencies move in tandem with the US dollar against pound sterling: and the lack of consideration of the interrelation of interest rates, equity markets and foreign currency exchange rates.

The Groups exposure to market risk arising from its Asia operations is therefore at modest levels.
This reflects the fact that the Asia operations have a balanced portfolio of withprofits, unitlinked and other types of business.
In Asia, adverse persistency experience can impact the IFRS profitability of certain types of business written in the region.
This risk is managed at a business unit level through regular monitoring of experience and the implementation of management actions as necessary.
These actions could include product enhancements, increased management focus on premium collection, as well as other customer retention efforts.
The potential financial impact of lapses is often mitigated through the specific features of the products, eg surrender charges, or through the availability of premium holiday or partial withdrawal policy features.
In summary, for Asia operations, the operating profit based on longerterm investment returns is mainly affected by the impact of market levels on unitlinked persistency, and other insurance risks.
At the total IFRS profit level the Asia result is affected by shortterm value movements on the asset portfolio for nonlinked shareholderbacked business.
i Sensitivity to risks other than foreign exchange risk Interest rate risk Excluding its withprofits and unitlinked businesses, the results of the Asia business are sensitive to the movements in interest rates.
For the purposes of analysing sensitivity to variations in interest rates, reference has been made to the movements in the 10year government bond rates of the territories.
At 31 December 2017, 10year government bond rates vary from territory to territory and range from 1.0 per cent to 7.5 per cent 2016: 1.2 per cent to 8.1 per cent.
For the sensitivity analysis as shown in the table below, the reasonably possible interest rate movement used is 1 per cent for all territories.
The estimated sensitivity to the decrease and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 2017 m 2016 m Decrease Increase Decrease Increase of 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 2 443 213 509 Related deferred tax where applicable 7 20 41 62 Net effect on profit and shareholders equity 5 423 172 447 The pretax impacts, if they arose, would mostly be recorded within the category shortterm fluctuations in investments returns in the Groups segmental analysis of profit before tax.
The degree of sensitivity of the results of the nonlinked shareholderbacked business of the Asia operations to movements in interest rates depends upon the degree to which the liabilities under the grandfathered IFRS 4 measurement basis reflects market interest rates from periodtoperiod.
For example for those countries, such as those applying US GAAP, the results can be more sensitive as the effect of interest rate movements on the backing investments may not be offset by liability movements.
In addition, the degree of sensitivity of the results shown in the table above is dependent on the interest rate level at that point of time.
The low interest rates in certain countries have had an adverse impact on the degree of sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates.
An additional factor to the direction of the sensitivity of the Asia operations as a whole is movement in the country mix.
Equity price risk The nonlinked shareholderbacked business has limited exposure to equity and property investment 31 December 2017: 1,764 million.
Generally changes in equity and property investment values are not directly offset by movements in nonlinked policyholder liabilities.
The estimated sensitivity to a 10 per cent and 20 per cent change in equity and property prices for shareholderbacked Asia other business including those held by the Groups joint venture and associate businesses, which would be reflected in the shortterm fluctuation component of the Groups segmental analysis of profit before tax, at 31 December 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 2017 m 2016 m Decrease Decrease of 20% of 10% of 20% of 10% Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 478 239 386 192 Related deferred tax where applicable 7 4 4 2 Net effect on profit and shareholders' equity 471 235 382 190 A 10 or 20 per cent increase in their value would have an approximately equal and opposite effect on profit and shareholders equity to the sensitivities shown above.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 261 C Balance sheet notes continued C7 Risk and sensitivity analysis continued C7.2 Asia insurance operations continued Insurance risk Many of the business units in Asia are exposed to mortality morbidity risk and provision is made within policyholder liabilities on a prudent regulatory basis to cover the potential exposure.
If these prudent assumptions were strengthened by 5 per cent then it is estimated that posttax profit and shareholders equity would be decreased by approximately 66 million 2016: 61 million.
Mortality and morbidity have a symmetrical effect on the portfolio and any weakening of these assumptions would have a similar equal and opposite impact.
ii Sensitivity to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Asia insurance operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
For 2017, the rates for the most significant operations are given in note A1.
A 10 per cent increase strengthening of the pound sterling or decrease weakening of the pound sterling in these rates would have reduced or increased profit before tax attributable to shareholders, profit for the year and shareholders equity, excluding goodwill attributable to Asia insurance operations respectively as follows: A 10% increase in local A 10% decrease in local currency to exchange rates currency to exchange rates 2017 m 2016 m 2017 m 2016 m Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 155 97 189 118 Profit for the year 135 77 165 94 Shareholders equity, excluding goodwill, attributable to Asia operations 492 442 601 540 C7.3 US insurance operations Exposure and sensitivity of IFRS basis profit and shareholders equity to market and other risks Jacksons reported operating profit based on longerterm investment returns is sensitive to market conditions, both with respect to income earned on spreadbased products and indirectly with respect to income earned on variable annuity asset management fees.
Jacksons main exposures to market risk are to interest rate risk and equity risk.
Jackson is exposed primarily to the following risks: Risks Risk of loss Equity risk Related to the incidence of benefits related to guarantees issued in connection with its variable annuity contracts: and Related to meeting contractual accumulation requirements in fixed index annuity contracts.
Interest rate risk Related to meeting guaranteed rates of accumulation on fixed annuity products following a sustained fall in interest rates: Related to increases in the present value of projected benefits related to guarantees issued in connection with its variable annuity contracts following a sustained fall in interest rates especially if in conjunction with a fall in equity markets: Related to the surrender value guarantee features attached to the Companys fixed annuity products and to policyholder withdrawals following a sharp and sustained increase in interest rates: and The risk of mismatch between the expected duration of certain annuity liabilities and prepayment risk and extension risk inherent in mortgagebacked securities.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Jacksons derivative programme is used to manage interest rate risk associated with a broad range of products and equity market risk attaching to its equitybased products.
Movements in equity markets, equity volatility, interest rates and credit spreads materially affect the carrying value of derivatives that are used to manage the liabilities to policyholders and backing investment assets.
Movements in the carrying value of derivatives combined with the use of US GAAP measurement as grandfathered under IFRS 4 for the insurance contracts assets and liabilities, which is largely insensitive to current period market movements mean that the Jackson total profit ie including shortterm fluctuations in investment returns is sensitive to market movements.
In addition to these effects the Jackson shareholders equity is sensitive to the impact of interest rate and credit spread movements on the value of fixed income securities.
Movements in unrealised appreciation on these securities are included as movement in shareholders equity ie outside the income statement.
Jackson enters into financial derivative transactions, including those noted below to reduce and manage business risks.
These transactions manage the risk of a change in the value, yield, price, cash flows or quantity of, or a degree of exposure with respect to assets, liabilities or future cash flows, which Jackson has acquired or incurred.
Jackson uses freestanding derivative instruments for hedging purposes.
Additionally, certain liabilities, primarily trust instruments supported by funding agreements, fixed index annuities, certain variable annuity guaranteed benefit features and reinsured Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit variable annuity features are similar to derivatives.
Jackson does not account for such items as either fair value or cash flow hedges as might be permitted if the specific hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 were followed.
Financial derivatives, including derivatives embedded in certain host liabilities that have been separated for accounting and financial reporting purposes are carried at fair value.
The principal types of derivatives used by Jackson and their purpose are as follows: Derivative Purpose Interest rate swaps These generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating payments over the period for which Jackson holds the instrument without an exchange of the underlying principal amount.
These agreements are used to hedge Jacksons exposure to movements in interest rates.
Swaption contracts These contracts provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to require the writer to pay the present value of a longduration interest rate swap at future exercise dates.
Jackson both purchases and writes swaptions in order to hedge against significant movements in interest rates.
Treasury futures These derivatives are used to hedge Jacksons exposure to movements in interest rates.
contracts Equity index futures These derivatives including various call and put options and options contingent on interest rates and currency contracts and equity exchange rates are used to hedge Jacksons obligations associated with its issuance of certain VA guarantees.
index options Some of these annuities and guarantees contain embedded options that are fair valued for financial reporting purposes.
Crosscurrency swaps Crosscurrency swaps, which embody spot and forward currency swaps and additionally, in some cases, interest rate swaps and equity index swaps, are entered into for the purpose of hedging Jacksons foreign currency denominated funding agreements supporting trust instrument obligations.
Credit default swaps These swaps represent agreements under which Jackson has purchased default protection on certain underlying corporate bonds held in its portfolio.
These contracts allow Jackson to sell the protected bonds at par value to the counterparty if a default event occurs in exchange for periodic payments made by Jackson for the life of the agreement.
Jackson does not write default protection using credit derivatives.
The estimated sensitivity of Jacksons profit and shareholders equity to equity and interest rate risks provided below is net of the related changes in amortisation of DAC.
The effect on the related changes in amortisation of DAC provided is based on the current grandfathered US GAAP DAC basis but does not include any effect from an acceleration or deceleration of amortisation of DAC.

Ranges shown based on simple interest.
The upper limits of 5 per cent or 8 per cent simple interest are approximately equal to 4.1 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, on a compound interest basis over a typical 10year bonus period.
For example 1 10 x 0.05 is similar to 1.04 growing at a compound rate of 4 per cent for a further nine years.
The GMIB guarantees are essentially fully reinsured.

This risk is managed using an equity hedging programme to minimise the risk of a significant economic impact as a result of increases or decreases in equity market levels while taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures in Jacksons operations.
Jackson purchases futures and options that hedge the risks inherent in these products, while also considering the impact of rising and falling guaranteed benefit fees.
Due to the nature and the valuation under IFRS of the freestanding derivatives and the variable annuity guarantee features, this hedge, while highly effective on an economic basis, would not be completely mute in the financial reporting as the immediate impact of equity market movements reset the freestanding derivatives immediately while the hedged liabilities reset more slowly and fees are recognised prospectively in the period in which they are earned.
In addition to the exposure explained above, Jackson is also exposed to equity risk from its holding of equity securities, partnerships in investment pools and other financial derivatives.
At 31 December 2017, the estimated sensitivity of Jacksons profit and shareholders equity to immediate increases and decreases in equity markets is shown below.
The sensitivities are shown net of related changes in DAC amortisation.

In addition, the sensitivity movements shown include those relating to the fixed index annuity and the reinsurance of GMIB guarantees.
The above table provides sensitivity movements as at a point in time while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon the volume of new product sales and lapses, changes to the derivative portfolio, correlation of market returns and various other factors including volatility, interest rates and elapsed time.
The directional movements in the sensitivities reflect the hedging programme in place at 31 December 2017 and 2016. www.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 265 C Balance sheet notes continued C7 Risk and sensitivity analysis continued C7.3 US insurance operations continued ii Sensitivity to interest rate risk Except in the circumstances of interest rate scenarios where the guarantee rates included in contract terms are higher than crediting rates that can be supported from assets held to cover liabilities, the accounting measurement of fixed annuity liabilities of Jacksons products is not generally sensitive to interest rate risk.
This position derives from the nature of the products and the US GAAP basis of measurement.
The GMWB features attached to variable annuity business other than for life components are accounted for under US GAAP as embedded derivatives which are fairvalued and, therefore, will be sensitive to changes in interest rates.
Debt securities and related derivatives are marked to fair value.
Value movements on derivatives, again net of related changes to amortisation of DAC and deferred tax, are recorded within the income statement.
Fair value movements on debt securities, net of related changes to amortisation of DAC and deferred tax, are recorded within other comprehensive income.
The estimated sensitivity of these items and policyholder liabilities to a 1 per cent and 2 per cent decrease and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 2017 m 2016 m Decrease Increase Decrease Increase of 2% of 1% of 1% of 2% of 2% of 1% of 1% of 2% Profit and loss: Pretax profit effect net of related changes in amortisation of DAC 4,079 1,911 1,373 2,533 2,899 1,394 1,065 2,004 Related effect on charge for deferred tax 857 401 288 532 1,015 488 373 701 Net profit effect 3,222 1,510 1,085 2,001 1,884 906 692 1,303 Other comprehensive income: Direct effect on carrying value of debt securities net of related changes in amortisation of DAC 3,063 1,700 1,700 3,063 3,364 1,883 1,883 3,364 Related effect on movement in deferred tax 643 357 357 643 1,177 659 659 1,177 Net effect 2,420 1,343 1,343 2,420 2,187 1,224 1,224 2,187 Total net effect on shareholders' equity 802 167 258 419 303 318 532 884 These sensitivities are shown only for interest rates in isolation and do not include other movements in credit risk that may affect credit spreads and valuations of debt securities.
Similar to sensitivity to equity risk, the sensitivity movements provided in the table above are at a point in time and reflect the hedging programme in place on the balance sheet date, while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon a number of factors.
iii Sensitivity to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Groups US operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
A 10 per cent increase weakening of the dollar or decrease strengthening of the dollar in these rates would reduce or increase profit before tax attributable to shareholders, profit for the year and shareholders equity attributable to US insurance operations respectively as follows: A 10% increase in US$: A 10% decrease in US$: exchange rates exchange rates 2017 m 2016 m 2017 m 2016 m Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 54 48 66 59 Profit for the year 20 54 24 66 Shareholders equity attributable to US insurance operations 456 473 557 578 266 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults iv Other sensitivities The total profit of Jackson is sensitive to market risk on the assets covering liabilities other than variable annuity business segregated in the separate accounts.
For interestsensitive business, the key assumption is the expected longterm spread between the earned rate and the rate credited to policyholders.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges all of which are based on a combination of actual experience of Jackson, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual experience is measured by internally developed expense, mortality and persistency studies.
For variable annuity business, an assumption made is the expected longterm level of separate account returns, which for 2017 was 7.4 per cent 2016: 7.4 per cent.
The impact of using this return is reflected in two principal ways, namely: Through the projected expected gross profits that are used to determine the amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
This is applied through the use of a mean reversion technique which is described in more detail in note A3.1 above: and The required level of provision for claims for guaranteed minimum death, for life withdrawal, and income benefits.
Jackson is sensitive to mortality risk, lapse risk and other types of policyholder behaviour, such as the utilisation of its GMWB product features.
Jacksons persistency assumptions reflect a combination of recent experience for each relevant line of business and expert judgement, especially where a lack of relevant and credible experience data exists.
These assumptions vary by relevant factors, such as product, policy duration, attained age and for variable annuity lapse assumptions, the extent to which guaranteed benefits are in the money relative to policy account values.
Changes in these assumptions, which are assessed on an annual basis after considering recent experience, could have a material impact on policyholder liabilities and therefore on profit before tax.
See further information in note B1.2.
In addition, in the absence of hedging, equity and interest rate movements can both cause a loss directly or an increased future sensitivity to policyholder behaviour.
Jackson has an extensive derivative programme that seeks to manage the exposure to such altered equity markets and interest rates.
C7.4 UK and Europe insurance operations Exposure and sensitivity of IFRS basis profit and shareholders equity to market and other risks The IFRS basis results of the UK and Europe insurance operations are most sensitive to the following factors: Asset liability matching: Default rate experience: Mortality: Longevity assumptions: and The difference between the return on corporate bond and riskfree rate for shareholderbacked annuity business of The Prudential Assurance Company Limited.
Further details are described below.
The IFRS operating profit based on longerterm investment returns for UK and Europe insurance operations is sensitive to changes in longevity assumptions affecting the carrying value of liabilities to policyholders for UK shareholderbacked annuity business.
At the total IFRS profit level, the result is particularly sensitive to temporary value movements on assets backing the capital of the shareholder backed annuity business.
With-profits business With-profits sub-fund business The shareholder results of the UK withprofits business including nonparticipating annuity business of the withprofits subfund are only sensitive to market risk through the indirect effect of investment performance on declared policyholder bonuses.
The investment assets of PAC withprofits funds are subject to market risk.
Changes in their carrying value, net of related changes to assetshare liabilities of withprofits contracts, affect the level of unallocated surplus of the fund.
Therefore, the level of unallocated surplus is particularly sensitive to the level of investment returns on the portion of the assets that represents surplus.
However, as unallocated surplus is accounted for as a liability under IFRS, movements in its value do not affect shareholders profit and equity.
The shareholder results of the UK withprofits fund are currently oneninth of the cost of bonuses declared to withprofits policyholders.
For certain unitised withprofits products, such as the PruFund range of funds, the bonuses represent the policyholders net return based on the smoothed unit price of the selected investment fund.
Investment performance is a key driver of bonuses declared, and hence the shareholder results.
Due to the smoothed basis of bonus declaration, the sensitivity to shortterm investment performance is relatively low.
However, longterm investment performance and persistency trends may affect future shareholder transfers.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 267 C Balance sheet notes continued C7 Risk and sensitivity analysis continued C7.4 UK and Europe insurance operations continued Shareholder-backed annuity business Profits from shareholderbacked annuity business are most sensitive to: The extent to which the duration of the assets held closely matches the expected duration of the liabilities under the contracts: Actual versus expected default rates on assets held: The difference between longterm rates of return on corporate bonds and riskfree rates: The variance between actual and expected mortality experience: The extent to which changes to the assumed rate of improvements in mortality give rise to changes in the measurement of liabilities: and Changes in renewal expense levels.
In addition the level of profit is affected by change in the level of reinsurance cover.
A decrease in assumed mortality rates of 1 per cent would decrease pretax profit by approximately 66 million 2016: 67 million.
A decrease in credit default assumptions of five basis points would increase pretax profit by 198 million 2016: 200 million.
A decrease in renewal expenses excluding asset management expenses of 5 per cent would increase pretax profit by 40 million 2016: 41 million.
The effect on profit would be approximately symmetrical for changes in assumptions that are directionally opposite to those explained above.
The net effect on profit after tax and shareholders equity from all the changes in assumptions as described above would be an increase of approximately 143 million 2016: 144 million.
See C4.1 d iii for further details on mortality assumptions.
Unit-linked and other business Unitlinked and other business represents a comparatively small proportion of the inforce business of the UK and Europe insurance operations.
Due to the matching of policyholder liabilities to attaching asset value movements, the UK unitlinked business is not directly affected by market or credit risk.
The liabilities of the other business are also broadly insensitive to market risk.
Profits from unitlinked and similar contracts primarily arise from the excess of charges to policyholders for management of assets, over expenses incurred.
The former is most sensitive to the net accretion of funds under management as a function of new business and lapse and timing of death.
The accounting impact of the latter is dependent upon the amortisation of acquisition costs in line with the emergence of margins for insurance contracts and amortisation in line with service provision for the investment management component of investment contracts.
By virtue of the design features of most of the contracts which provide low levels of mortality cover, the profits are relatively insensitive to changes in mortality experience.
Sensitivity to interest rate risk and other market risk By virtue of the fund structure, product features and basis of accounting, the policyholder liabilities of the UK and Europe insurance operations are, except annuity business, not generally exposed to interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2017 annuity liabilities accounted for 98 per cent 2016: 98 per cent of UK shareholderbacked business liabilities.
For annuity business, liabilities are exposed to interest rate risk.
However, the net exposure substantially ameliorated by virtue of the close matching of assets with appropriate duration.
The level of matching from period to period can vary depending on management actions and economic factors so it is possible for a degree of mismatching profits or losses to arise.
The close matching by the Group of assets of appropriate duration to annuity liabilities is based on maintaining economic and regulatory capital.
Liabilities are measured differently under Solvency II reporting requirements than under IFRS resulting in an alteration to the assets used to measure the IFRS annuity liabilities.
As a result, IFRS has a different sensitivity to interest rate and credit risk than under Solvency II.
The estimated sensitivity of the UK nonlinked shareholderbacked business principally annuities business to a movement in interest rates is as follows: 2017 m 2016 m A A An An A A An An decrease decrease increase increase decrease decrease increase increase of 1% of 1% of 2% of 2% of 1% of 1% of 2% of 2% Carrying value of debt securities and derivatives 13,497 5,805 4,659 8,541 12,353 5,508 4,527 8,313 Policyholder liabilities 9,426 4,210 3,443 6,295 10,023 4,466 3,636 6,635 Related deferred tax effects 658 254 190 348 396 177 151 285 Net sensitivity of profit after tax and shareholders equity 3,413 1,341 1,026 1,898 1,934 865 740 1,393 268 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.

Excluding any offsetting effects on the measurement of policyholder liabilities, a fall in their value would have given rise to the following effects on pretax profit, profit after tax and shareholders equity.
2017 m 2016 m A decrease A decrease A decrease A decrease of 20% of 10% of 20% of 10% Pretax profit 332 166 326 163 Related deferred tax effects 57 28 66 33 Net sensitivity of profit after tax and shareholders equity 275 138 260 130 A 10 or 20 per cent increase in their value would have an approximately equal and opposite effect on profit and shareholders equity to the sensitivities shown above.
The market risk sensitivities shown above reflect the impact of temporary market movements, and, therefore the primary effect of such movements would, in the Groups segmental analysis of profits, be included within the shortterm fluctuations in investment returns.
C7.5 Asset management and other operations a Asset management i Sensitivities to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of Eastspring Investments and US asset management operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
The rates for the functional currencies of most significant operations are shown in note A1.
A 10 per cent increase in the relevant exchange rates strengthening of the pound sterling would have reduced reported profit before tax attributable to shareholders, and shareholders equity excluding goodwill attributable to Eastspring Investments and US asset management operations, by 30 million and 53 million respectively 2016: 12 million and 47 million, respectively.
ii Sensitivities to other financial risks for asset management operations The profits of asset management businesses are sensitive to the level of assets under management, as this significantly affects the value of management fees earned by the business in the current and future periods.
The Groups asset management operations do not hold significant investments in property or equities.
b Other operations The Group holds certain derivatives that are used to manage foreign currency movements and macroeconomic exposures.
The fair value of these derivatives is sensitive to the combined effect of movements in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation rates.
The possible permutations cover a wide range of scenarios.
For indicative purposes, a reasonably possible range of fair value movements could be plus or minus 150 million.
Other operations are sensitive to credit risk on the bridging loan portfolio of the Prudential Capital operation.
Total debt securities held at 31 December 2017 by Prudential Capital were 2,238 million 2016: 2,359 million.
Debt securities held by Prudential Capital are in general variable rate bonds and so market value is limited in sensitivity to interest rate movements and consequently any change in interest rates would not have a material impact on profit or shareholders equity.

The reduction in the US corporate income tax rate to 21 per cent from 1 January 2018 was substantively enacted on 22 December 2017.
The remeasurement to 21 per cent reduced deferred tax assets subject to US taxation by 1,587 million and deferred tax liabilities by 1,368 million.
The 219 million net reduction was reflected partly in the income statement 445 million charge attributable to shareholders and 92 million benefit to policyholders and partly through reserves in other comprehensive income 134 million benefit.

Under IAS 12, Income Taxes, deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable, that is to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
The taxation regimes applicable across the Group often apply separate rules to trading and capital profits and losses.
The distinction between temporary differences that arise from items of either a trading or capital nature may affect the recognition of deferred tax assets.

C9 Defined benefit pension schemes a Background and summary economic and IAS 19 financial positions The Groups businesses operate a number of pension schemes.
The specific features of these schemes vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which the employees are located, although they are, in general, funded by the Group and based either on a cash balance formula or on years of service and salary earned in the last year or years of employment.
The largest defined benefit scheme is the principal UK scheme, namely the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
PSPS accounts for 82 per cent 2016: 82 per cent of the underlying scheme liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The Group also operates two smaller UK defined benefit schemes in respect of Scottish Amicable SASPS and M&G M&GGPS.
In addition, there are two small defined benefit schemes in Taiwan which have negligible deficits.
Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, the Group is only able to recognise a surplus to the extent that it is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service of active members.
The Group has no unconditional right of refund to any surplus in PSPS.
Accordingly, the PSPS surplus recognised is restricted to the present value of the economic benefit to the Group from the difference between the estimated future ongoing contributions and the full future cost of service for the active members.
In contrast, the Group is able to access the surplus of SASPS and M&GGPS.
Therefore, the amounts recognised for these schemes are the IAS 19 valuation amount either a surplus or deficit.
The Group asset liability in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: 2017 m 2016 m Other Other PSPS SASPS M&GGPS schemes Total PSPS SASPS M&GGPS schemes Total note i note ii note i note ii Underlying economic surplus deficit 721 137 109 1 692 717 237 84 1 563 Less: unrecognised surplus 485 485 558 558 Economic surplus deficit including investment in Prudential insurance note iii policies 236 137 109 1 207 159 237 84 1 5 Attributable to: PAC withprofits fund 165 55 110 111 95 16 Shareholderbacked operations 71 82 109 1 97 48 142 84 1 11 Consolidation adjustment against policyholder liabilities for investment in Prudential insurance policies 151 151 134 134 IAS 19 pension asset liability on the Group statement of note iv financial position 236 137 42 1 56 159 237 50 1 129 Notes i No deficit or other funding is required for PSPS.
Deficit funding, where applicable, is apportioned in the ratio of 70 30 between the PAC withprofits fund and shareholderbacked operations following detailed considerations in 2005 of the sourcing of previous contributions.
Employer contributions for ongoing service of current employees are apportioned in the ratio relevant to current activity.
ii The deficit of SASPS has been allocated 40 per cent to the PAC withprofits fund and 60 per cent to the shareholders fund as at 31 December 2017 and 2016. iii The underlying position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential insurance policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
iv At 31 December 2017, the PSPS pension asset of 236 million 2016: 159 million and the other schemes pension liabilities of 180 million 2016: 288 million are included within Other debtors and Provisions respectively on the consolidated statement of financial position.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 271 C Balance sheet notes continued C9 Defined benefit pension schemes continued a Background and summary economic and IAS 19 financial positions continued Triennial actuarial valuations Defined benefit pension schemes in the UK are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuations every three years in order to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes in relation to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
The actuarial valuation differs from the IAS 19 accounting basis valuation in a number of respects, including the discount rate assumption where IAS 19 prescribes a rate based on highquality corporate bonds while a more prudent assumption is used for the actuarial valuation.
The information on the latest completed actuarial valuation for the UK schemes is shown in the table below: PSPS SASPS M&GGPS Last completed actuarial 5 April 2014 31 March 2017 31 December 2014 valuation date Valuation actuary, all Fellows C G Singer Jonathan Seed Paul Belok of the Institute and Faculty Towers Watson Limited Xafinity Consulting AON Hewitt Limited of Actuaries Funding level at the last 107 per cent 75 per cent 99 per cent valuation Deficit funding arrangement No deficit or other funding Deficit funding of No deficit funding required agreed with the Trustees required.

The deficit funding excluding expenses will be reviewed every three years at subsequent valuations The triennial valuations for PSPS and M&GGPS as at 5 April 2017 and 31 December 2017 respectively are currently in progress.
For PSPS, the market value of the scheme assets as at the 5 April 2014 valuation was 6,165 million.
The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the purposes of the 2014 valuation were as follows.
% Rate of increase in salaries Nil Rate of inflation: Retail Prices Index RPI 3.5 Consumer Prices Index CPI 2.8 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.8 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 Discretionary Nil Expected returns on plan assets 3.3 Mortality assumptions: The tables used for PSPS pensions in payment at 5 April 2014 were: Base post-retirement mortality For current male female pensioners 113 per cent 108 per cent of the mortality rates of the 2000 series mortality tables PNMA00 PNFA00, published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMI.
For male female nonpensioners 107 per cent 92 per cent of the 2000 series rates PNMA00 PNFA00.
Allowance for future improvements to post-retirement mortality For males females up to 2009 100 per cent 75 per cent of Medium Cohort subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 2.00 per cent per annum 1.25 per cent per annum up to age 90, decreasing linearly to zero by age 120.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Risks to which the defined benefit schemes expose the Group Responsibility of making good of any deficit that may arise in the schemes lies with the employers of the schemes, which are subsidiaries of the Group.
Accordingly, the pension schemes expose the Group to a number of risks and the most significant of which are interest rate and investment risk, inflation risk and mortality risk.
Corporate governance The Groups UK pension schemes are established under trust and are subject to UK legal requirements: this includes being subject to regulation by The Pension Regulator in accordance with the Pension Act 1995.
Each scheme has a corporate trustee to which some directors are appointed by Group employers with the remaining directors nominated by members in accordance with UK legal requirements.
The trustees have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the scheme is managed in accordance with the Trust Deed & Rules.
The trustees act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries: this includes taking appropriate account of each employers legal obligation and financial ability to support the schemes, when setting investment strategy and when agreeing funding with the employers.
The employers contribution commitments are formally updated at each triennial valuation: between valuations funding levels and employer strength continue to be monitored with the Trustees being able to bring forward the next triennial valuation if they consider it appropriate to do so.
All of the Groups three UK defined benefit pension schemes PSPS, SASPS and M&GGPS are final salary schemes, which are closed to new entrants.
The Trustees of each scheme set the general investment policy and specify any restrictions on types of investment and the degrees of divergence permitted from the benchmark, but delegate the responsibility for selection and realisation of specific investments to the Investment Managers.
The Trustees consult the Principal Employer, eg The Prudential Assurance Company for PSPS, on the investment principles, but the ultimate responsibility for the investment of the assets of the scheme lies with the Trustees.
The Trustees of each of the schemes manage the investment strategy of the scheme to achieve an acceptable balance between investing in the assets that most closely match the expected benefit payments and assets that are expected to achieve a greater return in the hope of reducing the contributions required or providing additional benefits to members.
For PSPS, a significant portion of the scheme assets are invested in liability matching assets such as bonds and gilts including indexlinked gilts to partially hedge against inflation.
In addition, PSPS has maintained a portfolio of interest rate and inflation swaps to match more closely the duration and inflation profile of its assets to its liabilities.
SASPS and M&GGPS use very limited or no derivatives to manage their risks.
The risks arising from these schemes are managed through a diversified mix of investments.
SASPS has invested in a mix of both returnseeking assets, such as equities and property and matching assets including a leveraged liability driven investment portfolio to reflect the liability profile of the scheme.
A portion of the M&GGPS assets is invested in indexlinked gilts and leveraged indexlinked gilts as part of its asset liability management.
The mix of the investments is kept under review by the Trustees of the respective schemes.
b Assumptions The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended 31 December were as follows: 2017 % 2016 % Discount rate 2.5 2.6 Rate of increase in salaries 3.1 3.2 Rate of inflation Retail prices index RPI 3.1 3.2 Consumer prices index CPI 2.1 2.2 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: PSPS: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.5 2.5 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Other schemes 3.1 3.2 The discount rate has been determined by reference to an AA corporate bond index, adjusted where applicable to allow for the difference in duration between the index and the pension liabilities.
The rate of inflation reflects the longterm assumption for UK RPI or CPI depending on the tranche of the schemes.
The calculations are based on current mortality estimates with an allowance made for future improvements in mortality.
This allowance reflected the CMIs 2014 mortality improvements model, with schemespecific calibrations.
For immediate annuities in payment, in 2017 and 2016, a longterm mortality improvement rate of 1.75 per cent per annum and 1.25 per cent per annum was applied for males and females, respectively.

Prudential has agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA to review annuities sold without advice after 1 July 2008 to its contractbased defined contribution pension customers.
The review will examine whether customers were given sufficient information about their potential eligibility to purchase an enhanced annuity, either from Prudential or another pension provider.
The FCA formally released its redress calculation methodology in early 2018 and accordingly Prudential reassessed the provision held to cover the costs of undertaking the review and any potential redress.
At 31 December 2017, following this reassessment, the gross provision was increased to 400 million 2016: 175 million, excluding any utilisation during the year.
The ultimate amount that will be expended by the Group on the review, which is currently expected to be completed in 2019, remains uncertain.
Although the Groups professional indemnity insurance is expected to mitigate the overall financial impact of this review, with potential insurance recoveries of up to 175 million, no such recovery has been factored into the provision, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

ii External capital requirements Solvency II is the Groups consolidated capital regime.
Solvency II is a riskbased solvency framework required under the European Solvency II Directive as implemented by the Prudential Regulatory Authority in the UK.
The Solvency II surplus represents the aggregated capital held by the Group less Solvency Capital Requirements.
iii Meeting of capital management objectives The Group Solvency Capital Requirement has been met during 2017.
As well as holding sufficient capital to meet Solvency II requirements at Group level, the Group also closely manages the cash it holds within its central holding companies so that it can: a Maintain flexibility, fund new opportunities and absorb shock events: b Fund dividends: and c Cover central costs and debt payments.
More details on holding company cash flows and balances are given in the section II a of the additional unaudited financial information.
While the Group at a consolidated level is subject to the Solvency II requirements, at a business unit level capital is defined by local capital regulations and local business needs.
Each of the Groups longterm business operations is capitalised to a sufficiently strong level for its individual circumstances.
The Group manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different types of liabilities in each business.
As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory regimes under which it operates, the Group employs differing methods of asset liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Stochastic modelling of assets and liabilities is undertaken in the UK, US and Asia to assess the economic capital requirements.
A stochastic approach models the interrelationship between asset and liability movements, taking into account asset correlation, management actions and policyholder behaviour under a large number of alternative economic scenarios.
In addition, reserve adequacy testing under a range of scenarios and dynamic solvency testing is carried out, including under certain scenarios mandated by the UK, US and Asia regulators.
The sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions the approach to asset liability management.
b Local capital regulations i Asia insurance operations The estimated capital position for Asia life insurance operations with reconciliation to shareholders equity is shown below: 2017 m 2016 m IFRS shareholders' equity 5,524 4,992 Adjustments to regulatory basis Unallocated surplus of withprofits funds 3,474 2,667 Deferred acquisition costs, distribution rights and goodwill of nonparticipating business not recognised for regulatory reporting 1,515 1,365 Other adjustments 2,411 1,628 Total adjustments 4,370 2,930 Total available capital resources of life assurance businesses on local regulatory bases 9,894 7,922 The capital requirements of significant operations are: China A riskbased capital, risk management and governance framework, known as the China Risk Oriented Solvency System CROSS, applies in China.
Under CROSS, insurers are required to maintain a core solvency ratio core capital over minimum capital and a comprehensive solvency ratio actual capital over minimum capital of not lower than 50 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively.
The actual capital is the difference between the admitted assets and admitted liabilities.
Hong Kong The capital requirement varies by underlying risk and duration of liabilities, but is generally determined as a percentage of mathematical reserves and capital at risk.
Mathematical reserves are based on a best estimate basis with prudent margins for adverse deviations, discounted at a valuation interest rate based on a blend between the riskadjusted portfolio yield and reinvestment rate.
Indonesia Solvency capital is determined using a riskbased capital approach.
Insurance companies in Indonesia are expected to maintain the level of net assets above 100 per cent of solvency capital.
Malaysia A riskbased capital framework applies in Malaysia.
The local regulator has set a Supervisory Target Capital Level of 130 per cent below which supervisory actions of increasing intensity will be taken.
Each insurer is also required to set its own Individual Target Capital Level to reflect its own risk profile and this is expected to be higher than the Supervisory Target Capital Level.
Singapore A riskbased capital framework applies in Singapore.
A registered insurer incorporated in Singapore is required at all times to maintain a minimum level of paidup ordinary share capital and to ensure that its financial resources are not less than the greater of i the total risk requirement arising from the assets and liabilities of the insurer, calculated in accordance with the Singapore Insurance Act: or ii a minimum amount of S$5 million Singapore dollars.
The regulator also has the authority to direct that the insurer satisfy additional capital adequacy requirements in addition to those set forth under the Singapore Insurance Act if it considers such additional requirements appropriate.

These reforms led to a 628 million reduction in the level of statutory net admitted deferred tax assets.
The regulatory framework for Jackson is governed by the requirements of the US NAIC approved RiskBased Capital standards.
Under these requirements life insurance companies report using a formulabased capital standard which includes components calculated by applying aftertax factors to various asset, premium and reserve items and a separate modelbased component for market risk associated primarily with variable annuity products.
The aftertax factors were not adjusted to reflect the impact of US Tax Reform.
At 31 December 2017, Jackson had a permitted practice in effect as granted by the local regulator allowing Jackson to carry certain interest rate swaps at book value, as if statutory hedge accounting were in place, instead of at fair value as would have been otherwise required.
Jackson is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of its interest rate swap programme pursuant to the Michigan Insurance Code.
The total effect of this permitted practice, net of tax, was to decrease statutory surplus by 355 million at 31 December 2017.
Under the equivalence provisions of Solvency II, Jackson is incorporated into the Groups Solvency II position at a level equal to available capital in excess of 250 per cent of the US local minimum riskbased capital requirement level at which corrective action commences.
iii UK and Europe insurance operations Insurance operations in the UK and Europe are subject to Solvency II capital requirements on an individual basis.
The UK solvency capital requirement has been met during 2017. iv Asset management operations regulatory and other surplus Certain asset management subsidiaries of the Group are subject to regulatory requirements.
The movement in the year of the surplus regulatory capital position of those subsidiaries, combined with the movement in the IFRS basis shareholders funds for unregulated asset management operations, is as follows: Asset management operations 2017 m 2016 m M&G Eastspring Prudential US Investments Total Total Regulatory and other surplus Beginning of year 405 205 204 814 733 Gains during the year 401 43 142 586 469 Movement in capital requirement 65 8 73 54 Capital injection 6 6 Distributions made to the parent company 322 111 433 387 Exchange and other movements 19 5 24 53 End of year 419 235 222 876 814 280 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults c Transferability of available capital In the UK PAC is required to meet the Solvency II capital requirements as a company as a whole, ie covering both its ringfenced withprofits funds and nonprofit funds.
Further, the surplus of the withprofits funds is ringfenced from the shareholder balance sheet with restrictions as to its distribution.
Distributions from the withprofits funds to shareholders continue to reflect the shareholders oneninth share of the cost of declared policyholders bonuses.
For Jackson, capital retention is maintained at a level consistent with an appropriate rating by Standard & Poors.
Currently Jackson is rated AA.
Jackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus unless prior regulatory approval is obtained.
Furthermore, dividends which exceed the greater of statutory net gain from operations less net realised investments losses for the prior year or 10 per cent of Jacksons prior year end statutory surplus, excluding any increase arising from the application of permitted practices, require prior regulatory approval.
For Asia subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels that provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the local regulatory minimum.
For ringfenced withprofits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained with distribution tied to the shareholders share of bonuses through declaration of actuarially determined surplus.
The businesses in Asia may, in general, remit dividends to UK parent entities, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the local regulatory solvency targets.
Available capital of the noninsurance business units is transferable after taking account of an appropriate level of operating capital, based on local regulatory solvency targets, over and above base liabilities.
C13 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprise Group occupied properties and tangible assets.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults D Other notes D1 Disposal of businesses On 18 May 2017, the Group announced that it had completed the sale of its life insurance subsidiary in Korea, PCA Life Insurance Co. Ltd. to Mirae Asset Life Insurance Co. Ltd. following regulatory approvals.
The transaction, announced on 10 November 2016, was for a consideration of KRW170 billion equivalent to 117 million at 17 May 2017 closing rate.
The proceeds, net of 9 million of related expenses, were 108 million.
On completion of the sale the cumulative foreign exchange translation gain of the Korea life business of 61 million, that had arisen from 2004 the year of the Groups conversion to IFRS to disposal was recycled from other comprehensive income through the profit and loss account in 2017 as required by IAS 21.
The adjustment has no net effect on shareholders equity.
The net contribution from the Korea life business to the 2017 profit after tax is the 61 million gain arising from the recycling of foreign exchange translation gains previously recognised in other comprehensive income and other elements in various line items of 5 million.
The 2016 income statement recorded a charge for remeasurement of Korea life business classified as held for sale of 238 million.
For 2016 the result for the year, including shortterm fluctuations in investment returns, together with the adjustment to the carrying value gave rise to an aggregate loss of 227 million.
To facilitate comparisons of businesses retained by the Group, the supplementary analysis of profit shown in note B1.1 shows separately the results of the Korea life business.
On 15 August 2017, the Group, through its subsidiary National Planning Holdings, Inc. NPH sold its US independent brokerdealer network to LPL Financial LLC.
The initial consideration received was 252 million US$325 million resulting in a profit on disposal of 162 million US$209 million before tax and after costs and net losses that have been incurred in the year.
D2 Contingencies and related obligations Litigation and regulatory matters In addition to the matters set out in note C11 in relation to the Financial Conduct Authority review of past annuity sales, the Group is involved in various litigation and regulatory issues.
These may from time to time include class actions involving Jackson.
While the outcome of such litigation and regulatory issues cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that their ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Guarantees Guarantee funds in both the UK and the US provide for payments to be made to policyholders on behalf of insolvent life insurance companies and are financed by payments assessed on solvent insurance companies based on location, volume and types of business.
The estimated reserve for future guarantee fund assessments is not significant.
The directors believe that the reserve is adequate for all anticipated payments for known insolvencies.
The Group has provided other guarantees and commitments to thirdparties entered into in the normal course of business but the Group does not consider that the amounts involved are significant.
Support for with-profits sub-funds by shareholders funds PAC is liable to meet its obligations to withprofits policyholders even if the assets of the withprofits subfunds are insufficient to do so.
The assets, represented by the unallocated surplus of withprofits funds, in excess of amounts expected to be paid for future terminal bonuses and related shareholder transfers the excess assets in the withprofits subfunds could be materially depleted over time by, for example, a significant or sustained equity market downturn, costs of significant fundamental strategic change or a material increase in the pension misselling provision.
In the unlikely circumstance that the depletion of the excess assets within the longterm fund was such that the Groups ability to satisfy policyholders reasonable expectations was adversely affected, it might become necessary to restrict the annual distribution to shareholders or to contribute shareholders funds to the withprofits subfunds to provide financial support.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 283 D Other notes continued D2 Contingencies and related obligations continued Litigation and regulatory matters continued Matters relating to withprofits subfunds: Pension misselling review The UK insurance regulator required all UK life insurance companies to review sales of personal pensions policies for potential misselling.
Offers to all cases were made by 30 June 2002.
Costs arising from this review are met by the excess assets of the PAC withprofits subfund and hence have not been charged to the asset shares used in the determination of policyholder bonus rates.
Prudential has given an assurance that these deductions from excess assets will not impact its bonus or investment policy for policies within the withprofits subfunds that were in force at 31 December 2003.
This assurance does not apply to new business since 1 January 2004.
In the unlikely event that such deductions would affect the bonus or investment policy for the relevant policies, Prudential has stated it would make available support to the subfund from shareholder resources for as long as the situation continued, so as to ensure that policyholders were not disadvantaged.
Scottish Amicable Insurance subfund Policies within this subfund a withprofits subfund closed to new business contain minimum levels of guaranteed benefit to policyholders.
Should the assets of the subfund be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations of the policyholders of SAIF, the PAC withprofits subfund would be liable to cover any such deficiency in the first instance.
In addition, certain pensions products within this subfund have guaranteed annuity rates at retirement, for which a provision of 503 million was held within the subfund 2016: 571 million.
Guaranteed annuities A provision for guaranteed annuity products of 53 million was held 2016: 62 million in the PAC withprofits subfund.
Intra-group capital support arrangements Prudential and PAC have put in place intragroup arrangements to formalise circumstances in which capital support would be made available by Prudential.
While Prudential considers it unlikely that such support will be required, the arrangements are intended to provide additional comfort to PAC and its policyholders.
In addition, Prudential has put in place intragroup arrangements to formalise undertakings by Prudential to the regulators of the Hong Kong subsidiaries regarding their solvency levels.
D3 Post balance sheet events Dividends The second interim ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017, that was approved by the Board of Directors after 31 December 2017 is described in note B6.
Intention to demerge the Groups UK businesses In March 2018, the Group announced its intention to demerge its UK and Europe business M&G Prudential from Prudential plc, resulting in two separately listed companies.
In preparation for the UK demerger process, Prudential plc intends to transfer the legal ownership of its Hong Kong insurance subsidiaries from The Prudential Assurance Company Limited M&G Prudentials UK regulated insurance entity to Prudential Corporation Asia Limited, which is expected to complete by the end of 2019.
Sale of 12.0 billion UK annuity portfolio In March 2018, M&G Prudential also announced the sale of 12.0 billion of its shareholder annuity portfolio to Rothesay Life.
Under the terms of the agreement, M&G Prudential has reinsured 12.0 billion of liabilities to Rothesay Life, which is expected to be followed by a Part VII transfer of the portfolio by the end of 2019.
Further details are set out in the CFO Report.
Relates to 12.0 billion of IFRS shareholder annuity liabilities, valued as at 31 December 2017.

In addition, there are no material transactions between the Groups joint ventures which are accounted for on an equity method basis and other Group companies.
Executive officers and directors of the Company may from time to time purchase insurance, asset management or annuity products marketed by Group companies in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons.
In 2017 and 2016, other transactions with directors were not deemed to be significant both by virtue of their size and in the context of the directors financial positions.
All of these transactions are on terms broadly equivalent to those that prevail in arms length transactions.
Apart from these transactions with directors, no director had interests in shares, transactions or arrangements that require disclosure, other than those given in the Directors remuneration report.
Key management remuneration is disclosed in note B2.3.
D5 Commitments Operating leases and capital commitments The Group leases various offices to conduct its business.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.

At 31 December 2017, UK and Europes insurance operations had unfunded commitments of 3,225 million 2016: 2,269 million to private equity and infrastructure funds.
These commitments were entered into in the normal course of business and no material adverse impact on the operations is expected to arise.
D6 Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates a Dividend restrictions and minimum capital requirements Certain Group subsidiaries and joint ventures are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise to the parent company.
Under UK company law, UK companies can only declare dividends if they have sufficient distributable reserves.
Further, UK insurance companies are required to maintain solvency margins in accordance with the rules of the Prudential Regulation Authority.
M&G Prudentials asset management company, M&G Investment Management Limited, is also required to maintain capital in accordance with regulatory requirements before making any distribution to the parent company.
Jackson is subject to state laws that limit the dividends payable to its parent company based on statutory capital, surplus and prior year earnings.
Dividends in excess of these limitations require prior regulatory approval.
The Groups subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in Asia may remit dividends to the Group, in general, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital adequacy standard required under local statutory regulations and has sufficient distributable reserves.
For further details on local capital regulations in Asia please refer to note C12 b. www.

In addition, there is an asset management joint venture in Hong Kong with Bank of China International Holdings Limited BOCI and Takaful general and life insurance joint venture in Malaysia.
The Group has various joint ventures relating to property investments held by the PAC withprofits fund.
The results of these joint ventures are reflected in the movement in the unallocated surplus of the PAC withprofits funds and therefore do not affect shareholders results.
For the Groups joint ventures that are accounted for by using the equity method, the net of tax results of these operations are included in the Groups profit before tax.
The investments in these joint ventures have the same accounting year end as the Group.
The Groups associates, which are also accounted for under the equity method, include PPM South Africa and from September 2016 the Indian insurance entity, see below.
In addition, the Group has investments in OpenEnded Investment Companies OEICs, unit trusts, funds holding collateralised debt obligations, property unit trusts and venture capital investments of the PAC withprofits funds where the Group has significant influence.
As allowed under IAS 28, these investments are accounted for on a fair value through profit or loss basis.
The aggregate fair value of associates accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, where there are published price quotations, is approximately 2.4 billion at 31 December 2017 2016: 3.5 billion.
During 2016, following its listing and consequent amendments to the shareholder agreement, the Group ceased to exercise joint control over the insurance business in India, therefore the investment was reclassified as an associate, and continued to be accounted for using the equity method.
The Groups share of the profits including shortterm fluctuations in investment returns, net of related tax, and carrying amount of interest in joint ventures and associates, which are equity accounted as shown in the consolidated income statement comprises the following: Joint ventures and associates 2017 m 2016 m Shareholderbacked business 196 161 PAC withprofits fund prior to offsetting effect in movement in unallocated surplus 106 21 Total 302 182 UnalloAsia US UK and Europe cated to a segment Asset Asset Asset Total other Group Insurance management Insurance management Insurance management segment operations total 2017 Share of profits from joint ventures and associates, net of related tax 121 60 106 15 302 302 2016 Share of profits from joint ventures and associates, net of related tax 94 54 21 13 182 182 There is no other comprehensive income in the joint ventures and associates.

co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 297 E Further accounting policies E1 Other Significant accounting policies In addition to the critical accounting polices presented in note A3.1, the following detailed accounting policies are adopted by the Group to prepare the consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented and normally are not subject to change unless new accounting standards, interpretations or amendments are introduced by the IASB.
a Basis of consolidation The Group consolidates those investees it is deemed to control.
The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following are met: 1 it has power over an investee: 2 it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and 3 it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect its own returns.
i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those investees that the Group controls.
The majority of the Groups subsidiaries are corporate entities, but the Groups insurance operations also invest in a number of limited partnerships.
The Group performs a reassessment of consolidation whenever there is a change in the substance of the relationship between the Group and an investee.
Where the Group is deemed to control an entity it is treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities are consolidated.
Where the Group holds a minority share in an entity, with no control over the entity, the investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Entities consolidated by the Group include Qualifying Partnerships as defined under the UK Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 the Partnerships Act.
Some of these limited partnerships have taken advantage of the exemption under regulation 7 of the Partnerships Act from the financial statements requirements.
This is under regulations 4 to 6, on the basis that these limited partnerships are dealt with on a consolidated basis in these financial statements.
ii Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are joint arrangements arising from a contractual agreement whereby the Group and other investors have joint control of the net assets of the arrangement.
In a number of these arrangements, the Groups share of the underlying net assets may be less than 50 per cent but the terms of the relevant agreement make it clear that control is jointly exercised between the Group and the third party.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but it does not control.
Generally it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it holds between 20 per cent and 50 per cent voting rights of the entity.
With the exception of those referred to below, the Group accounts for its investments in joint ventures and associates by using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of profit or loss of its joint ventures and associates is recognised in the income statement and its share of movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The equity method of accounting does not apply to investments in associates and joint ventures held by the Groups insurance or investment funds.
This includes venture capital business, mutual funds and unit trusts and which, as allowed by IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, are carried at fair value through profit or loss.
iii Structured entities Structured entities are those that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity.
Voting rights relate to administrative tasks.
Relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Group invests in structured entities such as: OpenEnded Investment Companies OEICs : Unit Trusts UTs : Limited partnerships: Variable interest entities: Investment vehicles within separate accounts offered through variable annuities: Collateralised debt obligations: Mortgagebacked securities: and Similar assetbacked securities.
Open-ended investment companies and unit trusts The Group invests in OEICs and UTs, which invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties.
The Groups percentage ownership in these entities can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the Group and other investors in them.
Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Groups ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50 per cent, the Group is judged to have control over the entity.
Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Groups ownership holding in the entity is between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, the facts and circumstances of the Groups involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager from the entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity.
Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Groups ownership holding in the entity is less than 20 per cent, the Group is judged to not have control over the entity.
Where the entity is managed by an asset manager outside the Group, an assessment is made of whether the Group has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the current activities of the entity and therefore control the entity.
In assessing the Groups ability to direct an entity, the Group considers its ability relative to other investors.
The Group has a limited number of OEICs and UTs where it considers it has such ability.
298 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Where the Group is deemed to control these entities, they are treated as a subsidiary and are consolidated, with the interests of investors other than the Group being classified as liabilities, and appear as net asset value attributable to unit holders of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
Where the Group does not control these entities as it is deemed to be acting as an agent and they do not meet the definition of associates, they are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Where the Groups asset manager sets up OEICs and UTs as part of asset management operations, the Groups interest is limited to the administration fees charged to manage the assets of such entities.
With no participation in these entities, the Group does not retain risks associated with OEICs and UTs.
For these openended investment companies and unit trusts, the Group is not deemed to control the entities but to be acting as an agent.
The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in investment vehicles commensurate to its participation and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks of these investment vehicles.
Jacksons separate account assets These are investment vehicles that invest contract holders premiums in equity, fixed income, bonds and money market mutual funds.
The contract holder retains the underlying returns and the ownership risks related to the underlying investments.
The shareholders economic interest in separate accounts is limited to the administrative fees charged.
The separate accounts are set up as separate regulated entities governed by a Board of Governors or trustees for which the majority of the members are independent of Jackson or any affiliated entity.
The independent members are responsible for any decision making that impacts contract holders interest and govern the operational activities of the entities advisers, including asset managers.
Accordingly, the Group does not control these vehicles.
These investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Limited partnerships The Groups insurance operations invest in a number of limited partnerships, either directly or through unit trusts, through a mix of capital and loans.
These limited partnerships are managed by general partners, in which the Group holds equity.
Such interest in general partners and limited partnerships provide the Group with voting and similar rights to participate in the governance framework of the relevant activities in which limited partnerships are engaged in.
Accounting for the limited partnerships as subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on the terms of each partnership agreement and the shareholdings in the general partners.
Other structured entities The Group holds investments in mortgagebacked securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar assetbacked securities, the majority of which are actively traded in a liquid market.
The Group consolidates the vehicles that hold the investments where the Group is deemed to control the vehicles.
When assessing control over the vehicles, the factors considered include the purpose and design of the vehicle, the Groups exposure to the variability of returns and the scope of the Groups ability to direct the relevant activities of the vehicle including any kickout or removal rights that are held by third parties.
The outcome of the control assessment is dependent on the terms and conditions of the respective individual arrangements.
The majority of such vehicles are not consolidated.
In these cases the Group is not the sponsor of the vehicles in which it holds investments and has no administrative rights over the vehicles activities.
The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks commensurate to its holding and its exposure to the investments.
Accordingly the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of such vehicles and all are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.

co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 299 E Further accounting policies continued E1 Other continued Significant accounting policies continued b Reinsurance The measurement of reinsurance assets is consistent with the measurement of the underlying direct insurance contracts.
The treatment of any gains or losses arising on the purchase of reinsurance contracts is dependent on the underlying accounting basis of the entity concerned.
c Earned premiums, policy fees and claims paid Premiums for conventional withprofits policies and other protection type insurance policies are recognised as revenue when due.
Premiums and annuity considerations for linked policies, unitised withprofits and other investment type policies are recognised as revenue when received or, in the case of unitised or unitlinked policies, when units are issued.
These amounts exclude premium taxes and similar duties where Prudential collects and settles taxes borne by the customer.
Policy fees charged on linked and unitised withprofits policies for mortality, asset management and policy administration are recognised as revenue when related services are provided.
Claims paid include maturities, annuities, surrenders and deaths.
Maturity claims are recorded as charges on the policy maturity date.
Annuity claims are recorded when each annuity instalment becomes due for payment.
Surrenders are charged to the income statement when paid and death claims are recorded when notified.
d Investment return Investment return included in the income statement principally comprises interest income, dividends, investment appreciation depreciation realised and unrealised gains and losses on investments designated as fair value through profit or loss, and realised gains and losses including impairment losses on items held at amortised cost and Jacksons debt securities designated as availableforsale.
Movements in unrealised appreciation depreciation of Jacksons debt securities designated as availableforsale are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on investments.
Dividends on equity securities are recognised on the exdividend date and rental income is recognised on an accrual basis.
e Financial investments other than instruments classified as long-term business contracts i Investment classification The Group holds financial investments in accordance with IAS 39, whereby subject to specific criteria, financial instruments are required to be accounted for under one of the following categories: Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss this comprises assets and liabilities designated by management as fair value through profit or loss on inception and derivatives that are held for trading.
These investments are measured at fair value with all changes thereon being recognised in investment return in the income statement: Financial investments on an availableforsale basis this comprises assets that are designated by management as availableforsale and or do not fall into any of the other categories.
These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs.
Availableforsale assets are subsequently measured at fair value.
Interest income is recognised on an effective interest basis in the income statement.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Except for foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities, which are included in the income statement, unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Upon disposal or impairment, accumulated unrealised gains and losses are transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement as realised gains or losses: and Loans and receivables except for those designated as at fair value through profit or loss or availableforsale, these instruments comprise nonquoted investments that have fixed or determinable payments.
These instruments include loans collateralised by mortgages, deposits, loans to policyholders and other unsecured loans and receivables.
These investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Subsequently, these instruments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group uses the trade date method to account for regular purchases and sales of financial assets.
See note A3.1 for further details of valuation of financial investments.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults ii Derivatives and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage investment, interest rate and currency exposures, to facilitate efficient portfolio management and for investment purposes.
The Group may designate certain derivatives as hedges.
For hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of any change in fair value of derivatives or other financial instruments designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in the income statement.
The Group does not regularly seek to apply fair value or cash flow hedging treatment under IAS 39.
The Group has no fair value and cash flows hedges under IAS 39 at 31 December 2017 and 2016.
All derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are carried at fair value, with movements in fair value being recorded in the income statement.
The primary areas of the Groups continuing operations where derivative instruments are held are the UK withprofits funds and annuity business, and Jackson.
For UK withprofits funds the derivative programme is used for the purposes of efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risk.
For shareholderbacked UK annuity business the derivatives are held to contribute to the matching as far as practical, of asset returns and duration with those of liabilities to policyholders.
The carrying value of these liabilities is sensitive to the return on the matching financial assets including derivatives held.
For Jacksons derivative programme see note A3.1.
iii Embedded derivatives Embedded derivatives are present in host contracts issued by various Group companies, in particular Jackson.
They are embedded within other nonderivative host financial instruments and insurance contracts to create hybrid instruments.
Embedded derivatives meeting the definition of an insurance contract are accounted for under IFRS 4.
Where economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host instrument, and where the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and carried at fair value as a derivative measured in accordance with IAS 39.
In addition, the Group applies the option under IFRS 4 to not separate and fair value surrender options embedded in host contracts and withprofits investment contracts whose strike price is either a fixed amount or a fixed amount plus interest.
iv Securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements The Group is party to various securities lending agreements including repurchase agreements under which securities are loaned to third parties on a shortterm basis.
The loaned securities are not derecognised: rather, they continue to be recognised within the appropriate investment classification.
The Groups policy is that collateral in excess of 100 per cent of the fair value of securities loaned is required from all securities borrowers and typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities or letters of credit.
In cases where the Group takes possession of the collateral under its securities lending programme, the collateral, and corresponding obligation to return such collateral, are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group is also party to various reverse repurchase agreements under which securities are purchased from third parties with an obligation to resell the securities.
The securities are not recognised as investments in the statement of financial position.
v Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
vi Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss Consistent with the Groups risk management and investment strategy and the nature of the products concerned, the Group has designated under IAS 39 classification certain financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as these instruments are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis.
These instruments include liabilities related to consolidated collateralised debt obligations and net assets attributable to unit holders of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 301 E Further accounting policies continued E1 Other continued Significant accounting policies continued f Segments Under IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is internally provided to the Group Executive Committee which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The operating segments identified by the Group reflect the Groups organisational structure, which, following a reorganisation during the year, is by business units Asia, US and UK and Europe.
All business units contain both insurance and asset management operations.
Further information on the Groups operating segments is provided in note B1.3.
g Borrowings Although initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, borrowings, excluding liabilities of consolidated collateralised debt obligations, are subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds net of related issue costs is amortised through the income statement to the date of maturity or for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
h Investment properties Investments in leasehold and freehold properties not for occupation by the Group, including properties under development for future use as investment properties, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
Properties are valued annually either by the Groups qualified surveyors or by taking into consideration the advice of professional external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards.
Each property is externally valued at least once every three years.
Leases of investment property where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases leasehold property.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
i Pension schemes For the Groups defined benefit schemes, if the present value of the defined benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the scheme assets, then a liability is recorded in the Groups statement of financial position.
By contrast, if the fair value of the assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation then the surplus will only be recognised if the nature of the arrangements under the trust deed, and funding arrangements between the Trustee and the Company, support the availability of refunds or recoverability through agreed reductions in future contributions.
In addition, if there is a constructive obligation for the Company to pay deficit funding, this is also recognised such that the financial position recorded for the scheme reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 deficit and the obligation for deficit funding.
The Group utilises the projected unit credit method to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
This method sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a highquality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The plan assets of the Groups pension schemes include several insurance contracts that have been issued by the Group.
These assets are excluded from plan assets in determining the pension surplus or deficit recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel, and the net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset at the start of the period, is charged to the income statement.
Actuarial and other gains and losses as a result of changes in assumptions or experience variances are recognised as other comprehensive income.
Contributions to the Groups defined contribution schemes are expensed when due.
j Share-based payments and related movements in own shares The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
Shares held in trust relating to these plans are conditionally gifted to employees.
The compensation expense charged to the income statement is primarily based upon the fair value of the options granted, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.
The Company has established trusts to facilitate the delivery of Prudential plc shares under employee incentive plans and savings related share option schemes.
The cost to the Company of acquiring these treasury shares held in trusts is shown as a deduction from shareholders equity.
302 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults k Tax Prudential is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the total tax charge inherently involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
Current tax expense is charged or credited based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year and adjustments made in relation to prior years.
The positions taken in tax returns where applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation are recognised in full in the determination of the tax charge in the financial statements if the Group considers that it is probable that the taxation authority will accept those positions.
Otherwise, provisions are established based on managements estimate and judgement of the likely amount of the liability, or recovery, by providing for the single best estimate of the most likely outcome or the weighted average expected value where there are multiple outcomes.
The total tax charge includes tax expense attributable to both policyholders and shareholders.
The tax expense attributable to policyholders comprises the tax on the income of the consolidated withprofits and unitlinked funds.
In certain jurisdictions, such as the UK, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders profits and on their policyholders insurance and investment returns on certain insurance and investment products.
Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in the Groups consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the consolidated income statement to provide the most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits.
Deferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences.
IAS 12 Income Taxes does not require all temporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
l Business acquisitions and disposals Business acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting, which adjusts the net assets of the acquired company to fair value at the date of purchase.
The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill.
Expenses related to acquiring new subsidiaries are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Income and expenses of acquired entities are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Income and expenses of entities sold during the period are included in the income statement up to the date of disposal.
The gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between sale proceeds net of selling costs, less the net assets of the entity at the date of disposal, adjusted for foreign exchange movements attaching to the sold entity that are required to be recycled to the income statement under IAS 21. m Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses is capitalised and carried on the Group statement of financial position as an intangible asset at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill impairment testing is conducted annually and when there is an indication of impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units.
For further details see note C5 a. n Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired on the purchase of a subsidiary or portfolio of contracts are measured at fair value on acquisition.
Deferred acquisition costs are accounted for as described in note A3.1 c. Other intangible assets, such as distribution rights and software, are valued initially at the price paid to acquire them and are subsequently carried at cost less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Distribution rights relate to fees paid under bancassurance partnership arrangements for bank distribution of products for the term of the contract.
Amounts for distribution rights are amortised on a basis to reflect the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by reference to new business production levels.
The same principles apply to determining the amortisation method for other intangible assets unless the pattern cannot be determined reliably, in which case a straight line method is applied.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the acquisition costs and other expenditure line in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment testing is conducted when there is an indication of impairment.
o Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other shortterm highly liquid investments with less than 90 days maturity from the date of acquisition.
p Shareholders dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 303 E Further accounting policies continued E1 Other continued Significant accounting policies continued q Share capital Shares are classified as equity when their terms do not create an obligation to transfer assets.
The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares, net of share issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued, is credited to share premium.
Where the Company purchases shares for the purposes of employee incentive plans, the consideration paid, net of issue costs, is deducted from retained earnings.
Upon issue or sale any consideration received is credited to retained earnings net of related costs.
r Foreign exchange The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the Groups presentation currency.
Accordingly, the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries must be translated into the presentation currency of the Group from their functional currencies, ie the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are converted at year end exchange rates while all income and expenses are converted at average exchange rates where this is a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing on transaction dates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded as a separate component in the statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency borrowings that are used to provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates and movements recognised in other comprehensive income.
Other foreign currency monetary items are translated at year end exchange rates with changes recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency transactions are translated at the spot rate prevailing at the time.
s Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in employee share trusts and consolidated unit trusts and OEICs, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Groups only class of potentially dilutive ordinary shares are those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
No adjustment is made if the impact is antidilutive overall.

The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with operations in Asia, the US, UK and Europe and Africa.
In Asia, the Group has operations in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and other markets.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
In UK and Europe, the Group operates through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited and M&G Investment Management Limited.
In August 2017 the Company announced that it was bringing together M&G with Prudentials UK and European savings and retirement business to form M&G Prudential.
2 Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the statement of financial position, statement of changes in equity and related notes, are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and endorsed by the EU, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: A cash flow statement and related notes: Disclosures in respect of transactions with whollyowned subsidiaries within the Prudential Group: Disclosure in respect of capital management: and The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
As the consolidated financial statements of the Group include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Groupsettled sharebased payments: and Disclosure required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
In 2017, the Company adopted Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes recognition of deferred tax assets and Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20142016 Cycle.
Their adoption had no material impact on the financial statements of the Company.
The accounting policies set out in note 3 below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
3 Significant accounting policies Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less impairment.
Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are held to manage certain macroeconomic exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity or, for subordinated debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 307 Notes on the parent company financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Foreign currency translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, are translated at year end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12, Income Taxes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups main pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
The Company applies the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefit as revised in 2011 for the accounting of its interest in the PSPS surplus or deficit.
Further details are disclosed in note 7.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The Companys share of pension surplus is recognised to the extent that the Company is able to recover a surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond yield, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities, where appropriate, to determine their present value.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the net income interest on the net scheme assets liabilities at the start of the period, is recognised in the profit or loss account.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, experience variances or the return on scheme assets excluding amounts included in the net deferred benefit asset liability are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Share-based payments The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The sharebased payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equitysettled plans with a few cashsettled plans.
Under IFRS 2 Sharebased payment, where the Company, as the parent company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such sharebased payments are accounted for as equity settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.

The retained profit includes distributable reserves of 3,066 million and nondistributable reserves of 2,486 million.
The nondistributable reserves comprise 2,405 million relating to gains made by intermediate holding companies following the transfer at fair value of certain subsidiaries to other parts of the Group as part of internal restructuring exercises in previous years and 81 million of sharebased payment reserves.
The amount of 2,405 million is not able to be regarded as part of the distributable reserves of the parent company because the gains relate to intragroup transactions.
Under English company law, Prudential may pay dividends only if sufficient distributable reserves of the Company are available for the purpose and if the amount of its net assets is greater than the aggregate of its called up share capital and nondistributable reserves such as the share premium account and the payment of the dividend does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that aggregate.
The retained profit of the Company is substantially generated from dividend income received from subsidiaries.
The Group segmental analysis illustrates the generation of profit across the Group see note B1 of the Group financial statements.
The Group and its subsidiaries are subject to local regulatory minimum capital requirements, as set out in note C12 of the Group financial statements.
A number of the principal risks set out in the Report on the risks facing our business and how these are managed could impact the generation of profit in the Groups subsidiaries in the future and hence impact their ability to pay dividends in the future.
In determining the dividend payment in any year the directors follow the Group dividend policy described in the Chief Financial Officers report section of this Annual Report.
The directors consider the Companys ability to pay current and future dividends twice a year by reference to the Companys business plan and certain stressed scenarios.
12 Other information a Information on directors remuneration is given in the directors remuneration report section of this Annual Report and note B2.3 of the Group financial statements.
b Information on transactions of the directors with the Group is given in note D4 of the Group financial statements.

By contrast, EEV is a way of reporting the value of the life insurance business.
The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the EEV Principles dated April 2016, issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum.
The EEV Principles provide consistent definitions, a framework for setting actuarial assumptions, and an approach to the underlying methodology and disclosures.
Results prepared under the EEV Principles capture the discounted value of future profits expected to arise from the current book of longterm business.
The results are prepared by projecting cash flows, by product, using best estimate assumptions for all relevant factors.
Furthermore, in determining these expected profits, full allowance is made for the risks attached to their emergence and the associated cost of capital, taking into account recent experience in assessing likely future persistency, mortality, morbidity and expenses.
Further details are explained in notes 14 and 15.

b This item reflects the net impact of: c hanges in projected future fees and future benefit costs arising from the difference between the actual growth in separate account asset values of 17.5 per cent and that assumed of 5.9 per cent for the year 2016: actual growth of 8.9 per cent compared to assumed growth of 6.0 per cent : and related hedging activity arising from realised and unrealised gains and losses on equityrelated hedges and interest rate options, and other items.

In addition, various changes to the basis of setting economic assumptions were made with an overall impact of 5 million see note 14 a viii, note 15 i and note 15 iv.

For fixed annuity and other general account business, the impact reflects the effect on the present value of future projected spread income from the combined movement in interest rates and credit spreads.

336 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults 7 Impact of US tax reform On 22 December 2017, a significant US tax reform package, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted into law effective from 1 January 2018.
The tax reform package as a whole, which includes a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, and a number of specific measures affecting US life insurers, results in a 390 million benefit in nonoperating profit.
The positive impact on an EEV basis represents the benefit of future profits being taxed at a lower rate, partially offset by a reduction in the net deferred tax asset held in the balance sheet to reflect remeasurement at the new lower tax rate, together with a reduction in the benefit from the dividend received deduction on taxable profits from variable annuity business.
In accordance with our usual methodology, the new business contribution and unwind of discount and other expected returns are determined by applying operating and economic assumptions as at the end of the year, including the effect of US tax reform.
This led to an increase in new business profit of 76 million.

Where appropriate, adjustments are made to the net worth so that backing assets are included at fair value rather than cost so as to comply with the EEV Principles.
In Asia and US operations, assets deemed to be inadmissible on local regulatory basis are included in net worth where considered fully recognisable on an EEV basis.
Free surplus for asset management operations and the UK general insurance commission is taken to be IFRS basis posttax earnings and shareholders equity, net of goodwill.
Free surplus for other operations including Group and Asia Regional Head Office, holding company borrowings, Africa operations and Prudential Capital is taken to be EEV basis posttax earnings and shareholders equity net of goodwill, with subordinated debt recorded as free surplus to the extent that it is classified as available capital under Solvency II.

In particular, other items include the deduction of the shareholders interest in the withprofits estate, the value of which is derived by increasing final bonus rates so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the inforce withprofits business.
This is an assumption to give an appropriate valuation.
To be conservative this item is excluded from the expected free surplus generation profile below.
Cash flows are projected on a deterministic basis and are discounted at the appropriate risk discount rate.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups EEV reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.

If the change in assumptions shown in the sensitivities were to occur, then the effect shown above would be recorded within two components of the profit analysis for the following year, namely the effect of economic assumption changes and shortterm fluctuations in investment returns.
In addition to the sensitivity effects shown above, the other components of the profit for the following year would be calculated by reference to the altered assumptions, for example new business contribution and unwind of discount, together with the effect of other changes such as altered corporate bond spreads.
In addition, for changes in interest rates, the effect shown above for Jackson would also be recorded within the fair value movements on assets backing surplus and required capital, which are taken directly to shareholders equity.

The shareholders interest in the Groups longterm business comprises: The present value of future shareholder cash flows from inforce covered business value of inforce business, less deductions for: The cost of lockedin required capital: and The time value of cost of options and guarantees: Lockedin required capital: and The shareholders net worth in excess of required capital free surplus.
The value of future new business is excluded from the embedded value.
Notwithstanding the basis of presentation of results as explained in note 14 b iii, no smoothing of market or account balance values, unrealised gains or investment return is applied in determining the embedded value or profit.
Separately, the analysis of profit is delineated between operating profit based on longerterm investment returns and other constituent items, as explained in note 14 b i. i Covered business The EEV results for the Group are prepared for covered business, as defined by the EEV Principles.
Covered business represents the Groups longterm insurance business, including the Groups investments in joint venture and associate insurance operations, for which the value of new and inforce contracts is attributable to shareholders.
The posttax EEV basis results for the Groups covered business are then combined with the posttax IFRS basis results of the Groups asset management and other operations including Group and Asia Regional Head Office, holding company borrowings, Africa operations and Prudential Capital.
Under the EEV Principles, the results for covered business incorporate the projected margins of attaching internal asset management, as described in note 14 a vii.
The definition of longterm business operations comprises those contracts falling under the definition for regulatory purposes together with, for US operations, contracts that are in substance the same as guaranteed investment contracts GICs but do not fall within the technical definition.
Covered business comprises the Groups longterm business operations, with two exceptions: The closed Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF which is excluded from covered business.
SAIF is a ringfenced subfund of The Prudential Assurance Company Limited PAC longterm fund, established by a Court Approved Scheme of Arrangement in October 1997.
SAIF is closed to new business and the assets and liabilities of the fund are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
The presentational treatment of the Groups principal defined benefit pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
The partial recognition of the surplus for PSPS is recognised in Other operations.
A small amount of UK group pensions business is also not modelled for EEV reporting purposes.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 347 Notes on the EEV basis results continued 14 Methodology and accounting presentation continued a Methodology continued ii Valuation of in-force and new business The embedded value results are prepared incorporating best estimate assumptions about all relevant factors including levels of future investment returns, expenses, persistency, mortality and morbidity, as described in note 15 vii.
These assumptions are used to project future cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows is then calculated using a discount rate which reflects both the time value of money and the nondiversifiable risks associated with the cash flows that are not otherwise allowed for.
New business In determining the EEV basis value of new business, premiums are included in projected cash flows on the same basis of distinguishing annual and single premium business as set out for statutory basis reporting.
New business premiums reflect those premiums attaching to covered business, including premiums for contracts classified as investment products for IFRS basis reporting.
New business premiums for regular premium products are shown on an annualised basis.
Internal vesting business is classified as new business where the contracts include an open market option.
The posttax contribution from new business represents profits determined by applying operating and economic assumptions as at the end of the year.
New business profitability is a key metric for the Groups management of the development of the business.
In addition, posttax new business margins are shown by reference to annual premium equivalents APE and the present value of new business premiums PVNBP.
These margins are calculated as the percentage of the value of new business profit to APE and PVNBP.
APE is calculated as the aggregate of regular premiums and onetenth of single premiums.
PVNBP is calculated as equalling single premiums plus the present value of expected premiums of regular premium new business, allowing for lapses and other assumptions made in determining the EEV new business contribution.
Valuation movements on investments With the exception of debt securities held by Jackson, investment gains and losses during the year to the extent that changes in capital values do not directly match changes in liabilities are included directly in the profit for the year and shareholders equity as they arise.
The results for any covered business conceptually reflect the aggregate of the IFRS results and the movements on the additional shareholders interest recognised on the EEV basis.
Thus the start point for the calculation of the EEV results for Jackson, as for other businesses, reflects the market value movements recognised on an IFRS basis.
However, in determining the movements on the additional shareholders interest, the basis for calculating the EEV result for Jackson acknowledges that, for debt securities backing liabilities, the aggregate EEV results reflect the fact that the value of inforce business instead incorporates the discounted value of future spread earnings.
This value is not affected generally by shortterm market movements on securities that, broadly speaking, are held for the longer term.
Fixed income securities backing the free surplus and required capital for Jackson are accounted for at fair value.
However, consistent with the treatment applied under IFRS for Jackson securities classified as availableforsale, movements in unrealised appreciation depreciation on these securities are accounted for in equity rather than in the income statement, as shown in the movement in shareholders equity.
iii Cost of capital A charge is deducted from the embedded value for the cost of lockedin required capital supporting the Groups longterm business.
The cost is the difference between the nominal value of the capital and the discounted value of the projected releases of this capital, allowing for posttax investment earnings on the capital.
The annual result is affected by the movement in this cost from year to year which comprises a charge against new business profit and generally a release in respect of the reduction in capital requirements for business in force as this runs off.
Where required, capital is held within a withprofits longterm fund, the value placed on surplus assets in the fund is already discounted to reflect its release over time and no further adjustment is necessary in respect of required capital.
iv Financial options and guarantees Nature of financial options and guarantees in Prudentials long-term business Asia Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described below in respect of UK and Europe business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts which are principally written in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.
Participating products have both guaranteed and nonguaranteed elements.
There are also various nonparticipating longterm products with guarantees.
The principal guarantees are those for wholeoflife contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions.
US Jackson The principal financial options and guarantees in Jackson are associated with the fixed annuity FA and variable annuity VA lines of business.
Fixed annuities provide that, at Jacksons discretion, it may reset the interest rate credited to policyholders accounts, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
The guaranteed minimum return varies from 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent for both years, depending on the particular product, jurisdiction where issued, and date of issue.
For both years, 87 per cent of the account values on fixed annuities are for policies with guarantees of 3 per cent or less, and the average guarantee rate is 2.6 per cent.
348 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults Fixed annuities also present a risk that policyholders will exercise their option to surrender their contracts in periods of rapidly rising interest rates, possibly requiring Jackson to liquidate assets at an inopportune time.
Jackson issues VA contracts for which it contractually guarantees to the contract holder, subject to specific conditions, either: a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals: b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return: or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the specified contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable upon depletion of funds Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit GMWB, as death benefits Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits GMDB or as income benefits Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits GMIB.
These guarantees generally protect the policyholders value in the event of poor equity market performance.
Jackson hedges the GMWB and GMDB guarantees through the use of equity options and futures contracts, and essentially fully reinsures the GMIB guarantees.
Jackson also issues fixed index annuities FIA that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equitylinked return while providing a guaranteed minimum return.
The guaranteed minimum returns are of a similar nature to those described above for fixed annuities.
UK and Europe M&G Prudential For covered business the only significant financial options and guarantees in M&G Prudential arise in the withprofits fund.
Withprofits products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed.
There are two types of bonuses: annual and final.
Annual bonuses are declared once a year and, once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
Unlike annual bonuses, final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.
The PAC withprofits fund also held a provision of 53 million at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: 62 million to honour guarantees on a small number of guaranteed annuity option products.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuity options in M&G Prudential is through the noncovered business of SAIF.
A provision of 503 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: 571 million to honour the guarantees.
As described in note 14 a i, the assets and liabilities are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
Therefore the movement in the provision has no direct impact on shareholders funds.
Time value The value of financial options and guarantees comprises two parts: The first part arises from a deterministic valuation on best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value.
The second part arises from the variability of economic outcomes in the future the time value.
Where appropriate, a full stochastic valuation has been undertaken to determine the time value of the financial options and guarantees.
The economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations.
Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of longterm economic conditions.
Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, for example, separate modelling of individual asset classes but with an allowance for correlation between the various asset classes.
Details of the key characteristics of each model are given in notes 15 iv, v and vi.
In deriving the time value of financial options and guarantees, management actions in response to emerging investment and fund solvency conditions have been modelled.
Management actions encompass, but are not confined to, investment allocation decisions, levels of reversionary and terminal bonuses and credited rates.
Bonus rates are projected from current levels and varied in accordance with assumed management actions applying in the emerging investment and fund solvency conditions.
In all instances, the modelled actions are in accordance with approved local practice and therefore reflect the options actually available to management.
For the PAC withprofits fund, the actions assumed are consistent with those set out in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management which explains how regular and final bonus rates within the discretionary framework are determined, subject to the general legislative requirements applicable.
v Level of required capital In adopting the EEV Principles, Prudential has based required capital on its internal targets, subject to it being at least the local statutory minimum requirements.
For withprofits business written in a segregated life fund, as is the case in Asia and the UK, the capital available in the fund is sufficient to meet the required capital requirements.
For M&G Prudential, a portion of future shareholder transfers expected from the withprofits fund is recognised within net worth, together with the associated capital requirements.
For shareholderbacked business, the following capital requirements for longterm business operations apply: Asia: the level of required capital has been set to an amount at least equal to the higher of local statutory requirements and the internal target.
For China operations, the level of required capital as at 31 December 2017 follows the approach for embedded value reporting issued by the China Association of Actuaries CAA, reflecting the CROSS regime: US: the level of required capital has been set at 250 per cent of the riskbased capital RBC required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC at the Company Action Level CAL : and UK and Europe: the capital requirements are set at the Solvency II Solvency Capital Requirement SCR for shareholderbacked business as a whole.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 349 Notes on the EEV basis results continued 14 Methodology and accounting presentation continued a Methodology continued vi With-profits business and the treatment of the estate The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the PAC withprofits fund has been based on the present level of 10 per cent.
The value attributed to the shareholders interest in the estate is derived by increasing final bonus rates and related shareholder transfers so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the inforce withprofits business.
In any scenarios where the total assets of the life fund are insufficient to meet policyholder claims in full, the excess cost is fully attributed to shareholders.
Similar principles apply, where appropriate, for other withprofits funds of the Groups Asia operations.
vii Internal asset management The inforce and new business results from longterm business include the projected value of profits or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered insurance businesses.
The results of the Groups asset management operations include the current year profits from the management of both internal and external funds.
EEV basis shareholders other income and expenditure is adjusted to deduct the unwind of the expected internal asset management profit margin for the year as included in Other operations.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered insurance business.
Group operating profit accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profit in respect of management of the assets for covered business.
viii Allowance for risk and risk discount rates Overview Under the EEV Principles, discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows are set by reference to riskfree rates plus a risk margin.
For Asia and the US, the riskfree rates are based on 10year local government bond yields.
For UK and Europe, the EEV riskfree rate is based on the full term structure of interest rates, ie a yield curve, which is used to determine the embedded value at the end of the reporting period.
The risk margin should reflect any nondiversifiable risk associated with the emergence of distributable earnings that is not allowed for elsewhere in the valuation.
In order to better reflect differences in relative market risk volatility inherent in each product group, Prudential sets the risk discount rates to reflect the expected volatility associated with the cash flows for each product category in the embedded value model, rather than at a Group level.
Since financial options and guarantees are explicitly valued under the EEV methodology, risk discount rates under EEV are set excluding the effect of these product features.
The risk margin represents the aggregate of the allowance for market risk, additional allowance for credit risk where appropriate, and allowance for nondiversifiable nonmarket risk.
No allowance is required for nonmarket risks where these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.
Market risk allowance The allowance for market risk represents the beta multiplied by an equity risk premium.
Except for UK shareholderbacked annuity business as explained below, such an approach has been used for the Groups businesses.
The beta of a portfolio or product measures its relative market risk.
The risk discount rates reflect the market risk inherent in each product group and hence the volatility of product cash flows.
These are determined by considering how the profits from each product are affected by changes in expected returns on various asset classes.
By converting this into a relative rate of return, it is possible to derive a productspecific beta.
Product level betas reflect the most recent product mix to produce appropriate betas and risk discount rates for each major product grouping.
Additional credit risk allowance The Groups methodology is to allow appropriately for credit risk.
The allowance for total credit risk is to cover: Expected longterm defaults: Credit risk premium to reflect the volatility in downgrade and default levels : and Shortterm downgrades and defaults.
These allowances are initially reflected in determining best estimate returns and through the market risk allowance described above.
However, for those businesses largely backed by holdings of debt securities these allowances in the projected returns and market risk allowances may not be sufficient and an additional allowance may be appropriate.
The practical application of the allowance for credit risk varies depending upon the type of business as described below: Asia For Asia, the allowance for credit risk incorporated in the projected rates of return and the market risk allowance are sufficient.
Accordingly, no additional allowance for credit risk is required.
The projected rates of return for holdings of corporate bonds comprise the riskfree rate plus an assessment of longterm spread over the riskfree rate.
350 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults US Jackson For Jackson business, the allowance for longterm defaults is reflected in the risk margin reserve RMR charge which is deducted in determining the projected spread margin between the earned rate on the investments and the policyholder crediting rate.
The risk discount rate incorporates an additional allowance for credit risk premium and shortterm downgrades and defaults 0.2 per cent for variable annuity business and 1.0 per cent for nonvariable annuity business for both years, as shown in note 15 ii.
In determining this allowance a number of factors have been considered.
These factors, in particular, include: How much of the credit spread on debt securities represents an increased shortterm credit risk not reflected in the RMR longterm default assumptions, and how much is liquidity premium which is the premium required by investors to compensate for the risk of longerterm investments which cannot be easily converted into cash, and converted at the fair market value.
In assessing this effect, consideration has been given to a number of approaches to estimating the liquidity premium by considering recent statistical data: and Policyholder benefits for Jackson fixed annuity business are not fixed.
It is possible in adverse economic scenarios to pass on a component of credit losses to policyholders subject to guarantee features through lower investment returns credited to policyholders.
Consequently, it is only necessary to allow for the balance of the credit risk in the risk discount rate.
The level of the additional allowance is assessed at each reporting period to take account of prevailing credit conditions and as the business in force alters over time.
The additional allowance for variable annuity business has been set at onefifth of the nonvariable annuity business to reflect the proportion of the allocated holdings of general account debt securities.
The level of allowance differs from that for UK annuity business for investment portfolio differences and to take account of the management actions available in adverse economic scenarios to reduce crediting rates to policyholders, subject to guarantee features of the products.
UK and Europe M&G Prudential 1 Shareholder-backed annuity business For shareholderbacked annuity business, Prudential has used a market consistent embedded value MCEV approach to derive an implied risk discount rate which is then applied to the projected best estimate cash flows.
In the annuity MCEV calculations, as the assets are generally held to maturity to match liabilities, the future cash flows are discounted using the swap yield curve plus an allowance for liquidity premium based on the Solvency II allowance for credit risk.
The Solvency II allowance is set by European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority EIOPA using a prudent assumption that all future downgrades will be replaced annually, and allowing for the credit spread floor.
For the purposes of presentation in the EEV results, the results on this basis are reconfigured.
Under this approach the projected earned rate of return on the debt securities held is determined after allowing for a best estimate credit risk allowance.
The remaining elements of prudence within the Solvency II allowance are incorporated into the risk margin included in the discount rate, shown in note 15 iii.
2 With-profits fund non-profit annuity business For nonprofit annuity business attributable to the PAC withprofits fund, the basis for determining the aggregate allowance for credit risk is consistent with that applied for UK shareholderbacked annuity business as described above.
The allowance for credit risk for this business is taken into account in determining the projected cash flows from the withprofits fund, which are in turn discounted at the risk discount rate applicable to all of the projected cash flows from the fund.
3 With-profits fund holdings of debt securities The withprofits fund holds debt securities as part of its investment portfolio backing policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus.
The assumed earned rate for withprofit holdings of corporate bonds is defined as the riskfree rate plus an assessment of the longterm spread over risk free, net of expected longterm defaults.
This approach is similar to that applied for equities and properties for which the projected earned rate is defined as the riskfree rate plus a longterm risk premium.
Allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risks The majority of nonmarket and noncredit risks are considered to be diversifiable.
An allowance for nondiversifiable nonmarket risks is estimated as set out below: A base level allowance of 50 basis points is applied to cover the nondiversifiable nonmarket risks associated with the Groups businesses.
For the Groups Asia operations in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, additional allowances are applied for emerging market risk ranging from 100 to 250 basis points.
The level of these allowances are reviewed and updated based on an assessment of a range of predefined emerging market risk indicators, as well as the Groups exposure and experience in the business units.
During 2017, the China allowance for nonmarket risk was reduced reflecting the growth in the size of the business, increasing management exposure and experience in the country and an improvement in our risk assessment of the market.
For the Groups US business and UK and Europe business, no additional allowance is necessary.
ix Foreign currency translation Foreign currency profits and losses have been translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities have been translated at yearend exchange rates.
The principal exchange rates are shown in note A1 of the IFRS financial statements.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 351 Notes on the EEV basis results continued 14 Methodology and accounting presentation continued a Methodology continued x Taxation In determining the posttax profit for the year for covered business, the overall tax rate includes the impact of tax effects determined on a local regulatory basis.
Tax payments and receipts included in the projected cash flows to determine the value of inforce business are calculated using rates that have been announced and substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
xi Inter-company arrangements The EEV results for covered business incorporate annuities established in the PAC nonprofit subfund from vesting pension policies in SAIF which is not covered business.
The EEV results also incorporate the effect of the reinsurance arrangement of nonprofit immediate pension annuity liabilities of SAIF to the PAC nonprofit subfund.
b Accounting presentation i Analysis of post-tax profit To the extent applicable, the presentation of the EEV posttax profit for the year is consistent in the classification between operating and nonoperating results with the basis that the Group applies for the analysis of IFRS basis results.
Operating results reflect underlying results including longerterm investment returns which are determined as described in note 14 b ii and incorporate the following: New business contribution, as defined in note 14 a ii : Unwind of discount on the value of inforce business and other expected returns, as described in note 14 b iii : The impact of routine changes of estimates relating to operating assumptions, as described in note 14 b iv : and Operating experience variances, as described in note 14 b v. Nonoperating results comprise the recurrent items of: Shortterm fluctuations in investment returns: The mark to market value movements on core structural borrowings: and The effect of changes in economic assumptions.
In addition, nonoperating results include the effect of the disposal of businesses see note 17 and in 2017, the impact of US tax reform see note 7.
Total profit attributable to shareholders and basic earnings per share include these items, together with actual investment returns.
The Group believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
ii Investment returns included in operating profit For the investment element of the assets covering the net worth of longterm insurance business, investment returns are recognised in operating results at the expected longterm rate of return.
These expected returns are calculated by reference to the asset mix of the portfolio.
For the purpose of calculating the longerterm investment return to be included in the operating result of the PAC withprofits fund of M&G Prudential, where assets backing the liabilities and unallocated surplus are subject to market volatility, asset values at the beginning of the reporting period are adjusted to remove the effects of shortterm market movements as explained in note 14 b iii.
For the purpose of determining the longterm returns for debt securities of US operations for fixed annuity and other general account business, a risk margin reserve charge is included which reflects the expected longterm rate of default based on the credit quality of the portfolio.
For Jackson, interestrelated realised gains and losses are amortised to the operating results over the maturity period of the sold bonds and for equityrelated investments, a longterm rate of return is assumed, which reflects the aggregation of endofperiod riskfree rates and equity risk premium.
For US variable annuity separate account business, operating profit includes the unwind of discount on the opening value of inforce business adjusted to reflect endofperiod projected rates of return with the excess or deficit of the actual return recognised within nonoperating profit, together with related hedging activity.
For UK annuity business, rebalancing of the asset portfolio backing the liabilities to policyholders may, from time to time, take place to align it more closely with the internal benchmark of credit quality that management applies.
Such rebalancing will result in a change in the projected yield on the asset portfolio and the allowance for default risk.
The net effect of these changes is included in the operating result for the year.
iii Unwind of discount and other expected returns The Groups methodology in determining the unwind of discount and other expected returns is by reference to: The value of inforce business at the beginning of the year adjusted for the effect of current year economic and operating assumption changes : and Required capital and surplus assets.
In applying this general approach, the unwind of discount included in operating profit for M&G Prudential is described below.
352 Prudential plc Annual Report 2017 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 07  06  EEV basisresults M&G Prudential The unwind is determined by reference to an implied single risk discount rate.
The EEV riskfree rate is based on a yield curve as set out in note 14 a viii, which is used to derive a single implied discount rate which, if this rate had been used, would reproduce the same embedded value as that calculated by reference to the yield curve.
The difference between the operating profit determined using the single implied discount rate and that derived using the yield curve is included within nonoperating profit.
For withprofits business, the opening value of inforce is adjusted for the effect of shortterm investment volatility due to market movements ie smoothed.
In the summary statement of financial position and for total profit reporting, asset values and investment returns are not smoothed.
At 31 December 2017 the shareholders interest in the smoothed surplus assets used for this purpose only were 57 million lower 31 December 2016: 77 million lower than the surplus assets carried in the statement of financial position.
iv Effect of changes in operating assumptions Operating profit includes the effect of changes to noneconomic assumptions on the value of inforce at the end of the year.
For presentational purposes the effect of changes is delineated to show the effect on the opening value of inforce as operating assumption changes, with the experience variances subsequently being determined by reference to the endofyear assumptions see note 14 b v. v Operating experience variances Operating profit includes the effect of experience variances on noneconomic assumptions, such as persistency, mortality and morbidity, expenses and other factors, which are calculated with reference to the endofyear assumptions.
vi Effect of changes in economic assumptions Movements in the value of inforce business at the beginning of the year caused by changes in economic assumptions, net of the related change in the time value of cost of options and guarantees, are recorded in nonoperating results.
For M&G Prudential, the embedded value incorporates Solvency II transitional measures, which are recalculated using managements estimate of the impact of operating and market conditions at the valuation date.
The effect of changes in economic assumptions is after allowing for this recalculation.
15 Assumptions Principal economic assumptions The EEV basis results for the Groups operations have been determined using economic assumptions where the longterm expected rates of return on investments and risk discount rates are set by reference to yearend riskfree rates of return defined below for each of the Groups insurance operations.
Expected returns on equity and property asset classes and corporate bonds are derived by adding a risk premium, based on the Groups longterm view, to the riskfree rate.
The total profit that emerges over the lifetime of an individual contract as calculated using the embedded value basis is the same over time as that calculated under the IFRS basis.
Since the embedded value basis reflects discounted future cash flows, under this methodology the profit emergence is advanced, thus more closely aligning the timing of the recognition of profit with the efforts and risks of current management actions, particularly with regard to business sold during the year.
notes b c i Asia The riskfree rates of return for Asia are defined as 10year government bond yields at the end of the year.
In order to reflect Prudentials most recent assessment of the growth prospects of the region compared to other developed markets and the historically strong relationship between longterm economic growth and longterm equity returns, in a number of Asia business units, equity risk premiums were increased during 2017 by between 25 basis points and 75 basis points from those applied at 2016.
The related expected return on equity and risk discount rates have also been increased by equivalent amounts.
In addition, for a few Asia business units, expected longterm inflation assumptions were revised during 2017 to better reflect central bank inflation targets and to align with the currency of the underlying exposures.
co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 353 Notes on the EEV basis results continued 15 Assumptions continued Principal economic assumptions continued Notes a The weighted risk discount rates for Asia operations shown above have been determined by weighting each markets risk discount rates by reference to the posttax EEV basis new business contribution and the closing value of inforce business.

iv Asia The stochastic cost of guarantees is primarily of significance for the Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan operations: The principal asset classes are government and corporate bonds: The asset return models are similar to the models as described for M&G Prudential below: and The volatility of equity returns ranges from 18 per cent to 35 per cent, and the volatility of government bond yields ranges from 1.1 per cent to 2.0 per cent 2016: from 0.9 per cent to 2.3 per cent following a number of modelling changes at full year 2017 in respect of future bond returns.
v US Jackson Interest rates and equity returns are projected using a lognormal generator reflecting historical market data: Corporate bond returns are based on treasury yields plus a spread that reflects current market conditions: and The volatility of equity returns ranges from 18 per cent to 27 per cent for both years, and the standard deviation of interest rates ranges from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent 2016: from 2.3 per cent to 2.6 per cent.

co. uk Annual Report 2017 Prudential plc 355 Notes on the EEV basis results continued 15 Assumptions continued Operating assumptions vii Best estimate assumptions Best estimate assumptions are used for the cash flow projections, where best estimate is defined as the mean of the distribution of future possible outcomes.
The assumptions are reviewed actively and changes are made when evidence exists that material changes in future experience are reasonably certain.
Assumptions required in the calculation of the value of options and guarantees, for example relating to volatilities and correlations, or dynamic algorithms linking liabilities to assets, have been set equal to the best estimates and, wherever material and practical, reflect any dynamic relationships between the assumptions and the stochastic variables.
Demographic assumptions Persistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on an analysis of recent experience, but also reflect expected future experience.
Where relevant, when calculating the time value of financial options and guarantees, policyholder withdrawal rates vary in line with the emerging investment conditions according to managements expectations.
Expense assumptions Expense levels, including those of service companies that support the Groups longterm business operations, are based on internal expense analysis and are appropriately allocated to acquisition of new business and renewal of inforce business.
Exceptional expenses are identified and reported separately.
For mature business, it is Prudentials policy not to take credit for future cost reduction programmes until the actions to achieve the savings have been delivered.
Expense overruns are reported where these are expected to be shortlived, including businesses that are growing rapidly or are subscale.
For Asia operations, the expenses comprise costs borne directly and recharged costs from the Asia Regional Head Office that are attributable to covered business.
The assumed future expenses for these operations also include projections of these future recharges.
Development expenses are charged as incurred.
Corporate expenditure, which is included in other income and expenditure, comprises: Expenditure for Group Head Office, to the extent not allocated to the PAC withprofits funds, together with restructuring costs: and Expenditure of the Asia Regional Head Office that is not allocated to the covered business or asset management operations which is charged as incurred.
These costs are primarily for corporate related activities and are included within corporate expenditure.
viii Tax rates The assumed longterm effective tax rates for operations reflect the incidence of taxable profits and losses in the projected cash flows as explained in note 14 a x.
The local statutory corporate tax rates applicable for the most significant operations for 2016 and 2017 are as follows: Statutory corporate tax rates % Asia operations: Hong Kong 16.5 per cent on 5 per cent of premium income Indonesia 25.0 Malaysia 24.0 Singapore 17.0 US operations 2016 and 2017: 35.0: from 1 January 2018: 21.0 UK operations 2016: 20.0: from 1 April 2017: 19.0: from 1 April 2020: 17.0 The US tax reform changes included a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent effective from 1 January 2018 see note 7.
