Risk management objectives Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt as disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Market risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in the Groups income or the Groups net worth arising from movements in interest rates or other market prices.
Interest rate risk is the Groups principal market risk and the Group is exposed to interest rate risk as some of its borrowings are at variable interest rates.
The Group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate swaps to manage the risk.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity, after tax, to a reasonably possible 1% change in interest rates based on year end levels of debt: 2017 2016 m m Interest on borrowings 2.1 2.3 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.4 0.4 Net impact on profit of a 1% increase in interest rates 0.7 1.9 2017 2016 m m Interest on borrowings 2.1 2.3 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.4 0.4 Net impact on profit of a 1% decrease in interest rates 0.7 1.9 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual report and financial statements 2017 159 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 November 2017 continued 17.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations as they fall due.
The credit risk on the Groups liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with strong generally A and above credit ratings.
Bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with Group policy that specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
Trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas.
The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 8.1m 2016: 7.2m of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.
Included within trade and other receivables is 0.8m 2016: 0.6m which is provided against as it represents estimated irrecoverable amounts.
This allowance has been determined by a review of all significant balances that are past due considering the reason for nonpayment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
A reconciliation of the changes in this account during the year is provided below: 2017 2016 m m At start of year 0.6 0.4 Impairment losses recognised 0.5 0.4 Amounts written off as uncollectable 0.2 0.1 Impairment losses reversed 0.1 0.1 At end of year 0.8 0.6 Trade and other receivables include 2.3m 2016: 1.5m which are past due as at 30 November 2017 for which no provision has been made because the amounts are considered recoverable.
