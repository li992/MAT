Financial Statements 127 10 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies a Land and buildings Land and buildings are held at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment.
Capital work in progress is held at cost less any recognised provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs to bringing the asset to its working condition for intended use.
This includes capitalised borrowing costs.
b Fixtures and equipment Fixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use.
c Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line basis, using the following rates: Freehold buildings and leasehold properties 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Fixtures, equipment and vehicles three to 15 years Freehold land is not depreciated Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds less any associated costs of disposal with the assets carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to dispose and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
For Retail property, plant and equipment, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store or store pipeline development site.
Non-store assets, including depots and IT assets, are reviewed separately, whilst Financial Services is deemed a separate CGU.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less notional accumulated depreciation if lower.
Capitalisation of interest Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, gross of tax relief.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.
a Finance leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term.
The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges.
Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement.
b Lease incentives Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free periods.
Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term.
c Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases The Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental increases.
These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and again whenever indicators of impairment are detected and is carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
b Computer software Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Externally acquired computer software and software licences are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to ten years.
Costs relating to development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38, Intangible Assets are met.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are expensed as incurred.
When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to ten years within administrative expenses.
c Acquired intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Intangible assets with finite useful economic lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, ranging from three to ten years, within administrative expenses.
Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
For retail goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each retail chain of stores acquired.
Non-store assets, including IT assets, are reviewed separately, whilst Financial Services is deemed a separate CGU.
Where an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less notional accumulated depreciation if lower.

The CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated and the level at which it is monitored in the retailing segment are deemed to be the respective acquired retail chains of stores, whilst Financial Services is a separate CGU.
The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs with the carrying value of its goodwill.
The calculation of the Retail CGUs value in use is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the stores using the latest budget and forecast data.
Board approved cash flow projections for five years are used and then extrapolated out assuming flat cash flows and discounted at a pre-tax rate of nine per cent 2016: nine per cent over the earlier of a 25 year period being the estimated average remaining useful life of a freehold store or lease length for leasehold stores.
Financial Services CGUs value in use is calculated using Board approved cash flows discounted at a pre-tax rate of nine per cent 2016: nine per cent over a five year period with a terminal value.
Based on the operating performance of the CGUs, an impairment of goodwill of nil million was identified in the current financial year 2016: nil million.
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in any impairment of goodwill.
Additions to acquired intangibles arose from the acquisition of HRG and relates to the Argos brand.
This is being amortised over ten years.
Financial Statements 131 12 Investments in joint ventures and associates Accounting policies The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements.
Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures.
The Groups share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures and associates is included in the income statement using the equity method of accounting.
Where the Group transacts with a joint venture or associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture or associate.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group balance sheet at historical cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the entity, less any provision for impairment.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control.
The Groups principal joint venture is: Share of ordinary Country of Statutory allotted registration or year-end capital incorporation BL Sainsbury Superstores Limited British Land property investment 31 March 50% England A full list of the Groups joint ventures is included in note 37.
Joint ventures with a different year-end date to the Group are reported to include the results up to 28 February 2017, the nearest month-end to the Groups year-end.

13 Available-for-sale financial assets Accounting policies Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the movements recognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income reserves is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Interest on available-for-sale debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.

There were no disposals or impairment provisions on available-for-sale financial assets in either the current or the previous financial year.
Financial Statements 133 14 Inventories Accounting policies Inventories comprise goods held for resale and properties held for resale or in the course of development and are valued on a weighted average cost basis and carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cost includes all direct expenditure and other appropriate attributable costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.

15 Receivables a Trade and other receivables Accounting policies Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are on commercial terms.
Other receivables have both non-interest and interest bearing receivables.
Trade and other receivables are stated at their carrying amounts and are written off when management deems them uncollectable or forgiven.
2017 2016 m m Non-current Other receivables 59 92 Prepayments and accrued income 10 11 69 103 Current Trade receivables 106 96 Other receivables 312 305 418 401 Prepayments and accrued income 156 107 574 508 Current other receivables of 312 million 2016: 305 million, which include 165 million 2016: 170 million of bank funds in the course of settlement, are generally non-interest bearing.
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in sterling.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arising from its retail operations is minimal given that the customer base is large and unrelated and that the overwhelming majority of customer transactions are settled through cash or secure electronic means.
New parties wishing to obtain credit terms with the Group are credit checked prior to invoices being raised and credit limits are determined on an individual basis.
b Amounts due from Financial Services customers Accounting policies Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment and recognised on the balance sheet when cash is advanced.
For the Financial Services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending and personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups of assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level following objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
Such evidence may include a missed interest or principal payment or the breach of a banking covenant.
Provisioning on unsecured balances identified as being in arrears is calculated based on past experience, with regularly updated assumptions.
The present value of estimated cash flows recoverable is determined after taking into account any security held.
The amount of impairment is calculated by comparing the present value of the cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate with the balance sheet carrying value.
If impaired, the carrying value is adjusted and the difference charged to the income statement and a provision recognised in the balance sheet.
The written down value of the impaired loan is compounded back to the net realisable balance over time using an effective interest rate.
This is reported through interest receivable within the income statement and represents the unwinding of the discount.
A write-off is made when all or part of a loan or advance is deemed uncollectable or forgiven.
Write-offs are charged against previously established provisions for impairment or directly to the income statement.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts written off decrease the charge for loan impairment in the income statement.
134 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 15 Receivables continued An allowance for impairment losses is also maintained in respect of assets which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been identified as such, based on historical loss experience and other relevant factors.
This includes analysis of the likelihood of a particular balance to move into an arrears status within a defined period of time and application of an appropriate loss rate.
The emergence period into an arrears state represents the average time elapsed between the loss trigger event and default.
The methodology and assumptions used are regularly reviewed to reduce any differences between estimates and actual results.

d Major counterparties The Group has two major counterparties totalling 55 million 2016: two major counterparties totalling 43 million.
No major counterparty balances are considered overdue or impaired.
16 Assets and liabilities held for sale Accounting policies Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification and the assets and liabilities are available-for-sale in their present condition.
Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to dispose.

Interest on the notes is repayable at a floating rate linked to three-month LIBOR and their contractual repayment is determined by cash flows on the relevant personal loans included in the collateral pool.
Other deposits of 509 million 2016: 248 million relate to deposits from wholesale counterparties.
18 Provisions Accounting policies Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
The need for provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected rental income, is assessed when the leased property becomes vacant and is no longer used in the operations of the business or when the leased property relates to an unprofitable trading store.
Provisions for dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease-by-lease basis.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised where expected cash outflows exceed the anticipated future benefits.
The amounts provided are based on the Groups best estimate of the likely committed outflow net of anticipated future benefits and after any impairment of pipeline development site assets where applicable.
The costs of long service awards are accrued over the period the service is provided by the employee when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably.
Liabilities recognised in respect of long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring.

The convertible bond reserve represents the equity component of the 450 million convertible bond issued in November 2014.
The capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of B shares.
Shareholders approved a 680 million return of share capital, by way of a B share scheme, at the Companys Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 July 2004.
The final redemption date for B shares was 18 July 2007 and all transactions relating to the B shares have now been completed.
21 Perpetual securities Accounting policies and key information Perpetual securities perpetual capital securities and perpetual convertible bonds are issued securities that qualify for recognition as equity.
Accordingly any periodic returns are accounted for as dividends and recognised directly in equity and as a liability at the time it becomes obligated to pay the periodic return.
Any associated tax impacts are recognised directly in equity.
On 30 July 2015 the Group issued 250 million of perpetual subordinated capital securities and 250 million of perpetual subordinated convertible bonds, collectively known as perpetual securities.
Costs directly associated with the issue of 6 million were offset against the value of the proceeds.
The securities are perpetual with no fixed redemption date.
Holders of the perpetual securities do not benefit from any put option rights however the Group does have the right to call the perpetual subordinated capital securities at their principal amount on 30 July 2020, and the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds on 30 July 2021.
The perpetual subordinated convertible bonds may be converted into ordinary shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time up to 23 July 2021 at a conversion price of 327.4615 pence.
The Group has the right to defer coupons on the perpetual securities on any coupon payment date where the Company has not either paid a dividend on its ordinary shares or bought back ordinary shares excluding shares bought to satisfy employee share schemes within the previous 12 month period.
The coupon rate on the perpetual subordinated capital securities increases after the fifth anniversary and for the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds after the sixth anniversary.
The next coupon date on the perpetual securities is 30 July 2017.
As the Company paid a dividend to ordinary shareholders in the 12 months prior to this date in January 2017, the periodic distributions of 7 million for the perpetual subordinated capital securities and 16 million for the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds have been recognised in the financial year.

Financial Statements 139 23 Financial risk management The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity risk and capital risk.
Financial risk management is managed by a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines which are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.
The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by identifying financial exposures and setting appropriate risk limits and controls.
The risk management policies also ensure sufficient liquidity is available to the Group to meet foreseeable financial obligations and that cash assets are invested safely.
Financial risk management with respect to Financial Services is separately managed within the Financial Services governance structure.
The risks are more fully described in the Financial Services section below.
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange and commodity exposures, and cross currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by Board approved policies which prohibits the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The principal operational cash flow of the Group is largely stable and predictable reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector and the cyclical profile of the non-food retail sector.
Cash flow forecasts are produced to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity policy sets a minimum funding headroom of 400 million in excess of forecast net debt over a rolling 12 month time horizon.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a core of long-dated borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow commitments and holding contingent committed credit facilities.
The Group maintains a contingent committed revolving credit facility of 1,150 million.
The 1,150 million facility is split into two tranches, a 500 million Facility A maturing in May 2019 and a 650 million Facility B maturing in May 2020.
As at 11 March 2017, nil had been drawn 2016: nil.

Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk of a financial loss arising from counterparty default or non-performance in respect of the Groups holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets, deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities, trade and other receivables and loans and advances to customers.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 6,967 million 2016: 5,554 million, equivalent to the Groups total financial assets, and of this amount 5,620 million relates to Financial Services 2016: 4,326 million.
The Group excluding Financial Services sets counterparty limits for each of its banking and investment counterparties based on their credit ratings, the minimum unsecured long-term credit rating accepted by the Group is BBB Standard & Poors and Fitch or Baa1 Moodys or, in the case of sterling liquidity funds, AAA or Aaa MR1 from Moodys.
In the event of a split credit rating, the lower rating applies.

Under these agreements cash collateral is posted by one party to the other party should the fair value of the financial derivative exceed a pre-agreed level.
As at 11 March 2017, the Group held no collateral against financial derivative assets 2016: nil.
Financial Services has derivatives that are governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and their associated credit support annex bilateral agreements whereby if the fair value exceeds a pre-agreed level, cash collateral is exchanged.
As at 11 March 2017, Financial Services and its subsidiary undertakings had provided collateral of 19 million 2016: 13 million against the derivatives.
The Group also operates a cash pooling arrangement and collective net overdraft facility with its main clearing bank.
As at 11 March 2017, the Group had 6 million 2016: 3 million under this facility.
Foreign currency risk Currency risk is the risk of increased costs arising from unexpected movements in exchange rates impacting the Groups foreign currency denominated supply contracts.
The Groups currency risk policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the Groups income statement by requiring highly probable foreign currency cash flows to be hedged.
Highly probable future cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are hedged on a layered basis using foreign currency forward contracts.
The Group has exposure to currency risk on balances held in foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments.
The Group considers that a ten per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility.
The impact of a ten per cent movement in the exchange rate of US dollar and euro versus sterling as at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant, is summarised in the table below: 2017 2016 2017 Change in 2016 Change in Change in exchange Change in exchange exchange rate impact exchange rate impact rate impact on cash rate impact on cash on post-tax flow hedge on post-tax flow hedge profit reserve profit reserve -10% -10% -10% -10% Group m m m m USD GBP 12 15 114 139 3 4 48 59 EUR GBP 2 2 10 13 3 4 9 11 The year-on-year increase in foreign exchange related sensitivities is largely as a result of the acquisition of Home Retail Group.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of increased costs or lower income arising from unexpected movements in interest rates and inflation rates impacting on the Groups borrowing and investment portfolios.
The Groups interest rate policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating interest and inflation rates by maintaining a diversified mix of fixed rate, floating rate and variable capped rate liabilities.
Interest on financial instruments is classified as fixed rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings are less frequent than once every 12 months.
Interest on financial instruments is classified as floating rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings occur every 12 months or more frequently.
Floating rate instruments are considered variable capped rate if the nominal interest rate is subject to a cap.

i Cash flow sensitivity for floating rate instruments The Group considers that a 100 basis point movement in interest rates is a reasonable measure of volatility.
The sensitivity of floating rate balances to a change of 100 basis points in the interest rate or such lesser amount as would result in a zero rate of interest at the balance sheet date is shown below: 2017 2016 2017 Impact on 2016 Impact on Impact on cash flow Impact on cash flow post-tax hedge post-tax hedge loss reserve profit reserve m m m m Change in floating rate -100bps 10 5 2 2 7 5 3 3 ii Cash flow sensitivity for variable capped rate liabilities The Group holds 761 million of capped inflation-linked borrowings 2016: 798 million of which 400 million 2016: 400 million have been swapped into fixed rate borrowings using inflation rate swaps maturing April 2017 to April 2019.
The Group considers that a 100 basis point movement in the RPI rate is a reasonable measure of volatility.

The Group hedges own use consumption of electricity and gas with forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with its suppliers.
The Group uses a combination of purchasing agreements and financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference.

The Boards capital objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support the Groups strategic objectives, provide optimal returns for shareholders and safeguard the Groups status as a going concern.
There has been no change to capital risk management policies during the year.
The Board monitors a broad range of financial metrics including return on capital employed, balance sheet gearing and fixed charge cover.
The Board can manage the Groups capital structure by diversifying the debt portfolio, adjusting the size and timing of dividends paid to shareholders, recycling capital through sale and leaseback transactions, issuing new shares or repurchasing shares in the open market and flexing capital expenditure.
From time-to-time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes: however the Group does not operate a defined share buy-back plan.
Part of the Groups capital risk management is to ensure compliance with the general covenants included in the Groups various borrowing facilities.
There have been no breaches of general covenants in the financial year ended 11 March 2017.
Financial Statements 145 23 Financial risk management continued Information relating to Financial Services capital risk management is detailed below.
Financial Services Sainsburys Bank including Argos Financial Services has identified a set of primary risk types see table that are overseen by a dedicated second line function.
These risks are actively managed through primary risk policies and supporting policy standards that clearly articulate the rules, boundaries and measures by which the risks are controlled and help each colleague to understand their individual responsibilities.

resources and or increase capital requirements.
The annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP determines the adequacy of capital resources as well as mitigating actions.
Further detail on each of these risks is shown below: Liquidity and funding risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot meet its payment obligations as they fall due, or can only do so at extreme cost.
We seek to ensure that we can meet our financial obligations at all times, even under liquidity stress conditions.
The annual Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP enables the Bank to: 1 demonstrate that it understands the liquidity risks it is running 2 assess its liquidity needs under various stress scenarios and 3 put in place appropriate controls to mitigate liquidity risks.
In meeting its internal limits as well as PRA requirements, the Bank maintains a stock of high quality liquid assets that can be readily monetised by outright sale or repurchase agreement to meet the Banks obligations to depositors and other creditors.
The Banks Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR and Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR are regularly monitored and forecast alongside cash flow and funding ratios.
We prepare long-term and short-term forecasts to assess liquidity requirements, taking into account factors such as ATM cash management, contractual maturities and customer deposit patterns stable or less stable deposits as well as outflows regarding pipelines and commitments.
These reports support daily liquidity management, with early warning indicators reviewed on a daily basis and appropriate triggers for escalation and action in line with the risk appetite, Liquidity and Funding Policy and Liquidity Contingency Plan.

Financial Primary Risk 146 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that the value of the Banks assets, liabilities, capital and earnings are exposed to the adverse change of the market risk drivers.
The Banks market risks include Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book IRRBB and Foreign Exchange FX Risk.
The Bank does not have a trading book.
Interest rate risk IRRBB arises from interest rates movements which impact present value and timing of future cash flows resulting in changes to the underlying value of a banks assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and hence its economic value.
Interest rates movements also affect a banks earnings by altering interest-sensitive income and expenses, affecting its net interest income.
The main types of interest rate risk faced by the Bank are: a R e-pricing gap risk: the risk arising from timing differences in the interest rate changes of bank assets and liabilities e. g. fixed rate personal loans and instant access savings accounts.
b Yield curve risk: the risk arising from changes in the slope and shape of the yield curve.
c Basis risk: risk arising from imperfect correlation between different interest rate indices e. g. administered rate on savings products and treasury assets linked to LIBOR.
d Prepayment risk: the risk arising from the timing of customer prepayments which differ from planning and hedging assumptions.
e Pipeline risk: the risk of a customer drawing down, or not, a product at a rate which is unfavourable for the Bank.
Interest risk exposure is actively managed within limits that are aligned with the Banks risk appetite by using financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and by taking into account natural hedges between assets and liabilities.
The hedging strategies are implemented to ensure the Bank remains within its limits and that it takes advantage of natural hedging opportunities between fixed rate assets and liabilities with similar re-pricing characteristics.
In order to measure the exposure to interest rate risk under various interest rates shock scenarios, the Bank uses both economic value and earnings-based metrics: Market Value Sensitivity and Earnings at Risk.
These metrics are monthly monitored and reported to ALCO.
For interest rate risk measurement, products are allocated within re-pricing gap analysis based on their nearest re-pricing date all non-maturing deposits are assumed to re-price in month one and personal loans are allocated according to behavioural repayment profile.
Foreign exchange risk The Bank is exposed to FX risk through its holding of cash denominated in foreign currencies, primarily euro and US dollar, within its Travel Money bureaux in J Sainsburys stores.
Starting February 2017 the FX positions are hedged on a daily basis.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from the failure of customers or other counterparties to settle their financial obligations to the Bank.
Retail credit risk Management of credit risk in respect of retail customers makes use of automated credit decisioning techniques both scorecards and policy rules for new applications.
In addition, behavioural scoring is used to assess the conduct of customers accounts on an on-going basis, for example granting extensions to limits.
Underwriting is undertaken by specialist teams in operational areas to complement these processes.
The Retail Credit Risk Committee ensures that appropriate policies are established and adhered to and this is subject to further oversight from the Board Risk Committee.
Internal Audit teams carry out regular reviews of credit risk processes and policies are reviewed and re-approved on an annual basis.
Wholesale and derivative credit risk The Bank invests its liquidity resources in eligible investment securities that qualify for the regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR and internal Operational Liquidity Pool OLP.
These investments include the Bank of Englands BoE reserve account, UK government securities gilts or Treasury bills, multilateral development bank securities, government guaranteed agency securities UK regulated covered bond programmes and asset backed securities.
Limits are established for all counterparty and asset class exposures based on their respective credit quality and market liquidity.
Consideration is also given to geographical region and the strength of relevant sovereign credit ratings.
Derivatives are subject to the same credit risk control procedures as are applied to other wholesale market instruments and the credit risk arising from mark to market derivative valuations is mitigated by daily margin calls, posting cash collateral to cover exposures.
Daily monitoring is undertaken by the Banks Treasury department, including early warning indicators with appropriate triggers for escalation.

Financial Services capital resources unaudited The following table analyses the regulatory capital resources under both transitional and end point measures of CRD IV for which there is no difference in the case of the Bank.
CRD IV regulations are being phased in over a five year period from 2013 2018.
From a prudential perspective, the Bank is monitored and supervised on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary, Home Retail Group Card Services Limited, from the point of acquisition of Argos Financial Services onwards.
The Bank has obtained an individual consolidation waiver from the PRA, which allows the Bank to monitor its capital position on a consolidated basis only.
Therefore, the 28 February 2017 capital position shown below is on a regulatory consolidated basis, but the comparative shows the Bank standalone position.
2017 2016 m m Common Equity Tier 1 CET 1 capital: Ordinary share capital 566 436 Allowable reserves 148 167 Regulatory adjustments 147 118 Total Common Equity Tier 1 CET 1 capital 567 485 Tier 1 capital 567 485 Regulatory capital is calculated under the Capital Requirements Regulations and Capital Requirements Directive collectively known as CRD IV as enacted in the UK.
Common Equity Tier 1 CET 1 capital includes ordinary share capital, other reserves, losses and regulatory deductions.
The Bank does not currently hold any Tier 2 capital.
Financial Statements 149 23 Financial risk management continued The movement of CET 1 capital during the financial year is analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m At 1 March 2017 1 March 2016 485 354 Share capital issued 130 137 Verified profit attributable to shareholders 4 6 Verified losses of subsidiary undertakings 17 Other reserve movements 2 2 Increase in intangible assets 29 14 At 28 February 2017 29 February 2016 567 485 Leverage ratio unaudited The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted assets, which is measured below on a regulatory consolidated basis.
The denominator represents the total non-risk weighted assets of the regulatory group Bank and Home Retail Group Card Services Limited adjusted for certain off balance sheet exposures, assets and regulatory deductions and provides a non-risk-weighted backstop capital measure.
The leverage ratio is planned to become a Pillar 1 measure from 1 January 2018.
The leverage ratio is calculated below as at 28 February 2017 this represents both transitional and end point CRD IV measures.
The Banks leverage ratio of 8.6 per cent exceeds the minimum Basel leverage ratio of 3 per cent.

During the period to 28 February 2017, the Bank received planned injections of 130 million of ordinary share capital to support the increased capital requirements resulting from: the acquisition of Argos Financial Services and forecast costs and deductible intangible assets generated through the development of flexible banking platforms.
Capital adequacy is monitored on an on-going basis by senior management, the ALCO, the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.
Our submissions to the PRA in the year have shown that the Bank has complied with all externally imposed capital requirements.
The Banks capital ratio of 13.3 per cent exceeds internal and regulatory thresholds.
Sainsburys Bank plc, as the principal regulated entity within Financial Services, will disclose Pillar 3 information as required by the Capital Requirements Regulations and PRA prudential sourcebook on the J Sainsbury plc external website.
150 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments Accounting policies a Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale AFS.
AFS investments are initially measured at fair value including transaction costs and are recognised at the trade date.
Financial assets held at FVTPL are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed.
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading and those designated at FVTPL at inception.
FVTPL are derivatives classified as held for trading unless they are accounted for as an effective hedging instrument.
Financial assets at FVTPL are recorded at fair value, with any fair value gains or losses recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the movements recognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income reserves are recycled is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Interest on AFS debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Group has no intention of trading these loans and receivables and include amounts due from Financial Services customers and amounts due from other banks.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method.
Income from these financial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Within Financial Services, securities sold subject to standard sale and repurchase agreements repos are not derecognised where the Bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership by virtue of the predetermined repurchase price.
The counterparty liability is included in other deposits.
b Impairment of financial assets An assessment of whether there is objective evidence of impairment is carried out for all financial assets or groups of financial assets at the balance sheet date.
An assessment of impairment may be of individual assets individual impairment or of a portfolio of assets collective impairment where indicators arise.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is considered to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
For individual impairment, the principal loss event is one or more missed payments, although other loss events can also be taken into account, including arrangements in place to pay less than the contractual payments, fraud and bankruptcy or other financial difficulty indicators.
An assessment of collective impairment will be made of financial assets with similar risk characteristics.
For these assets, portfolio loss experience is used to provide objective evidence of impairment.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists on loans and receivables, impairment provisions are made to reduce the carrying value of financial assets to the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the charge to the income statement reflects the movement in the level of provisions made, together with amounts written off net of recoveries in the year.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost is considered in determining whether the asset is impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Interest will continue to accrue on all financial assets, based on the written down carrying value based on the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
To the extent that a provision may be increased or decreased in subsequent periods, the recognition of interest will be based on the latest balance net of provision.
c Financial Services loans and advances including impairment For Financial Services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending, storecard lending and personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups of assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level following objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
The written down value of the impaired loan is compounded back to its net realisable balance over time using an effective interest rate.
A write-off is made when all or part of a claim is deemed uncollectable or forgiven.
Financial Statements 151 24 Financial instruments continued An allowance for impairment losses is also maintained in respect of assets which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been identified as such, based on historical loss experience and other relevant factors.
Interest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts, other deposits and amounts due to Sainsburys Bank customers are recorded initially at fair value, which is generally the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
d Financial liabilities Financial liabilities charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the conversion option which is recognised in shareholders equity, net of income tax effects and is not subsequently remeasured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts at the date of issue.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
e Fair value estimation The methods and assumptions applied in determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed below in the financial disclosure section.
f Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks.
All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are also measured at fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognised in the income statement as finance income or costs as they arise.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risks being hedged and an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship to ensure it is highly effective on an ongoing basis.
Where a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in fair value are recognised depending on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged as follows: a Cash flow hedges Hedge relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash flows resulting from a highly probable forecasted transaction.
These include the exchange rate risk of inventory purchases denominated in foreign currency, as well as the commodity risk on purchases of power and fuel.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
b Fair value hedges Hedge relationships are classified as fair value hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the change in the fair value of a financial asset or liability due to movements in interest rates.
The changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.
The hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk, with the corresponding adjustment made in the income statement.
c Portfolio fair value hedging During the period Sainsburys Bank used portfolio fair value hedging as a risk management tool for hedging interest rate risk on the personal loans portfolio.
Portfolio fair value hedging allows the designation of the whole or part of a portfolio of assets or liabilities with similar risk exposures.
The hedged item can be designated based on expected maturities to match the hedging derivative maturity.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.

Fair value hedges Interest rate swaps The Group holds a 160 million portfolio of interest rate swaps 2016: 206 million to hedge a portion of fixed rate borrowings maturing in April 2018.
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives fixed rate interest and pays floating rate interest.
Financial Services holds a 3,000 million portfolio of interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges 2016: 2,705 million.

All derivatives are designated into effective fair value hedge accounting relationships.
For the year to 11 March 2017, the fair value movement in the Groups interest rate swaps resulted in a charge to the income statement of 7 million 2016: 6 million.
The fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate borrowings and Sainsburys Bank loans and advances to customers resulted in a credit to the income statement of 6 million 2016: 6 million.
Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps The Group holds a 400 million 2016: 400 million portfolio of inflation rate swaps to hedge a portion of the inflation linked secured loan due 2031.
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives annual RPI inflation subject to a cap at five per cent and floor at nil per cent and pays fixed rate interest.
The Group holds a 100 million 2016: 100 million portfolio of interest rate swaps to hedge 100 million of a 200 million floating rate bank loan due 2019.
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives floating rate interest and pays fixed rate interest.
As at 11 March 2017, an unrealised loss of 4 million 2016: loss of 13 million is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
This loss will be transferred to the income statement over the next 24 months.
Foreign exchange forward contracts The Group holds a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its future foreign currency trading liabilities.
As at 11 March 2017 the Group had forward purchased a net 135 million 2016: 127 million and sold sterling with maturities from March 2017 to July 2018 2016: March 2016 to February 2017 and forward purchased US$1,521 million 2016: US$763 million and sold sterling with maturities from March 2017 to June 2018 2016: March 2016 to June 2017.
As at 11 March 2017, an unrealised profit of 28 million 2016: 16 million is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the forward contracts.
This profit will be transferred to the income statement over the next 15 months.
During the year a credit to the income statement of 83 million was transferred from the cash flow hedge equity reserve and included in cost of sales 2016: 12 million credit.
Financial Statements 153 24 Financial instruments continued Commodity forward contracts The Group holds a portfolio of commodity forward contracts to hedge its own use fuel consumption over the next 24 months.
At 11 March 2017, an unrealised gain of 3 million 2016: loss of 5 million is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the commodity contracts.
This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 24 months.
Derivatives not in a hedge relationship Some of the Groups derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore not designated in a hedging relationship.
In addition, where gains or losses on a derivative contract economically offset the losses or gains on an underlying transaction, the derivative is not designated as being in a hedging relationship.
Interest rate and foreign exchange swaps The Group holds a 295 million 2016: 327 million portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss to convert floating rate obligations into fixed rates.
Under the terms of the swaps the Group receives floating rate interest and pays fixed rate interest.

Under the terms of the swaps the Group receives fixed rate interest and pays floating rate interest.
Commodity forward contracts Commodity forward contracts at fair value through profit and loss relate to the Groups long-term fixed price power purchase agreements with independent producers.
Fair value Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amount and the fair value of financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements at a value other than fair value.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded.
Where market values are not available, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, other receivables, overdrafts and payables are assumed to approximate to their book values.

154 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments continued The fair value of financial assets as disclosed in the table above as at 11 March 2017 was 4,640 million 2016: 3,337 million.
The fair value of the financial assets has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and is within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of financial liabilities was 7,508 million 2016: 6,366 million of which 473 million 2016: 473 million has been determined using market values and is within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
The remaining 7,035 million 2016: 5,893 million has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and is within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are recognised at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date.
This level includes listed equity securities and debt instrument on public exchanges: Level 2 fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
The fair value of financial instruments is determined by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates: and Level 3 fair value measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
