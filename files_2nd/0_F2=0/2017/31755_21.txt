The committee spent considerable time determining what the appropriate approach to STIP target-setting was in an environment where budgeted performance was expected to decline slightly compared with the prior year outturn.
Previously the committee had held a view that incentives should not be paid for performance that lagged the prior year.
They concluded that, whilst this was a good approach, it should not hold in exceptional circumstances where external circumstances, such as sugar pricing, impacted on budget expectations.
The threshold was set at a level that the committee felt was right for the business and fair to investors.
Long Term Incentive Plan 201417 The performance measures for each three-year LTIP cycle are set by the committee.
Awards are made annually, at the discretion of the committee, and eligible executives receive shares at the end of the performance period, subject to achievement of the performance measures.
For the 201417 cycle, after adjustment for a change in the way that sugar cane roots are accounted for, the adjusted EPS performance range was 120.11p for threshold vesting, 130.67p for target vesting and 141.94p for maximum vesting.
The board encourages management to take action, at the most appropriate time, for the long-term benefit of the business and the Remuneration committee reviews any impact this may have on incentive outcomes.
This includes the restructuring and reorganisation of our businesses to ensure the optimisation of performance for the long term.
This year our executives have taken right and prudent action in restructuring some of the businesses but the cost of this restructuring, which has been charged in arriving at adjusted earnings per share, was greater than usual.
The Remuneration committee has examined the relevant costs in detail and decided that, in line with the discretion afforded to them under our remuneration policy, the measure used for LTIP purposes this year should not be reduced by the cost of this restructuring, over and above the typical annual level of such costs.
The committee last exercised its discretion on the LTIP in 2013 when incentive outcomes were reduced.
Scheme interests audited information LTIP allocations in 2016 Under the remuneration policy that was approved in 2016, conditional share awards were granted under the LTIP on 12 December 2016.
In addition, further awards were made during the year, following approval by the committee, to new starters or newly-promoted individuals who were eligible to participate.
The share price used to determine the number of shares in an allocation was the average of the closing share prices on the five trading days immediately preceding the award date.
All awards are settled using shares bought in the market.
The table below details the conditional share interests awarded to the executive directors during the year in respect of the 2016-19 LTIP.
The awards made were in line with the existing remuneration policy and are subject to performance conditions over the vesting period.
