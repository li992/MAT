Dividends What dividends have been paid and proposed for the year?
The Board recommends that a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017 of 10.55p per share will be paid to shareholders on 4 September 2017, taking the full year proposed dividend in respect of 2016 17 to 15.4p 2015 16: 14.0p, 2014 15: 12.4p which amounts to approximately 1,532m 2015 16: 1,324m, 2014 15: 1,028m.
This final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and therefore the liability of approximately 1,050m 2015 16: 954m, 2014 15: 712m has not been included in these financial statements.
The proposed dividend will be payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 11 August 2017.
The value of 1,436m 2015 16: 1,078m, 2014 15: 925m for the final and interim dividends is disclosed in our statement of changes in equity.
This value may differ from the amount shown for equity dividends paid in the group cash flow statement, which represents the actual cash paid in relation to dividend cheques that have been presented over the course of the financial year.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill recognised in a business combination does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets.
As a result, the recoverable amount, being the value in use, is determined at a cash generating unit CGU level.
How do we determine our CGUs?
The determination of our CGUs is judgemental.
The identification of CGUs involves an assessment of whether the asset or group of assets generate largely independent cash inflows.
This involves consideration of how our core assets are operated and whether these generate independent revenue streams.
Our CGUs are deemed to be Consumer, EE, Business and Public Sector, Global Services and Wholesale and Ventures which are the same units we report in our segmental reporting.
For impairment purposes goodwill is tested at the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and cannot be larger than our operating segments.
We test goodwill at the CGU level.
What other critical estimates and assumptions have we made?
During the year we re-allocated goodwill among our CGUs based on the relative fair value of the business transferred to reflect our new line of business structure effective as of 1 April 2016.
We estimated the relative fair values on a discounted cash flow basis using the three-year financial plans effective at the time of the re-organisation.
The assumptions used were set in the same way as those used in our value in use calculations as set out below.
Our value in use calculations require estimates in relation to uncertain items, including managements expectations of future revenue growth, operating costs, profit margins, operating cash flows, and the discount rate for each CGU.
Future cash flows used in the value in use calculations are based on our latest Board approved three-year financial plans.
Expectations about future growth reflect the expectations of growth in the markets to which the CGU relates.
The future cash flows are discounted using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
The discount rate used in each CGU is adjusted for the risk specific to the asset, including the countries in which cash flow will be generated, for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
The group is required to test goodwill acquired in a business combination annually for impairment.
This was carried out as at 31 March 2017.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment and sensitivities are disclosed below.
How have we carried out our goodwill impairment review?
We perform an annual goodwill impairment review, based on our CGUs.
From 1 April 2016, we re-organised our lines of business resulting in the change of the CGUs that have associated goodwill.
Weve now allocated goodwill to Consumer, EE, Business and Public Sector, Global Services and Wholesale and Ventures.
Previously no goodwill was allocated to Wholesale and Ventures.
In addition to this new CGU, to which goodwill has been allocated, there have been changes to the amount allocated to the other CGUs as a result of the re-organisation.
These CGUs represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to these CGUs as follows: Business and Public Global Wholesale Consumer EE Sector Services and Ventures Total m m m m m m At 31 March 2015 80 220 1,096 1,396 Acquisitions note 14 1,103 4,917 439 6,459 Exchange differences 3 49 52 At 31 March 2016 1,183 4,917 662 1,145 7,907 Re-organisation 2,149 1,921 709 937 Exchange differences 10 135 145 Acquisitions and disposals 23 5 18 At 31 March 2017 1,183 2,768 2,570 571 942 8,034 How do we calculate the recoverable amount?
The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a three-year period.
They reflect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
The value in use calculation includes a fourth year estimate of cash flows which is held flat from the last year assumed in the financial plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows beyond the fourth-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.

Intangible assets continued What discount rate have we used?
The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from our post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The pre-tax discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2016 17 was 8.6% 2015 16: 8.8%.
Weve used the same discount rate for all CGUs except Global Services where we have used 9.0% reflecting higher risk in some of the countries in which Global Services operates.
What growth rates have we used?
The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the forecast market growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that market.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the expected long-term average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
The perpetuity growth rate for Global Services was 2.4% 2015 16: 2.3% and 2.0% 2015 16: 2.0% for Business and Public Sector, Consumer and EE and 2.0% 2015 16: nil for Wholesale and Ventures.
What sensitivities have we applied?
There is significant headroom in Business and Public Sector, Consumer, Wholesale and Ventures and EE.
No reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.
For Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 594m 2015 16: 6,900m.
Any of thefollowing changes in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount for the CGU to equal its carrying amount: r eduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.4% assumption applied to a revised assumption of no growth: an incr ease in the discount rate from the 9.0% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 11%: and shor tfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in operating cash flows decreasing by 27% each year and in perpetuity.
