Notes to the Group Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2017 1.
Reporting entity Genus plc the Company is a public company limited by shares incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
Its registered office is Matrix House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4DZ.
The Group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
We have used the equity method to account for the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates.
Our business model on pages 4 and 7 explains the Groups operations and principal activities.
Basis of preparation We have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Unless otherwise stated, we have consistently applied the significant accounting policies set out below to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
The going concern statement has been included in the Directors Report on page 82 and forms part of these statements.
In note 5 we have reclassified the comparative period to reflect the change in operating segments and amendments in non-current assets between geographical regions, in note 9 we have restated the comparative employee costs to conform with the current period definition and in note 15 we reclassified a prior year misclassification between the two bovine categories changes in fair value of biological assets and inventory transferred to cost of sales at fair value, also impacting the comparative in note 8 cost of inventories recognised as an expense.
Functional and presentation currency We present the Group financial statements in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
All financial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Use of estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect our application of accounting policies and our reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
We review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise revisions to accounting estimates in the period in which we revise the estimate and in any future periods affected.
Note 4 provides information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements we made in applying accounting policies that have the most effect on the amounts we recognised in the financial statements.
Alternative performance measures APMs In reporting financial information, the Group presents APMs, which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS.
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide stakeholders with additional helpful information on the performance of the business.
The APMs are consistent with how the business performance is planned and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board and the Executive Leadership Committee.
Some of these measures are also used for the purpose of setting remuneration targets.
The key APMs that the Group uses include: adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and net debt.
The Group reports some financial measures, on both a reported and constant currency basis.
The constant currency basis, which is an APM, retranslates the previous year results at the average actual periodic exchange rates used in the current financial year.
This measure is presented as a means of eliminating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the year-on-year reported results.
The Group makes certain adjustments to the statutory profit measures in order to derive many of these APMs.
The Groups policy is to exclude items that are considered to be significant in both nature and or quantum and where treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with additional useful information to assess the year-on-year trading performance of the Group.
On this basis, the following were included within adjusted items for the year ended 30 June 2017: net IAS 41 valuation movements on biological assetsmovements can be materially volatile and do not directly correlate to the underlying trading performance in the period.
Furthermore, the movement is non-cash related and many assumptions used in the valuation model are based on future projections rather than current trading: amortisation of acquired intangible assetsby excluding it helps the comparability between acquired operations and organically grown operations, as the latter are not able to recognise internally generated intangible assets.
Adjusting for amortisation provides a more consistent basis for comparison between the two: share-based payments this expense is considered to be relatively volatile and is not fully reflective of the current period trading as the performance criteria are based on earnings per share performance over a three-year period and include estimates of future period performance: and exceptional items are items which either due to their size or their nature are excluded to improve the understanding of the Companys underlying performance, see note 7 for further details.
The reconciliation between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is shown on the face of the Group Income Statement.
All other reconciliations are included within the Financial Review section.

Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as awhole This section sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statement, the policy has been described in that note.
We have also detailed below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our financial reporting.
Accounting convention We prepare the Group financial statements under the historical cost convention, except for our biological assets, sharebased payment expense, pension liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with IFRS, we measure: biological assets at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of distribution and selling expenses: share-based payment expense: pension liabilities: and certain financial instruments at fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities the Group controls.
We have control of an entity when we are exposed, or have the rights, to variable returns from the entity and have the ability to affect the returns through power over the entity.
In assessing control, we take into account potential voting rights that we can currently exercise or convert.
We fully consolidate the results of subsidiaries we acquire from the date that control transfers to the Group.
We cease consolidating the results of subsidiaries we cease to control from the date that control passes.
In preparing the Group financial statements, we eliminate intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment, to the extent of our interest in the investee.
We eliminate unrealised losses in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Foreign currencies We record foreign currency transactions in the relevant Group entitys functional currency, at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
At each balance sheet date, we retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation in the Group Income Statement.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency, we translate them at the exchange rate at the transaction date.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in a foreign currency, we translate them at the prevailing exchange rate on the date we determined the fair value.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
We translate these operations revenues and expenses using an average rate for the period.
When exchange differences arise from translating foreign operations into Sterling, or from the fair value movement of related effective hedges, we take them to the foreign currency translation reserve.
When we dispose of a foreign operation, we release these differences to the Income Statement.
Exchange movements on inter-Company loans designated as long-term funding are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve, together with any related taxation.
The principal components of the Groups revenue and their respective accounting treatments are: Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary products, which we recognise when risks and rewards transfer to the customer or distributor.
This is either when we ship to customers or on delivery, depending on the terms of sale.
Royalties, which we recognise when receivable.
We receive royalty payments from certain porcine customers based on key performance variables, such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average slaughter weight of the animals born.
This amount is confirmed directly to Genus by the customer.
Revenue from consulting, which represent the amounts we charged for services we provided during the year, including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax.
We recognise services provided but not yet billed as revenue, based on a fair value assessment of the work we have delivered and our contractual right to receive payment.
Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, we do not recognise any revenue until the event occurs.
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion of the contract is determined based on the fair value of services provided to date.
Revenue from the slaughter of porcine animals, which we recognised when the risks and rewards transfer to the slaughterhouse.

Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as awhole continued Research and development We undertake research with the aim of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, and recognise this expenditure in the income statement as we incur it.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities.
When research projects achieve technical feasibility and are commercially viable, our policy is to capitalise further development costs within intangible assets, in accordance with IAS38.
Our development activities include developing and maintaining our porcine genetic nucleus herd and our bovine pre-stud herds.
We do not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds, as their fair value is included in the fair value of the Groups biological assets, in accordance with IAS 41.
We disclose the costs of research and herd development activities, as required by IAS 38.
New standards and interpretations The following new standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current period: Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint ventures, IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements, IAS 1 Disclosure Initiatives: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception: Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Method of Depreciation and Amortisation: and Annual Improvements to IFRS 2012 2014 Cycle.
There has been no significant impact on the results or disclosures for the current period from the adoption of these new standards and interpretations.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted At the date of authorisation of these Group financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU.
These standards and interpretations have not been applied in preparing these Group financial statements: Annual improvement 2014-2016 cycle: IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transaction and Advance Consideration: IAS 7 amendments Disclosure Initiative: IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses: IFRS 2 amendments Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale or Contribution of Assets Between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: and IFRS 16 Leases.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new pronouncements on its results, financial position and cash flows.
Itis not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has beencompleted.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3 or in the specific note the policy relates to, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements Defined benefit pension schemes note 27 Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are also based on significant estimates.
Judgements required included the extent to which we should provide for any amounts that might become payable under our joint and several liability in respect of the Milk Pension Fund MPF, and the extent of additional liability required under IFRIC 14.
Estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainty Determination of the fair value of biological assets note 15 Determining the fair values of our bovine and porcine biological assets requires significant estimates and assumptions.
Following is a list of these significant estimates and assumptions, showing whether we consider them to be observable or unobservable inputs to the fair value determination.
In addition we identify those inputs that are readily obtainable transactional data or open market prices.

The value in use calculation requires us to estimate the future cash flows arising from the CGU, the appropriate discount rate and the long-term growth rates, in order to calculate present value.
Segmental information IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Group Chief Executive and the Board to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
For management purposes effective from 1 July 2016, the Groups operating and reporting structure comprises three operating segments: Genus PIC, Genus ABS and Research and Development.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its segmental information.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows: Genus PIC our global porcine sales business: Genus ABS our global bovine sales business: and Research and Development our global spend on research and development.
A segment analysis of revenue, operating profit, depreciation, amortisation and non-current asset additions and segment assets and liabilities are detailed below.
We do not include our adjusting items in the segments, as we believe these do not reflect the underlying progress of the segments.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies, as described in the financial statements.

Exceptional items Accounting policy The Group presents exceptional items separately, as we believe it helps to improve the understanding of the Companys underlying performance.
In determining whether an item should be presented as exceptional, we consider items which are material either because of their size or their nature, and those which are non-recurring.
For an item to be considered as exceptional, it must initially meet at least one of the following criteria: it is a one-off material item: it is has been directly incurred as the result of either an acquisition and or integration or other major : it has been previously classified as an exceptional item, and as such consistent accounting treatment is being applied:or it is unusual in nature e. g. outside the normal course of business.
If an item meets at least one of the criteria, we then exercise judgement as to whether the item should be classified asexceptional.
The tax impact of the exceptional items is disclosed in note 11.
2017 2016 m m Operating expense income: Pension-related 5.7 44.2 Litigation 5.3 6.9 Acquisition and integration 0.6 0.2 Other including restructuring 2.3 0.8 2.5 36.3 | Genus plc Annual Report 2017 101 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2017 7.
Exceptional items continued Pension-related On 23 June 2017, National Milk Records plc 'NMR' withdrew from the MPF under a Flexible Apportionment Arrangement between NMR, Genus and the Trustees of the MPF.
In return for the right to withdraw from the MPF, NMR made a one-off, lump sum cash payment of 10.1m to the MPF, equivalent to the undiscounted value of all NMR's future payments under the existing MPF recovery plan which extends to March 2026: and NMR also made a payment to Genus of 4.7m, with 1.4m being satisfied by the issue NMR shares.
As a result of the NMR withdrawal, Genus has recognised 5.7m as an exceptional credit, with 4.5m 4.7m payment net of fees being received directly from NMR, and 1.2m from the MPF pension scheme reflecting the impact of NMR paying undiscounted amounts into the scheme.
See note 27 for further details.
During the prior year, a gain of 43.9m arose as a result of changing the index used for pensions and deferred pension increases in the MPF from RPI to CPI, and a 0.3m settlement gain arose from members leaving the samescheme.
Litigation Litigation includes legal fees of 5.3m 2016: 5.4m related to the action by ABS Global, Inc. ABS against Inguran, LLC aka Sexing Technologies ST and nil 2016: 1.5m US$2m for up-front damages related to patent infringement and confidential information.
On 14 July 2014, ABS launched a legal action against ST in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin alleging, among other matters, that ST: i has a monopoly in the processing of sexed bovine semen in the US: and ii unlawfully maintains this monopoly through anticompetitive conduct.
The legal action aimed to remove these barriers and allow free and fair competition in the sexed bovine semen processing market ABS Action.
In parallel with the ABSAction, ABS also filed Inter-Partes Review applications IPR before the US Patent Office challenging the validity of several of STs group patents, including US Patent No.
8,206,987 the 987 patent and US Patent No.
ST and its subsidiary XY Inc. filed an Answer and Counterclaim to the ABS Action, denying any anticompetitive activities, and alleging, among other matters, that the Company and ABS infringed the 920, 425, 987 and 092 patents.
On 29 April 2015, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB ruled that ABS had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on its assertion that relevant claims of the 987 patent were invalid and declined to order the institution of a trial.
However, trials were instituted for the other three patents.
On 11 January and 15 April 2016, the PTAB ruled that the 920 and 425 patents were unpatentable.
ST has appealed these decisions.
The parties await a decision from the PTAB on whether the 092 patent is unpatentable.
On 1 August 2016, the trial of the ABS Action commenced and lasted for approximately two weeks.
Following the jury verdicts, both sides filed post-trial motions.
On 31 March 2017, the Court entered a judgment which confirmed: i the Company and ABS had proved that ST had wilfully maintained a monopoly in the market for sexed bovine semen processing in the US since July 2012, and awarded a permanent injunction against ST which, among other matters, relieved ABS of certain research, marketing and other non-compete restrictions contained in the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties: ii ST's 987 and 092 patents were valid and infringed: and iii that ABS had materially breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement.
The Court also confirmed that: i the Company and ABS should pay ST an upfront amount of US$750,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$1.25 per straw on commercialisation of the Genus Sexed Semen technology for the use of ST's 987 patent in the US: ii the Company and ABS should pay ST an up front payment of US$500,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$0.50 per straw for the use of STs 092 patent in the US: and iii ABS should pay ST damages of US$750,000 for having breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement.
Both parties have appealed the Courts decision.
On 7 June 2017, ST, XY LLC and Cytonome ST, LLC filed proceedings against ABS Global, Inc. the Company and Premium Genetics UK Limited PG in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin New Litigation.
The New Litigation alleges that ABS and the Company infringe seven patents and asserts trade secret and breach of contract claims.
ABS, the Company and PG have filed a Motion to dismiss the trade secret and breach of contract claims.
The Company and ABS intend to vigorously defend the patent infringement claims.
Acquisitions and integration During the period, 0.6m of expenses were incurred, with 1.6m of expenses in relation to acquisitions and integration, principally of fide Novo Genetics and Hermitage Genetics, being partially offset by a gain on cancellation of the IVB putoption.
Other including restructuring Included within other of 2.3m is 1.8m restructuring costs primarily relating to ABS operating business, especially supply chain.

Taxation and deferred taxation This note explains how our Group tax charge arises.
The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets and liabilities held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of them in the future.
Accounting policies Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
We recognise tax in the income statement, unless: it relates to items we have recognised directly in equity, in which case we recognise it in equity: or it arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities in our financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating our taxable profit.
We account for deferred tax using the balance sheet liability method.
| 104 Genus plc Annual Report 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11.
Taxation and deferred taxation continued We generally recognise deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets to the extent that we will probably have taxable profits to utilise deductible temporary differences against.
We do not recognise these assets and liabilities if the temporary difference arises from: our initial recognition of goodwill: or our initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination that affects neither our taxable profit nor our accounting profit.
We recognise deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences arising on our investments in subsidiaries, and interests in joint ventures and associates, except where we can control the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
We calculate deferred tax at the tax rates we expect to apply in the period when we settle the liability or realise the asset.
We charge or credit deferred tax in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items we have charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.

Tax is calculated using prevailing tax legislation, reliefs, and existing interpretations and practice.
The Groups future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by factors such as countries reforming their tax legislation to implement the OECDs BEPS recommendations and by European Commission initiatives including state aid investigations.

We have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of 2.4m 2016: 2.5m of these benefits as we expect these losses to be offset against future profits of the relevant jurisdictions in the near term.
We have not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of the remaining 13.2m 2016: 12.7m, due to uncertainty about the availability of future taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions.

We have not recognised deferred tax liabilities totalling 4.5m 2016: 4.5m for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries.
This is because we can control the timing and reversal of these differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

This is subject to shareholders approval at the Annual General Meeting and we have therefore not included it as a liability in these financial statements.
Intangible assets Our Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill, acquired technology, customer relationships and our Genus Sexed Semen GSS development project.
We recognise that accounting for intangible assets is an area which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.
Accounting policies Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill When we acquire a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the goodwill arising is the excess of the acquisition cost, excluding transaction costs, over our interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Identifiable assets include intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are separable.
We state goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
We allocate goodwill to CGUs, which are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
We do not amortise goodwill but we do test it annually for impairment.
IAS 21 requires us to treat the following as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, rather than of the acquiring entity: goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation: and any fair value adjustments we make on acquisition to the carrying amounts of the acquirees assets and liabilities.
We therefore express them in the foreign operations functional currency and retranslate them at the balance sheet date.
| Genus plc Annual Report 2017 109 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2017 14.
Intangible assets continued Intangible assets Intangible assets that we have acquired in a business combination since 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised separately from goodwill, where they meet the definition of an intangible asset and we can reliably measure their fair values.
Their cost is their fair value at the acquisition date.
After their initial recognition, we report these intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
This is the same basis as for intangible assets acquired separately.
The estimated useful lives for intangible assets are as follows: Porcine and bovine genetics technology 20 years Multiplier contracts 15 years Customer relationships 10 to 17 years Genus sexed semen 10 years Patents and licences term of agreement 4 years Software 2 to 10 years Intangible assets acquired separately We carry intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.
We charge amortisation on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and review the useful life and amortisation method at the end of each financial year, accounting for the effect of any changes in estimate on a prospective basis.
Impairment We review the carrying amounts of our tangible and intangible assets at each balance sheet date, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any indication exists, we estimate the assets recoverable amount.
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, we estimate the recoverable amount at each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, we discount the estimated future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7% 2016: 10.8%, which is derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
For some countries we add a premium to this rate, to reflect the risk attributable to that country.
If the asset does not generate largely independent cash inflows, we determine the recoverable amount for the CGU that the asset belongs to.
We recognise an impairment loss in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
When we recognise an impairment loss in respect of a CGU, we first allocate it to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to CGUs, and then apply any remaining loss to reduce the carrying amount of the units other assets on a pro rata basis.
Reversals of impairment We reverse an impairment loss in respect of assets other than goodwill when the impairment loss may no longer exist and we have changed the estimates we used to determine the recoverable amount.
We only reverse an impairment loss to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount it would have had, net of depreciation or amortisation, if we had not recognised the impairment loss.

Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for CGUs containing goodwill To test impairment, we allocate goodwill to our CGUs which are in line with our operating segments.
These are the lowest level within the Group at which we monitor goodwill for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows: 2017 2016 m m Genus PIC 72.3 59.3 Genus ABS 32.4 26.7 104.7 86.0 We test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
We determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs by using value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations relate to discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices, direct costs and the cost saving derived from the GSS project.
We have estimated the pre-tax discount rate using the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC.
We risk adjusted the discount rate for risks specific to each market, adding between nil and 14% to the WACC as appropriate.
The post-tax WACC of 8.0% 2016: 8.0% we applied to our cash flow projections equates to a pre-tax rate of approximately 10.7% 2016: 10.8%.
Our estimates of changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and our expectations of future changes in the market.
The annual impairment test is performed immediately before year end.
It is based on cash flows derived from our most recent financial and strategic plans approved by management, cash flows beyond this period extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
Short-term profitability and growth rates are based on past experience, current trading conditions and our expectations of future changes in the market.
We have applied annual growth rates to cash flows in the five-year financial and strategic planning period.
A growth rate of 2.5% 2016: 2.5% has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond this period.
The Genus PIC and Genus ABS CGUs are deemed to be significant.
The individual country assumptions used to determine value in use for these CGUs are: Short-term growth rates Risk adjusted discount rate CAGR Long-term growth rates 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Genus PIC 822% 823% 624% 612% 2.5% 2.5% Genus ABS 822% 819% 126% 115% 2.5% 2.5% Weighted average Weighted average short-term growth rates risk adjusted discount rate CAGR 2017 2016 2017 2016 Genus PIC 9% 9% 11% 9% Genus ABS 9% 9% 8% 7% The rates towards the higher end of the range above represent those which are applied to our smaller entities and those in emerging markets and hence appear high relative to others.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Having completed our impairment review we have concluded that a reasonably possible change in any one key assumption does not result in an impairment in either PIC or ABS.
A combination of a 4% reduction in ABSs weighted average short-term growth rates combined with global macro-economic changes which caused both a 1% increase in post-tax WACC and a 1% reduction in long-term growth rates could result in goodwill impairment in the ABS CGU.
No reasonably possible combination of changes in key assumptions would result in impairment in the PIC CGU.

Biological assets The Group applies quantitative genetics and biotechnology to animal breeding.
We use these techniques to identify and select animals with the genes responsible for superior milk and meat, high health and performance traits.
We sell breeding animals and semen to customers, who use them to produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality, for the global dairy and meat supply chain.
We recognise that accounting for biological assets is an area which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.
Accounting policies Biological assets and inventories In bovine, we use research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, primarily the Holstein dairy breed.
Each selected bull has its performance measured against its peers, by using genomic evaluations and progeny testing of its daughters performance.
We collect and freeze semen from the best bulls, to satisfy our customers demand.
Farmers use semen from dairy breeds to breed replacement milking stock.
They use the semen we sell from beef breeds in either specialist beef breeding herds, for multiplying breeding bulls for use in natural service, or on dairy cows to produce animals to be reared for meat.
Our research and development also enables us to produce and select our own genetically superior females from which we will breed future bulls.
We hold our bovine biological assets for long-term internal use and classify them as non-current assets.
We transfer bull semen to inventory at its fair value at the point of harvest, which becomes its deemed cost under IAS 2.
We state our inventories at the lower of this deemed cost and net realisable value.
Sorting semen is a production process rather than a biological process.
As a result, we transfer semen inventory into sexed semen production at its fair value at the point of harvest, less the cost to sell, and it becomes a component of the production process.
We carry sexed semen in finished goods at production cost.
In porcine, we maintain and develop a central breeding stock the nucleus herd, to provide genetically superior animals.
These genetics help make farmers and food processors more profitable, by increasing their output of consistently high-quality products, which yield higher value.
So we can capitalise on our intellectual property, we outsource the vast majority of our pig production to our global multiplier network.
We also sell the offspring or semen we obtain from animals in the nucleus herd to customers for use in commercial farming.
Pig sales generally occur in one of two ways: upfront and royalty.
Under upfront sales, we receive the full fair value of the animal at the point we transfer it to the customer.
Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as comprising two separately identifiable components: its carcass and its genetic potential.
We receive the initial consideration, which is approximately the animals carcass value, at the point we transfer the pig to the customer.
We retain our interest in the pigs genetic potential and receive royalties for the customers use of this genetic potential.
The breeding animal biological assets we own, and our retained interest in the biological assets we have sold under royalty contracts, are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
We recognise changes in fair value in the income statement, within operating profit for the period.
We classify the porcine biological assets we are using as breeding animals, as non-current assets and carry them at fair value.
The porcine biological assets we are holding for resale, which are the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair value and classified as current assets.
We split our retained interest in the genetics from royalty sales between current and non-current assets, based on the expected remaining life of the animals.
Determination of fair values biological assets IAS 41 Agriculture requires us to show the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet.
We determine this carrying value according to IAS 41s provisions and show the net valuation movement in the income statement.
There are important differences in how we value our bovine and porcine assets, as explained below.
Bovine we base the fair value of proven bulls, bulls with a genomic evaluation and bulls on test, on the net cash flows we expect to receive from selling their semen, discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate.
Proven bulls are those we have evaluated through daughter proofs and whose semen we actively market.
Genomic bulls are those we market on their estimated genetic value.
We adjust the fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory we manage where a third party has a share in semen sales from a particular bull.
The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, estimated production value, each bulls expected marketable life and, for bulls on test, the percentage whose production we expect to actively market.
In assessing the sales price, we use independent statistical data for the bulls.
This data is produced three times a year in all our major markets.
In addition, we estimate which markets we will sell the semen in, as well as domestic and export prices.
Females are valued by reference to market prices and published independent genetic evaluations.
Porcine the fair value of porcine biological assets includes the animals we own entirely and our retained interest in the genetics of animals we have sold under royalty arrangements.
The fair value of animals we own is calculated using the animals average live weights, plus a premium where we believe that their genetics make them saleable.
We base the live weight value and the genetic premium on recent transaction prices we have achieved.
The significant assumptions in determining fair values are the breeding animals expected life, the percentage of production animals that are saleable as breeding animals, and the expected sales prices.
For our retained interest in the genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts, we base the initial fair value on the fair values we achieved in recent direct sales of similar animals, less the amount we received upfront for the carcass element.
We then remeasure the fair value of our retained interest at each reporting date.
The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained interest is the animals expected life.
| Genus plc Annual Report 2017 113 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2017 15.
Biological assets continued We value the pigs in our pure line herds, which are the repository of our proprietary genetics, as a single unit of account.
We do this using a discounted cash flow model, applied to the herds future outputs at current prices.
The significant assumptions we make are the number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices we achieve on sales, the animals expected useful lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate.
Non-recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group To manage commercial risk, a very large part of our porcine business model involves selling pigs to farmers multipliers who produce piglets on farms we neither manage nor control.
We have the option, but not the obligation, to buy the offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium.
Because the offspring have superior genetics, we can then sell them to other farmers at a premium.
We do not recognise the right to purchase offspring on the balance sheet, as we enter into the contracts and continue to hold them for the purpose of receiving non-financial items the offspring, in accordance with our expected purchase requirements.
This means the option is outside the scope of IAS 39.
We do not recognise the offspring as biological assets under IAS 41, as we do not own or control them.

There are no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes during the year.
The current market-determined post-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull semen is the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets.
Inventories of such semen are shown as biological asset harvest in note 19.

For pure line porcine herds, the net cash flows from the herds expected output are discounted at the Groups required rate of return, adjusted for the greater risk implicit in including output from future generations.
This adjusted rate has been assessed as 11.0% 2016: 11.0%.

Property, plant and equipment We make significant investments in our property, plant and equipment.
All assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Accounting policies We state property, plant and equipment at cost, together with any directly attributable acquisition expenses, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, we account for them separately.
We charge depreciation to the income statement on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of each part of an asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 10 to 40 years Leasehold buildings over the term of the lease Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years We do not depreciate land or assets under construction.

Equity-accounted investees We hold interests in several joint ventures and associates where we have significant influence.
Accounting policies Joint ventures are entities over whose activities we have joint control, under a contractual agreement.
The Group financial statements include the Groups share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The Group financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity-accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date it ceases.
When our share of losses exceeds our interest in an associate, we reduce the carrying amount to nil and stop recognising further losses, except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on an associates behalf.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures or associates are initially recognised in the Group Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the joint ventures and associates.
Related party transactions with the Groups joint ventures and associates primarily comprise product and services.
As each arrangement is a separate legal entity and control rights are substantially equal with the other parties, there are no significant judgements required to be made.
The Groups share of profit after tax in its equity-accounted investees for the year was 6.2m 2016: 6.9m.

Provisions A provision is a liability recorded in the balance sheet, where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore estimated.
The main provisions we hold are in relation to contingent deferred consideration.
Accounting policies We recognise a provision in the balance sheet when an event results in the Group having a current legal or constructive obligation, and it is probable that we will have to settle the obligation through an outflow of economic benefits.
If the effect is material, we discount provisions to their present value.

Other provisions mainly relate to legal 1.0m and restructuring 0.2m provisions.
The timing and cash flows associated with the restructuring costs and a majority of legal claims are expected to be less than one year.
However, for some legal claims the timing of cash flows may be long-term in nature.
The property provision mainly represents the discounted future costs of dilapidations.
Financial instruments This note details our treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as the Groups exposure and sensitivity to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange rate risk, and the policies in place to monitor and manage these risks.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, coordinates our access to domestic and international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Groups operations, through internal risk reports that analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks.
These risks include market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
We seek to minimise the effects of these risks by hedging them using derivative financial instruments.
Our use of financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
The Board of Directors regularly reviews our compliance with policies and exposure limits.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.
Financial risk The principal financial risks our activities expose us to are the risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price risks, including: forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods and purchase of supplies in foreign currencies: interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates: and forward commodity contracts, to hedge commodity price risk.
| Genus plc Annual Report 2017 123 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2017 24.
Financial instruments continued Accounting policies Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the instruments contractual provisions.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Put option arrangements over non-controlling interest The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as financial liabilities, when such options may only be settled by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of shares in the subsidiary.
The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value within borrowings, with a corresponding charge directly to equity.
The charge to equity is recognised separately as written put options over non-controlling interest, adjacent to non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries.
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable.
The charge arising is recorded as a financing cost.
If the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the Group Income Statement.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, we recycle in the Group Income Statement the associated gains and losses that we had recognised in equity.
We do this in the same period or periods that the asset or liability affects the Group Income Statement, which are the periods when we recognise the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or exercised, or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If we no longer expect the hedged transaction to take place, we immediately recognise in the Group Income Statement the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
Net investment hedges Where we have designated a derivative financial instrument as hedging the variability of the net assets of an overseas subsidiary, which arises from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the subsidiarys functional currency, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We only apply net investment hedge accounting in the Group financial statements.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that Group entities can continue as a going concern, while maximising the return to shareholders by optimising our debt and equity balance.
The Groups capital structure consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 25, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 29.
| 124 Genus plc Annual Report 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24.
Financial instruments continued Gearing ratio The Group keeps its capital structure under review and monitors it monthly to ensure the gearing ratio remains below60%.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The gearing ratio at the year end was asfollows: 2017 2016 m m Debt see note 25 138.1 123.7 Cash and cash equivalents see note 21 26.5 34.0 Net debt see note 30 111.6 89.7 Equity 402.1 368.1 Net debt to equity ratio 28% 24% Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 25.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Parent.
Categories of financial instruments We have categorised financial instruments held at valuation into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 13.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, we base the category level on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
We have estimated the fair values of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 13.
We have not categorised any financial instruments as Level 1 or Level 3.

Financial instruments continued Foreign currency income statement sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to movements in the US Dollar, Euro, Brazilian Real, Mexican Peso and Chinese Yuan Renminbi exchange rates.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against these currencies.
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management and represents our assessment of a significant change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
It includes external loans, as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the loan is denominated in a currency other than the lender or borrowers currency.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit when Sterling weakens against the relevant currency.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as Group entities borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
We manage this risk centrally, by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, using interest rate swaps.
We regularly review our hedging activities, to align with our interest rate views and defined risk appetite, thereby ensuring we apply optimal hedging strategies to minimise the adverse impact of fluctuations in interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis We have determined the sensitivity analyses below, based on the Groups exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments, at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, we prepared the analysis assuming the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is usedwhen reporting interest rate risk internally to key management and is our assessment of a significant change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 30 June 2017 would have decreased or increased by 0.5m 2016: decrease increase by 0.5m.
This impact is smaller than would otherwise be the case, due to our fixed rate hedging.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts, calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
These contracts enable us to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the variable rate debt we hold.
We determine the fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date by discounting the future cash flows, using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
This fair value is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
Cash flow hedges The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Outstanding receive floating pay fixed contracts % % m m m m USD interest rate swaps Within one year 0.68 15.0 0.3 Two to five years 1.10 1.10 84.7 82.3 1.2 0.4 GBP interest rate swaps Two to five years 0.51 20.0 0.1 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is threemonth LIBOR.
We settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts that exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges, to reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and we recognise the amount deferred in equity in profit or loss, over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.
Commodity hedges The Group hedges both feed and slaughter exposures by using the Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog, corn and soybean meal commodity futures.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
We have a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
We regularly monitor our exposure and the credit ratings of our counterparties, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that the Board reviews and approves annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
We carry out ongoing credit evaluation of the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk.
We manage this risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables For non-derivative financial liabilities, see notes 25 and 26.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade payables and other creditors.
We have drawn up the table based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, using the earliest date on which we can be required to pay.

Loans and borrowings The Groups borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes comes from a range of committed bank facilities.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings We initially recognise interest-bearing loans and borrowings at their fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
After this initial recognition, we state them at amortised cost and recognise any difference between the cost and redemption value in the income statement over the borrowings expected life, on an effective interest rate basis.

At the balance sheet date, the Groups credit facilities comprised a 75m multi-currency revolving credit facility and a US$165m revolving creditfacility.
As part of its interest rate strategy, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge floating LIBOR rates.
As a result, bank loan and overdrafts include borrowings of US$110m 84.7m fixed at 1.10% and GBP 20m fixed at 0.51%, excluding applicable bank margin.

Finance lease liabilities A finance lease is a commitment to make a payment in the future, primarily in relation to plant and machinery and motorvehicles.
Accounting policies We classify leases as finance leases whenever the lease terms transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to us.
All other leases are operating leases.
We recognise the assets we hold under finance leases at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each of which we determine at the start of the lease.
We include our corresponding liability in the balance sheet, as a finance lease obligation.
We apportion lease payments between finance charges and a reduction in our lease obligation, so we achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining liability.
We recognise finance charges directly in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case we capitalise them in accordance with our general policy on borrowing costs.
Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows: Minimum Minimum lease lease payments Interest Principal payments Interest Principal 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 m m m m m m Less than one year 1.4 0.1 1.5 1.1 1.1 Between one and five years 1.8 0.1 1.9 2.7 0.2 2.9 3.2 0.2 3.4 3.8 0.2 4.0 Finance lease liabilities are secured on the assets to which they relate.
There are no other restrictions imposed by the lessor.
The fair value of the leases is approximately equal to the carrying amount.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees.
The principal funds are the Milk Pension Fund MPF and the Dalgety Pension Fund DPF in the UK, which are defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these funds are held separately from the Groups assets and are administered by Trustees and managed professionally.
We recognise that accounting for retirement benefit obligations is an area which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.
Accounting policies Defined contribution pension schemes A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
We charge contributions to the income statement as they become payable under the scheme rules.
We show differences between the contributions payable and the amount we have paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The schemes assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees.
These schemes are closed to new members and to further accrual.
We calculate our net obligation separately for each scheme, by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned, in return for their service to date.
We discount that benefit to determine its present value, and deduct the fair value of the plans assets at bid price.
The liability discount rate we use is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, with terms to maturity approximating our pension liabilities.
Qualified actuaries perform the calculations, using the projected unit method.
We recognise actuarial gains and losses in equity in the period in which they occur, through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets and experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities.
Genus and the other participating employers are jointly and severally liable for the MPF defined benefit schemes obligations.
We account for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, and provide for any amounts we believe we will have to pay under our joint and several liability.
The joint and several liability also means we have a contingent liability for the schemes obligations that we have not accounted for.
Under the joint and several liability, we initially recognise any changes in our share of orphan assets and liabilities in the income statement.
After this initial recognition, any actuarial gains and losses on the orphan assets and liabilities are recognised directly in equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in the period in which they occur.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Retirement benefit obligations The financial positions of the defined benefit schemes as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, are aggregated for disclosure purposes.
The liability split by principal scheme is set out below.
2017 2016 m m The MPF Genuss share 30.4 34.3 The Dalgety Pension Fund Other retirement benefit obligations and other unfunded schemes 10.5 10.2 Overall net pension liability 40.9 44.5 Overall, we expect to pay 7.3m 2017: 7.1m in contributions to defined benefit plans in the 2018 financial year.
The defined benefit plans are administered by Trustee boards that are legally separated from the Group.
The Trustee board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company.
The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution policies, and for the governance of the fund.
The defined benefit pension schemes exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as greater than expected longevity of members, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the plans liabilities or reduce the value of their assets.
UK pensions are regulated by The Pensions Regulator, a non-departmental public body established under the Pensions Act 2004 and sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, operating within a legal regulatory framework set by the UK Parliament.
The Pensions Regulator has statutory objectives set out in legislation, which include promoting and improving understanding of the good administration of work-based pensions, protecting member benefits and regulating occupational defined benefit and contribution schemes.
The Pensions Regulators statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website at thepensionsregulator.
All defined benefit schemes are registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and are subject to UK legislation and oversight from The Pensions Regulator.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and valued at least every three years.
Separate valuations are required for each scheme.
Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan trustees and the Group must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure.
Funding plans are individually agreed with the respective trustees for each of the Groups defined benefits pension schemes, taking into account local regulatory requirements.
The MPF The MPF was previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board and was also open to staff working for Milk Marque Ltd the principal employer, now known as Community Foods Group Limited, NMR, First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd which went into receivership in June 2009 and Milk Link Ltd. We have accounted for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, which together represent approximately 85% of the MPF 2016: 75%.
Although the MPF is managed on a sectionalised basis, it is a last man standing scheme, which means that all participating employers are jointly and severally liable for all of the funds liabilities.
With effect from 30 June 2013, Genuss remaining active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became deferred pensioners.
On 11 January 2016, the Trustees of the MPF agreed with a request from the employers to change the index used for pension and deferred pension increases from RPI to CPI.
The members of the scheme were informed of this change on 17 February 2016, which is effective for increases starting in 2016.
As a result of the change, Genus recorded a gain of 43.9m.
The most recent actuarial triennial valuation of the MPF was at 31 March 2015 and was carried out by qualified actuaries.
The valuation has been agreed by the Trustees.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2015 valuation were that: investment returns on existing assets would exceed fixed interest gilt yields by 1.1% p. a. : CPI price inflation is expected to be 0.9% p. a. lower than RPI price inflation: and pensions in payment and pensions in deferment would increase in future in line with CPI price inflation, subject to various minimum and maximum increases.
At 31 March 2015, the market value of the funds assets was 403m.
This represented approximately 87% of the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were 465m at that date.
| Genus plc Annual Report 2017 131 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2017 27.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2015 valuation, was 62m of which Genuss notional share was 47m.
This shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers.
Under the Trustee prepared schedule of contributions, Genus will be required to make deficit repair contributions of 5.6m p. a. commencing 31 March 2016, and rising thereafter by 3.4% p. a. until 31 August 2022, in addition to funding the schemes operating expenses.
Genus has assessed its additional pension liability under IFRIC 14 by reference to this schedule of contributions, resulting in an amount of 19.6m 2016: 14.9m being recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
On 23 June 2017, NMR withdrew from the MPF under a Flexible Apportionment Arrangement between NMR, Genus and the Trustees of the MPF.
In return for the right to withdraw from the MPF, NMR made a one-off, lump sum cash payment of 10.1m to the MPF, equivalent to the undiscounted value of all NMRs future payments under the existing MPF recovery plan which extends to March 2026: and NMR also made a payment to Genus of 4.7m, with 1.4m being satisfied by the issue NMR shares.
As a result of the NMR withdrawal, Genus has recognised 5.7m as an exceptional credit, with 4.5m 4.7m payment net of fees being received directly from NMR, and 1.2m from MPF pension scheme reflecting the impact of NMR paying undiscounted amounts into the scheme.
The DPF The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPF was at 31 March 2015 and carried out by qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2015 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would be 4.1% p. a. before retirement and 2.2% p. a. after retirement and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would be 3.3% p. a.
The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2015 was 31.6m.
The value of those assets represented approximately 101% of the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were 31.3m at 31 March 2015.
Under the funding agreement, the Company will not have to make deficit repair contributions.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate calculations carried out as at 31 March 2015 and updated to 30 June 2016.
As at 30 June 2017 the DPF was in an overall net pension asset position of 6.5m.
However, the Company does not have the unilateral right to this surplus and therefore in line with IFRIC 14 the recognition of this asset is restricted.
The Trustees of the DPF hold an 18.7m reserve against future unknown liabilities materialising.
As the economic benefit to Genus of this amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
In addition to the aggregate assets and liabilities disclosed, a bulk annuity policy was secured with an insurance company in July 1999, which matched the benefit entitlement of the almost all of the funds current and deferred pension liabilities at that time.
The value of these policies and related liabilities at 30 June 2017 was 708m 2016: 703m.
Other defined benefit scheme in deficit The Group operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig Development Company Limited.
The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2017, under the provisions of IAS 19, were 5.2m 2016:5.2m and 6.7m 2016:6.5m, respectively.
Other unfunded schemes When the Group acquired Sygen International plc, it also acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous Groups senior employees and executives.
The scheme liabilities for the three unfunded defined benefit schemes amounted to 8.1m 2016: 8.0m, based on IAS 19s methods and assumptions.
This amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group Balance Sheet.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities amounted to 0.2m 2016: 0.2m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 2.65% 2016: 2.8% and that inflation and pension payment increases would be 3.1% per annum 2016: 2.7%.
The scheme liabilities for the unfunded retirement health benefit plan amounted to 0.9m 2016: 0.9m, based on IAS 19s methods and assumptions.
This amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Group Balance Sheet.
Interest on plan liabilities amounted to nil 2016: 0.1m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 2.65% 2016: 2.8% and that the long-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 7.1% 2016: 6.7%.

2017 2016 Years Years Retiring at balance sheet date at age 65 Male 23.0 22.9 Female 25.2 25.1 Retiring at age 65 in 20 years time Male 24.7 24.6 Female 27.0 26.9 Duration of benefit obligations The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 30 June 2017 was 17.4 years 2016: 17.5 years.
Sensitivity analysis Measurement of the Groups defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2017.
Discount rate Rate of inflation Life expectancy Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase by 0.25% by 0.25% by 0.25% by 0.25% by 1 year by 1year m m m m m m Increase decrease in present value of defined obligation 16.9 16.2 11.9 12.1 16.9 16.9 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation, as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation from one another.
The sensitivities assume the funds assets remain unchanged.
However, in practice changes in interest rates and inflation will also affect the value of the funds assets.
The funds investment strategy aims to hold matching assets which should move broadly in line with the liabilities of the funds, to protect partially against changes in interest rates and inflation.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared using the same method adopted when adjusting results of the latest funding valuation to the balance sheet date.
This is the same approach adopted in previous periods.
The history of experience adjustment is as follows: 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 m m m m m Present value of the defined benefit obligation 433.2 356.8 386.1 367.8 355.2 Fair value of plan assets 418.4 334.0 329.2 314.6 294.1 Restrict recognition of asset and recognition of additional liability 26.1 21.7 6.2 5.0 3.9 Deficit in the plans 40.9 44.5 63.1 58.2 65.0 Experience adjustments arising on plan liabilities % 7.1 5.3 4.9 2.9 5.1 Experience adjustments arising on plan assets % 7.6 4.1 3.7 4.9 2.5 | Genus plc Annual Report 2017 135 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2017 28.
Share-based payments We have a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and senior management as part of their remuneration.
To record the cost of these, a charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement, based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant.
Accounting policies We recognise the fair value of share awards and options granted as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
We measure the fair value at the grant date and spread it over the vesting period of each option.
We use a binomial valuation model to measure the fair value of options and a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure the fair value of share awards.
We adjust the amount we recognise as an expense, to reflect the estimated performance against non-market related conditions and the number of share awards and options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
The Group recognised a total share-based payment expense of 4.6m 2016: 3.8m, including National Insurance contributions of 1.0m 2016: 0.4m.
Share awards There were 1,089,391 conditional share awards outstanding at 30 June 2017.
These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the 2004 Performance Share Plan on 7 December 2012, 26 September 2013 and 14 March 2014, and under the 2014 Performance Share Plan on 20 November 2014, 14 September 2015 and 14 September 2016.
In accordance with the plans terms, participants have received a conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option awards which will normally vest after three years, with the proportion of the award vesting depending on growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share.
Further details of the plans performance conditions are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In the year ended 30 June 2017, awards were granted on 14 September 2016, with an aggregate fair value of 5,725,000.
The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is based on the fair value of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
At the date of grant, the fair value of a share awarded was 18.78, based on an expected dividend yield of 1.21%.

Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from translating the financial statements of our foreign operations.
The Group uses foreign currency denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Groups net investment in overseas companies.
Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies caused by changes in exchange rates, the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve.
The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments, net of taxation.
