The financial statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds million, except when otherwise indicated.
See note 1 for general information about the Company.

Significant accounting policies in this section Investment in subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
In testing for impairment, the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its value-in-use.
Share based payments The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
The subsidiary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution from the Company.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section Impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiaries assets based on value-in-use calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 14 of the Group financial statements.

Interest on these borrowings in the year amounted to nil 2016: nil and the Directors do not perceive that servicing this debt poses any significant risk to the Company given its size in relation to the Companys net assets.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures required a market risk sensitivity analysis illustrating the fair values of the Companys financial instruments and the impact on the Companys income statement and shareholders equity of reasonably possible changes in selected market risks.
Excluding cash and cash equivalents, the Company has no financial assets or liabilities that expose it to market risk, other than the amounts owed by to subsidiary undertakings of 122.0 million 2016: 80.8 million and 2.4 million 2016: 2.3 million respectively.
The Directors do not believe that a change of 25 basis points in the LIBOR interest rates will have a material impact on the Companys income statement or shareholders equity.
Contingent liabilities Lease arrangements with a consortium of investors The Company has given a guarantee to a consortium of investors, comprising Malaysias Employees Provident Fund EPF, affiliated funds of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group and Moor Park Capital, in relation to the sale of 12 of the Spire Groups property-owning companies on 17 January 2013.
With effect from 17 January 2013, the total third party annual commitments of the Group under these operating leases increased by 51.3 million per annum.
As a result of the sale, the Group has long-term institutional lease arrangements up to December 2042, subject to renewal or extension, with the landlord for each of the 12 properties.
The leases include key terms such as annual rental covenants and minimum levels of capital expenditure invested by the Group.

If the minimum rent cover ratio is not met, the Group is required to enter into an asset performance recovery plan in order to comply with the covenants, but no default would be deemed to have occurred.
The Company is a party to this guarantee.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group complied with the required covenants.

The initial rentals payable under the leases in 2010 were 6.3 million per annum, which will be subject to an increase in future years.
As part of these arrangements, the assets of the Company are subject to a fixed and floating charge in the event of a default.
As at 31 December 2017, there was no breach in the required covenants.
