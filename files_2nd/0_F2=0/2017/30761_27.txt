The additional accounting policies that are specific to the separate financial statements of the Company are set out below.
Investment in subsidiaries The Company accounts for its investments in directly owned subsidiaries as available for sale financial assets, which are included in the accounts at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of the investments in subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity in the statement of comprehensive income.

Dividend income Dividend income from investments in subsidiaries is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
New accounting standards, interpretations and amendments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments has been issued to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and primarily changes the classification and measurement of financial assets, depending on the business model under which they are held, as well as hedge accounting requirements and recognising expected credit losses.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the Company from that date.

The Companys investments are classified as level 2 financial assets.
Fair value of the Companys significant subsidiary is determined by reference to the market value derived from relevant indices of the Companys ordinary shares and loan capital instruments at the end of the reporting period, being the most transparent independent available indicator.
The market value is adjusted for the fair value of the Companys preference shares, assets and liabilities, excluding directly owned subsidiaries.
The adjusting items have been fair valued by determining the present value of future cash flow projections, using an appropriate arms length discount rate.
The remaining subsidiaries are held at fair value which has been determined to be net asset value.
The subordinated loan to a subsidiary has the same terms as the external loan capital from which the loan to the subsidiary was financed.
The fair value of the loan is based on the quoted prices for the external loan capital.
The nominal value of the loan is 32m 2016: 292m with an interest rate of 9.375%.
During the year the outstanding value of a further loan to a subsidiary was repaid, this had a nominal value at 31 December 2016 of 78m.
The Directors believe that the methodology used supports the inclusion of the investments in subsidiaries in the statement of financial position, at the fair values ascribed to them.
The market value of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2017 was 632.5p.
A movement of 1% in the share price would have an impact of 65m on the fair value.
Full details of the principal subsidiaries of the Company are set out in Appendix B to the consolidated financial statements.
