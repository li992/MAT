The following new and amended standards will be adopted by the Group from 1 January 2018 and will not impact the consolidated financial statements of the Group: Amendments to IFRS 1: First time adoption of IFRS regarding IFRS 7, IAS 19 and IFRS 10 Amendments to IAS 28: Investment in associates and joint ventures IFRIC 22: Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 107 Section 2: Segment information Operating segments The Group considers that operating segments presented on a products and services basis are the most appropriate way to demonstrate the performance of the Group.
This is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, together the chief operating decision maker CODM, and reflects the way in which resources are allocated.
The CODM considers there to be two operating segments: Events which provide face-to-face interaction in the form of exhibitions, tradeshows, conferences and other live events: and Other Marketing Services which publish magazines and trade press to specialist markets either online or in print: as well as providing sponsorships and banner advertising and online directory and data products: The PR Newswire businesses which were disposed in June 2016 comprised the previously reported PR Newswire operating segment and have been reported as discontinued operations as at 31 December 2016.
Segment measures The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments and the allocation of resources using revenue and adjusted operating profit.
Adjusted operating profit is IFRS operating profit excluding amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, exceptional items and share of tax on results of joint ventures and associates.
Finance income expense and tax are not allocated to operating segments and are reported to the CODM only in aggregate.
Segment assets and liabilities are not reported to the CODM.
Transactions between segments are measured on the basis of prices that would apply to third-party transactions.

3.6 Tax This note details the accounting policies applied for tax, the current and deferred tax charges or credits in the year, a reconciliation of total tax expense to the accounting profit and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policy Current tax for the current and prior periods is recognised, to the extent unpaid, as a liability at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax liabilities are measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences arising from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Current tax expense and deferred tax expense are recognised in the income statement except to the extent they arise from a transaction or event recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Any such tax expense is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.
The Group is a multi-national group with tax liabilities arising in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to complexity in the Groups tax structure.
Therefore the calculation of the Groups current tax liabilities and tax expense necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
The tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements are measured at the Directors estimate of tax that may become payable.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period identified.

These have been recognised because the Group expects to generate taxable profits in the future against which these will be used.
The Group has the following unused tax losses for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised: 329.5m 2016: 321.8m in UK subsidiaries which are available to offset against future UK corporate tax liabilities: 115.7m 2016: 189.2m in US subsidiaries which are available to offset against future US federal tax liabilities.
In addition, there are unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of US State losses of 15.2m 2016: 18.4m : 251.6m 2016: 249.7m of UK capital losses which are only available for offset against future capital gains: 7.5bn 2016: 7.2bn that have arisen in Luxembourg holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes: and 20.1m 2016: 7.4m in respect of companies in other countries.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of any of these amounts as it is uncertain that these losses will be utilised.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in relation to other deductible temporary differences of 15.8m 2.3m in relation to the UK, 7.5m in relation to the US, and 6.0m in relation to other countries 2016: 20.7m 13.6m, nil and 7.1m respectively.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect these assets as it is uncertain that they will be utilised.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 114 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 3.6 Tax continued At 31 December 2017, deferred tax liabilities of 4.5m 2016: 3.9m have been recognised for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries.
No other deferred tax liabilities have been recognised as the Group has determined that profits of subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to 5.2bn 2016: 5.0bn.
3.7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share excludes amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, movements on deferred tax balances recognised as a consequence of acquisition of intangibles, exceptional items and net financing expense adjustments detailed in Note 5.4.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The impact of dilutive securities in 2017 would be to increase weighted average shares by 4.0 million shares 2016: 4.3 million shares.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2016 reflects the share consolidation on 27 June 2016 of eight for every nine shares owned.
In accordance with IAS 33, the prior period weighted average number of shares has not been restated as the share consolidation was coupled with the payment of the special dividend Note 5.8, which had the overall effect of a share repurchase at fair value.
The weighted average number of shares excludes ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan the ESOP.
Continuing operations Weighted Weighted average no.
