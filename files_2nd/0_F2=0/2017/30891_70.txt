Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension benefit payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-retirement benefits within Note 1.
The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The UK plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
In the US, all employees now accrue benefits under a cash balance formula.
Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected.
Retiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement.
The plan is funded and its assets are overseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee composed of six BP employees appointed by the president of BP Corporation North America Inc. the appointing officer.
The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan.
US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution 401k plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
In the US, group companies also provide post-retirement healthcare to retired employees and their dependants and, in certain cases, life insurance coverage : the entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion of a minimum period of service.
In the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries.
In Germany and France, the majority of the pensions are unfunded, in line with market practice.
In Germany, the groups largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core pension through salary sacrifice.
For employees who joined since 2002 the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on such factors as an employees pensionable salary and length of service.
The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and employees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law.
Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of an annuity.
The German plans are governed by legal agreements between BP and the works council or between BP and the trade union.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2017 the aggregate level of contributions was $637 million 2016 $651 million and 2015 $1,066 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2018 is expected to be approximately $600 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions is agreed.
The current agreement covers the next five years.
The funding agreement can be terminated unilaterally by either party with two years notice.
Contractually committed funding therefore represents seven years of future contributions, which amounted to $2,623 million at 31December2017, of which $106 million relates to past service.
This amount is included in the groups committed cash flows relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefit plans as set out in the table of contractual obligations on page 252.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
Pension contributions in the US are determined by legislation and are supplemented by discretionary contributions.
All of the contributions made into the US pension plan in 2017 were discretionary and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.
There was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31December2017.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31December2017.
The UK plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years: valuations are required more frequently in many other countries.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31December2014, and a valuation as at 31December2017 is currently under way.
A valuation of the US plan is carried out annually.
The material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31December and pension expense for the following year.
% Financial assumptions used to determine benefit UK US Eurozone obligation 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Discount rate for plan liabilities 2.5 2.7 3.9 3.5 3.9 4.0 1.9 1.7 2.4 Rate of increase in salaries 4.1 4.6 4.4 4.1 4.2 3.9 3.0 3.0 3.2 Rate of increase for pensions in 2.9 3.0 3.0 1.4 1.5 1.6 payment Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.9 3.0 3.0 0.6 0.5 0.6 Inflation for plan liabilities 3.1 3.2 3.0 1.7 1.8 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.8 % Financial assumptions used to determine benefit UK US Eurozone expense 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Discount rate for plan service cost 2.7 4.0 3.9 4.1 4.2 3.8 2.1 2.7 2.3 Discount rate for plan other finance 2.7 3.9 3.6 3.9 4.0 3.7 1.7 2.4 2.0 expense Inflation for plan service cost 3.2 3.1 3.1 1.8 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.8 2.0 The discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and for our largest plans in the UK, US and the Eurozone we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information available.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
The assumptions for the rate of increase in salaries are based on the inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
These include an allowance for promotion-related salary growth, of up to 0.8% depending on country.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions, and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
BPs most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows: Years Mortality assumptions UK US Eurozone 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.4 28.0 28.5 25.1 25.7 25.7 25.1 25.0 24.9 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 29.0 30.0 31.0 26.8 27.5 27.5 27.6 27.6 27.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 28.8 29.5 29.5 28.4 29.3 29.2 29.0 28.9 28.8 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 30.5 31.9 31.9 30.0 31.0 30.9 31.4 31.3 31.2 Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The trustees long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk.
To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment LDI approach for part of the portfolio, investing in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate.
This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date.
The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities.
The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued For the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets included in the LDI portfolio over time by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds.
There is a similar agreement in place for the primary US plan.
During 2017, the UK and the US plans switched 15% and 5% of plan assets respectively from equities to bonds.
The current asset allocation policy for the major plans at 31December2017 was as follows: UK US Asset category % % Total equity including private equity 43 50 Bonds cash including LDI 50 50 Property real estate 7 The amounts invested under the LDI programme by the primary UK pension plan as at 31December2017 were $2,588 million 2016 $423 million of government-issued nominal bonds and $16,177 million 2016 $9,384 million of index-linked bonds.
In addition, the primary UK plan entered into interest rate swaps in the year to offset the long-term fixed interest rate exposure for $1,333 million 2016 $4,450 million of the corporate bond portfolio.
At 31December2017 the fair value liability of these swaps was $49 million 2016 $144 million fair value liability and is included in other assets in the table below.
Some of the groups pension plans in other countries also use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level of risk.
The groups main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
The fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments.
Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 165.
Property held by the UK pension plans is in the United Kingdom.
b Bonds held by the US pension plans are denominated in US dollars.
c Private equity is valued at fair value based on the most recent third-party net asset valuation.
d Properties are valued based on an analysis of recent market transactions supported by market knowledge derived from third-party valuers.

Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, inflation, salary growth and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
A onepercentage point change, in isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31December2017 for the groups plans would have had the effects shown in the table below.
The effects shown for the expense in 2018 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.
$ million One percentage point Increase Decrease a Discount rate Effect on pension and other post-retirement benefit expense in 2018 366 298 Effect on pension and other post-retirement benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 7,532 9,751 b Inflation rate Effect on pension and other post-retirement benefit expense in 2018 241 200 Effect on pension and other post-retirement benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 5,373 4,690 Salary growth Effect on pension and other post-retirement benefit expense in 2018 78 68 Effect on pension and other post-retirement benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 837 747 a The amounts presented reflect that the discount rate is used to determine the asset interest income as well as the interest cost on the obligation.
b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in salaries, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.
One additional year of longevity in the mortality assumptions would increase the 2018 pension and other post-retirement benefit expense by $56 million and the pension and other post-retirement benefit obligation at 31December2017 by $1,694 million.
