 UNAUDITED Our revenues from the sale of passenger tickets are seasonal.
Historically, demand for cruises has been greatest during our third quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months.
This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher ticket prices and occupancy levels and, accordingly, the largest share of our operating income is earned during this period.
The seasonality of our results also increases due to ships being taken out-of-service for maintenance, which we schedule during non-peak demand periods.
In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours revenue and net income is generated from May through September in conjunction with the Alaska cruise season.
The quarterly data below, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the unaudited interim periods.
