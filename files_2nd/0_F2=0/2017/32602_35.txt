c. Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, can be utilised.
166 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC 168 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued c. Deferred tax continued The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
d. Share-based payments The Company provides benefits to employees including Directors of Saga plc and its subsidiary undertakings, in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value on the grant date and is recognised as an expense over the relevant vesting period, ending on the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award.
Fair values of share-based payment transactions are calculated using Black-Scholes modelling techniques.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, assessment is made of any vesting conditions to categorise these into market performance conditions, non-market performance conditions and service conditions.
Where the equity-settled transactions have market performance conditions that is, performance which is directly or indirectly linked to the share price, the fair value of the award is assessed at the time of grant and is not changed, regardless of the actual level of vesting achieved, except where the employee ceases to be employed prior to the vesting date.
For service conditions and non-market performance conditions, the fair value of the award is assessed at the time of grant and is reassessed at each reporting date to reflect updated expectations for the level of vesting.
No expense is recognised for awards that ultimately do not vest.
At each reporting date prior to vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and, in the case of non-market conditions, the best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of instruments subject to market conditions, the fair value on grant adjusted only for leavers.
The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the income statement, with the corresponding increase in share-based payments reserve.
Upon vesting of an equity instrument, the cumulative cost in the share-based payments reserve is reclassified to reserves.
