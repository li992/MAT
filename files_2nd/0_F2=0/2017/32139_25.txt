AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 82 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 123.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 Key accounting policies Explained below are the key accounting policies of the Group.
The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included on pages 113 to 120. a Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
The Directors believe that the adjusted profit before tax and adjusted diluted and basic earnings per share measures presented provide a reliable and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group.
Adjusted profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted profit measures of other companies.
The business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis using adjusted results.
To arrive at adjusted results, certain adjustments are made for normalised and exceptional items that are individually important and which could, if included, distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Normalised items These are recurring items which management considers to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group, and are non-cash items.
These items relate to amortisation of intangibles excluding other software, share-based payment charges and fair value adjustments on financial derivatives, although other types of recurring items may arise.
Recurring items are adjusted each year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Exceptional items These are items which are non-recurring and are identified by virtue of either their size or their nature.
These items can include, but are not restricted to, the costs of significant restructuring exercises, fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
In the prior year, deferred revenue was presented as part of the line item trade and other payables: in the current year deferred revenue is presented as a separate line item on the balance sheet.
The prior year line item trade and other payables therefore decreased by the amount of deferred revenue of 46,874,000.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc are included on pages 107 to 111. b Revenue The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser extent indirectly through resellers.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes.
It comprises initial licence fees, annual licence fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until: a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced: delivery has been made in accordance with that contract: if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met: and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Where extended payment terms beyond 90 days exist, appropriate approvals are obtained to ensure there is sufficient comfort that collectability is probable and the fee is determinable.
If approvals are not obtained, revenue is deferred until payment is due.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 83 Initial annual licence agreements Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is charged every year.
Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance, which includes core product upgrades and enhancements, and remote support services.
Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract, which is typically 12 months.
If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are noncancellable and consist of two separate components: the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with customer support and maintenance.
Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer.
This component is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront, provided all of the above criteria have been met.
Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model, a basket of tokens representing licences to use different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on the actual number of tokens used.
Services Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training, and are performed under separate service arrangements.
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject to acceptance criteria.
In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed.
c Significant accounting estimates Revenue recognition The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer.
This policy involves the assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects.
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use, and to customer support and maintenance, is reviewed periodically.
On average, the element attributable to customer support and maintenance as a proportion of the initial software delivery is 17%.
A 1% deviation in this percentage would not lead to a material change in revenue.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 84 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Key accounting policies continued Provision for impairment of receivables The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis.
The determination of the appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Groups customers and management consider a number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age of the receivable outstanding and the Groups trading experience with that customer.
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2017 was 6,054,000 2016 5,879,000.
Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates, timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in note 14.
Retirement benefit obligations The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied, together with sensitivity analysis, are described in note 25 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Groups future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs.
The net carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2017 was 3,810,000 2016 5,162,000. d Impairment of assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the selling and administrative expenses line item.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 26.

The adjustment made to profit after tax in calculating adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share has been adjusted for the tax effects of the items adjusted.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share is more representative of the underlying performance of the business.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 90 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 14 Goodwill 2017 2016 000 000 At 1 April 51,697 50,589 Acquisitions 2,793 Adjustments in respect of prior year acquisitions 4,260 Exchange adjustment 2,608 2,575 At 31 March 54,305 51,697 In the prior year the Group acquired FabTrol Systems Inc. and recorded goodwill of 2,793,000 and also incurred a goodwill adjustment of 4,260,000 in relation to the acquisition of 8over8 Limited.
Goodwill impairment tests The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the year by cash-generating unit.
2017 2016 000 000 Asia Pacific 20,303 19,446 EMEA 25,377 24,305 Americas 8,625 7,946 54,305 51,697 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
In 2016 17 the goodwill impairment testing was carried out on a value in use VIU basis using the most recently approved management budgets for the year ended 31 March 2018 together with the most recent three-year business plan extrapolated to a duration of five years in total.
Projected cash flows beyond five years have been assumed at the long-term growth rate for that region and these have been used to formulate a terminal value for the discounted cash flow calculation.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the most recent annual budget on which the cash flow projections are based relate to discount rates, long-term growth rates and operating margins.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the country and market risk.
Long-term growth rates used are assumed to be equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the region in which the CGU operates.
CGU operating margin is based on past results.
Discount rate Long-term growth rate 2017 2016 2017 2016 Asia Pacific 12% 12% 2.0% 2.0% EMEA 11% 9% 1.9% 1.0% Americas 11% 11% 1.9% 2.0% Summary of results During the year all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2016 nil.
As the VIU is most sensitive to a change in the discount rate and long-term growth rate, the Directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term growth rate and an increase in the discount rate and concluded that no reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimate exceeds the carrying value.
The purchased brand represents that acquired as part of the 8over8 acquisition in 2014 15 and is being amortised over five years.
For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation note 13, intangible asset amortisation excludes the charge relating to other software of 354,000 2016 338,000.

These leases have a duration of between one and five years.
Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
23 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds, accessibility and competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
The Group does not have any borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately 382,000 2016 633,000 and profit after tax by 306,000 2016 506,000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups presentational currency of Sterling.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 96 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 Financial risk management continued The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, South Korean Won and Japanese Yen, reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies, whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research & Development, are settled in Sterling, Indian Rupees and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages exchange risks, where possible, by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euros to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
In addition, it enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts, when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
Other currency exposures are less easy to hedge cost effectively.
At 31 March 2017, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $14.5 million 2016 $18 million and 9.8 million 2016 10.4 million.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling and Euro against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
Our analysis indicates that a 10% change in other currencies would not have a significant impact.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2015 16.
Increase decrease in average Profit loss Equity 31 March 2017 rate 000 000 US Dollar 10% 2,041 2,041 10% 2,248 2,248 Euro 10% 59 59 10% 65 65 Increase decrease in average Profit loss Equity 31 March 2016 rate 000 000 US Dollar 10% 1,450 1,450 10% 1,594 1,594 Euro 10% 267 267 10% 294 294 b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables.
Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
As set out in the Groups treasury policy, the amount of exposure to each counterparty is subject to a specific limit, up to a maximum of 50% of the Groups total counterparty risk.
Within this overall limit, some counterparties are subject to more restrictive caps on counterparty exposure.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 97 The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
Due to the credit control procedures in place, we believe all the receivables are of good quality.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows: Between Less than three Between six three months and months and Greater than months six months one year one year 000 000 000 000 As at 31 March 2017 Trade and other payables 42,528 As at 31 March 2016 Trade and other payables 35,966 The table below analyses the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts, which will be settled on a gross basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition, the Groups financial assets include forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 March 2017, the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
The fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was 196,000 at 31 March 2017 2016 864,000 liability.
The resulting gain of 668,000 2016 loss of 432,000 on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
e Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2016 or 2017.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.
24 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and the movements thereon, during the current and previous year: Retirement Expenses Other benefit Intangible Share deductible in temporary 1 obligations assets options future Losses differences Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2015 2,586 4,455 197 2,047 40 1,905 2,320 Acquisition 798 28 770 Credit charge to income statement 24 1,063 26 125 928 1,790 26 Charge credit to other comprehensive income 1,868 1,868 Credited to equity 2 2 Exchange adjustment 2 214 15 35 14 280 At 31 March 2016 692 4,404 173 1,907 933 129 570 Credit charge to income statement 164 964 93 404 67 206 1,024 Charge credit to other comprehensive income 395 395 Credited to equity 19 19 Exchange adjustment 54 126 237 22 8 135 At 31 March 2017 187 3,566 285 2,548 844 85 213 1 Other temporary differences consist principally of deferred tax on fixed assets and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 99 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2017 2016 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 3,381 3,187 Deferred tax assets 3,594 2,617 213 570 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 8,757,000 2016 7,005,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 2,317,000 2016 1,514,000, 844,000 2016 933,000 has been recognised and is included above.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 46,570,000 2016 37,134,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
25 Retirement benefit obligations The movement on the provision for retirement benefit obligations was as follows: German South UK defined defined Korean benefit benefit severance scheme schemes pay Total 000 000 000 000 At 31 March 2015 11,281 1,059 1,847 14,187 Current service cost 213 213 Net interest on pension scheme liabilities 506 30 42 578 Actuarial remeasurements 7,936 211 112 7,837 Employer contributions 1,580 11 471 2,062 Exchange adjustment 104 21 83 At 31 March 2016 2,271 1,393 1,498 5,162 Current service cost 227 227 Net interest on pension scheme liabilities 274 28 36 338 Actuarial remeasurements 2,187 27 10 2,170 Employer contributions 1,580 314 100 1,366 Exchange adjustment 122 275 397 At 31 March 2017 1,222 1,884 1,926 2,588 The UK defined benefit scheme surplus has been recognised as a non-current asset as the Group has a right to any remaining surplus after all liabilities are paid.
The Trustees may not distribute any surplus without the agreement of the Group.
If such agreement is withheld, the Trustees are required to repay any remaining funds to the Group.
a UK defined benefit scheme The Group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable pay which is funded.
This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 with the option of reopening if required and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004.
The scheme closed to future benefit accrual with effect from 1 April 2015.
Pensions are also payable to dependants on death.
Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a trust deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external, professionally qualified actuary, Broadstone Corporate Benefits Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 100 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows: 2017 2016 % % Main assumptions: Discount rate 2.50 3.40 Inflation assumption RPI 3.60 3.30 Rate of salary increases 5.60 5.30 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.30 3.10 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.60 2.30 Cash commutation 20% of pension 20% of pension The duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 19 years.
For the years ended 31 March 2017 and 2016, the mortality assumptions adopted imply the following weighted average life expectancies at age 65: 2017 2016 Years Years Male pensioners 23.1 23.1 Female pensioners 24.3 24.3 Non-retired males 24.3 24.2 Non-retired females 25.7 25.6 Company contributions were 1,580,000 2016 1,580,000, comprising deficit contributions totalling 1,400,000 per annum plus an administration charge of 180,000.
The total contributions in 2017 18 and 2018 19 are expected to be approximately 1,580,000 in each year.
The PPF levy of approximately 28,000 was payable in addition 2016 20,000.
The assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.

Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992.
No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
Benefit payments are made as they fall due.
The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005.
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012, AVEVA Software GmbH had been responsible for the pension obligations of six former Bocad employees.
At the time of the acquisition, the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding vehicles.
In March 2013, AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which resulted in the insurance company being obliged to provide all benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments, with AVEVA only having an obligation if the external insurance provider defaults.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee.
This scheme is closed to new members.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 102 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below: 2017 2016 Rate of increase of pension in payment 1.25%2.5% 1.25%2.5% Discount rate 1.5%1.55% 1.5%2.5% Mortality 1320 years 1320 years Rate of salary increases N A N A The retirement ages for the Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH schemes were 60 and 63 years of age respectively 2016 60 and 63 years of age.
c South Korean severance pay South Korean employees are entitled to a lump sum on severance of their employment equal to one months salary for each year of service.
The IAS 19 valuation of the liability has been carried out using the following assumptions: 2017 2016 % % Rate of salary increases 4.00 4.00 Discount rate 2.60 2.29 The retirement age for AVEVA Korea Limited employees is 60 years of age 2016 60 years of age.
d Other retirement schemes All Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ITP, an industry scheme for salaried employees which provides benefits in addition to the state pension arrangements.
The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance company.
It is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component.
AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee.
AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension scheme.
At 31 March 2017, Alectas surplus in the form of collective funding level was 152% 2016 144% which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies.
The total cost charged to the income statement was 879,042 2016 701,550. e Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, Norwegian and Asian employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The total cost charged to income of 6,465,670 2016 6,346,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.
26 Share-based payment plans The Group has four equity-settled share schemes: the AVEVA Group plc Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP : the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme: the AVEVA Group plc Senior Employee Restricted Share Plan 2015: and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007.
