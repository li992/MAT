As a result of this change prior year comparatives have been restated.
Borrowings are considered current if the contractual maturity dates are within a year.
Where subordinated debt is undated or loan notes are perpetual, the interest payments have not been included beyond 15 years.
Annual interest payments in future years for these borrowings are 82 million 2016: 82 million.
Contractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest rates or prevailing market floating rates as applicable.
Year-end exchange rates have been used for interest projections on loans in foreign currencies.

These loan notes are carried at fair value, their values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a market-determined liquidity premium, and are therefore classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.
This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.
The securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates.
