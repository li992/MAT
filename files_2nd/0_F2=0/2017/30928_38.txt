SHAREHOLDER SECURITY HOW TO AVOID SHARE FRAUD Shareholders may receive unsolicited and suspicious phone calls from brokers offering to buy their shares at a price far in excess of their market value.
We believe this may be a scam, commonly referred to as a boiler room.
The callers obtain your details from publicly available sources of information.
Shareholders are cautioned to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, or to sell your shares at a premium.
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
You should treat the call with extreme caution.
The safest thing to do is to hang up.
