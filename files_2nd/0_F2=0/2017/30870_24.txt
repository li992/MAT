Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 155 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 1 Basis of preparation Dual listed structure The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company DLC structure.
The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries, operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.
The Groups combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB : the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee: Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in note 33.
There are no differences for the Group in applying IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and, therefore, the Group also complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Strategic report within Our principal risks under the heading Going concern on page 41.
Critical accounting judgements and key estimates The preparation of the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions.
Although the estimates used are based on managements best information about current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The most significant estimates and judgements are: Key estimates e Fair value of forestry assets refer to note 13 e Actuarial valuations of retirement benefit obligations refer to note 22 e Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations refer to note 23 Critical accounting judgements and other accounting estimates e Impairment of goodwill refer to note 11 e Impairment of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets refer to notes 10 and 12 e Residual values and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment refer to notes 10 and 33 e Taxation refer to notes 7 and 33 Special items note 3 Special items are those items of financial performance that the Group considers should be separately disclosed to improve the understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group as special items affect year-on-year comparability.
Such items are generally material by nature and the quantitative threshold for recognition of special items is 10 million.
Subsequent adjustments to items previously recognised as special items continue to be reflected as special items in future periods even if they do not exceed the quantitative reporting threshold.
Mondi Group 156 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 2 Operating segments Effective from 1 October 2017, the Group reorganised its business units to reflect the nature of the underlying products produced.
The changes to the Groups business units, and consequently to the Groups segmental reporting, are as follows: e Uncoated Fine Paper and South Africa, excluding the containerboard operations, were merged into a single business unit: e the containerboard operations of South Africa were merged into Packaging Paper: and e there were no changes to the Fibre Packaging or Consumer Packaging business units.
Prior year figures have been restated to reflect the new organisational structure.
The reorganisation had no impact on the overall Group result.
The material product types from which the Groups externally reportable segments derive both their internal and external revenues are as follows: Operating segments Product types Packaging Paper Packaging paper Pulp Fibre Packaging Corrugated packaging Industrial bags Extrusion coatings Consumer Packaging Consumer goods packaging Personal care components Technical films Release liners Uncoated Fine Paper Uncoated fine paper Pulp Newsprint Year ended 31December 2017 Packaging Fibre Consumer Uncoated Intersegment million, unless otherwise stated Paper Packaging Packaging Fine Paper Corporate elimination Total Segment revenue 2,292 2,055 1,646 1,832 729 7,096 Internal revenue 642 34 5 48 729 External revenue 1,650 2,021 1,641 1,784 7,096 Underlying EBITDA 629 189 215 449 38 1,444 Depreciation and impairments 143 72 62 116 393 Amortisation 4 6 21 2 33 Underlying operating profit loss 482 111 132 331 38 1,018 Special items 3 49 15 61 Operating segment assets 2,469 1,363 1,539 1,757 15 187 6,956 Operating segment net assets 2,101 1,063 1,313 1,446 6 5,929 Additions to non-current non-financial assets 316 122 143 180 761 Capital expenditure cash payments 283 115 91 122 611 Underlying operating profit margin % 21.0 5.4 8.0 18.1 14.3 Return on capital employed % 26.3 11.3 10.4 27.8 19.7 Average number of employees 1 thousands 5.3 8.1 6.0 6.8 0.1 26.3 Note: 1 Presented on a full time employee equivalent basis Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 157 Year ended 31 December 2016 restated Packaging Fibre Consumer Uncoated Intersegment million, unless otherwise stated Paper Packaging Packaging Fine Paper Corporate elimination Total Segment revenue 2,103 1,929 1,562 1,720 652 6,662 Internal revenue 579 32 4 37 652 External revenue 1,524 1,897 1,558 1,683 6,662 Underlying EBITDA 527 194 198 481 34 1,366 Depreciation and impairments 126 66 59 104 1 356 Amortisation 4 5 18 2 29 Underlying operating profit loss 397 123 121 375 35 981 Special items 13 19 6 38 Operating segment assets 2,215 1,315 1,502 1,781 4 161 6,656 Operating segment net assets 1,876 1,006 1,270 1,466 5,618 Additions to non-current non-financial assets 168 161 217 134 680 Capital expenditure cash payments 175 107 91 92 465 Underlying operating profit margin % 18.9 6.4 7.7 21.8 14.7 Return on capital employed % 23.1 13.5 10.5 32.3 20.3 Average number of employees 1 thousands 5.3 7.7 5.3 7.0 0.1 25.4 Note: 1 Presented on a full time employee equivalent basis Reconciliation of underlying EBITDA and underlying operating profit to profit before tax million 2017 2016 Underlying EBITDA 1,444 1,366 Depreciation and impairments 393 356 Amortisation 33 29 Underlying operating profit 1,018 981 Special items see note 3 61 38 Net profit from equity accounted investees 1 1 Net finance costs 71 101 Profit before tax 887 843 Reconciliation of operating segment assets 2017 2016 Segment Segment net Segment Segment net million assets assets assets assets Group total 6,956 5,929 6,656 5,618 Unallocated Investment in equity accounted investees 3 3 9 9 Deferred tax assets liabilities 25 230 26 241 Other non-operating assets liabilities 178 337 209 307 Group capital employed 7,162 5,365 6,900 5,079 Financial instruments net debt 47 1,326 410 1,383 Total assets equity 7,209 4,039 7,310 3,696 Mondi Group 158 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 2 Operating segments External revenue External revenue by location of production by location of customer million 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue Africa South Africa 617 594 426 407 Rest of Africa 19 13 206 200 Africa total 636 607 632 607 Western Europe Austria 1,043 1,018 146 143 Germany 891 897 952 929 United Kingdom 75 33 241 224 Rest of western Europe 532 529 1,340 1,278 Western Europe total 2,541 2,477 2,679 2,574 Emerging Europe Poland 992 900 592 546 Rest of emerging Europe 1,348 1,246 954 883 Emerging Europe total 2,340 2,146 1,546 1,429 Russia 907 760 720 602 North America 583 588 747 729 South America 71 70 Asia and Australia 89 84 701 651 Group total 7,096 6,662 7,096 6,662 There were no external customers which account for more than 10% of the Groups total external revenue.

UK tax legislation largely exempts, from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1July2009.
As a result, the gross temporary differences at 31December 2017 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate and non-UK corporate taxes on dividends.

These amounts are deductible for tax purposes either when incurred or included in the amount permitted to be deducted for capital expenditure, depending on the jurisdiction in which they are capitalised.
The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is determined based on the use of the asset within the current business plans.
Any change in future intentions could result in an impairment of varying magnitude, depending on the assets affected.

The recoverable amounts of these groups of CGUs are the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use and are as follows: Carrying value Weighted average pre-tax million, unless otherwise stated discount rate Growth rate 2017 2016 Consumer Packaging 9.3% 2% 428 412 Kraft Paper 9.3% 0% 83 83 Containerboard 11.0% 0% 63 59 Industrial Bags 10.0% 0% 47 49 Corrugated Packaging 10.3% 0% 38 39 Uncoated Fine Paper 11.6% 0% 32 32 Extrusion Coatings 9.0% 0% 7 7 Total goodwill 698 681 Key assumptions The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are: e cash flow forecasts which are derived from the budgets most recently approved by the Boards covering the three-year period to 31 December 2020: e sales volumes, sales prices and variable input cost assumptions in the budget period are derived from a combination of economic forecasts for the regions in which the Group operates, industry forecasts for individual product lines, internal management projections, historical performance, and announced industry capacity changes: e cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management projections taking into consideration industry forecasts and growth rates in the regions in which the Group operates.
In general, such growth rates are assumed to be zero, except for Consumer Packaging, where a growth rate of 2% is applied for each of the following seven years beyond the budget period and zero thereafter into perpetuity: and e capital expenditure forecasts are based on historical experience and include expenditure necessary to maintain the projected cash flows from operations at current operating levels.
The pre-tax discount rate is derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
In determining the discount rate applicable to each group of CGUs, adjustments are made to reflect the impacts of country risk and tax.
Sensitivity analyses Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time.
They are affected by a number of factors, including market and production estimates, together with economic factors such as prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, estimates of production costs, and future capital expenditure.
Sensitivity analyses of reasonably possible changes in the underlying assumptions for each group of CGUs included: e 1% increase in discount rate: e 0% growth rate assumed in Consumer Packaging: e 5% decrease in sales prices in Packaging Paper Containerboard and Kraft Paper groups of CGUs and Uncoated Fine Paper: and e 3% decrease in gross margin in Consumer Packaging and Fibre Packaging Corrugated Packaging, Industrial Bags and Extrusion Coatings groups of CGUs.
None of these downside sensitivity analyses in isolation indicated the need for an impairment.

79,159 hectares 2016: 81,017 hectares are set aside for conservation activities and infrastructure needs.
In 2016, 11,784 hectares were managed but not controlled by the Group, none in 2017.
1,664 hectares 2016: 3,097 hectares relate to non-core activities.
The balance of 164,340 hectares 2016: 155,537 hectares are under afforestation which forms the basis of the valuation set out above.
Mature forestry assets are those plantations that are harvestable, while immature forestry assets have not yet reached that stage of growth.
Timber is harvested according to a rotation plan, once trees reach maturity.
This period ranges from 6.5 to 14.5 years, depending on species, climate and location.
Mondi Group 168 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 13 Forestry assets The fair value of forestry assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy, consistent with prior years.
The following assumptions have a significant impact on the valuation of the Groups forestry assets: e The net selling price, which is defined as the selling price less the costs of transport, harvesting, extraction and loading.
The net selling price is based on third-party transactions and is influenced by the species, maturity profile and location of timber.
In 2017, the net selling price used ranged from the South African rand equivalent of 17 per tonne to 47 per tonne 2016: 10 per tonne to 53 per tonne with a weighted average of 29 per tonne 2016: 28 per tonne.
e The conversion factor used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of standing timber, which is dependent on the species, the maturity profile of the timber, the geographic location, climate and a variety of other environmental factors.
In 2017, the conversion factors ranged from 8.4 to 24.8 2016: 8.6 to 25.0. e The risk premium of 13.0% 2016: 14.0% is based on an assessment of the risks associated with forestry assets in South Africa.
The valuation of the Groups forestry assets is determined in rand and converted to euro at the closing exchange rate on 31December of each year.
The reported value of owned forestry assets would change as follows should there be a change in these underlying assumptions on the basis that all other factors remain unchanged: million 2017 Effect of 1 tonne increase in net selling price 11 Effect of 1% increase in conversion factor hectares to tonnes 3 Effect of 1% increase in risk premium 4 Effect of 1% increase in EUR ZAR exchange rate 3 14 Inventories million 2017 2016 Valued using the first-in-first-out cost formula Raw materials and consumables 34 28 Work in progress 13 15 Finished products 27 22 Total valued using the first-in-first-out cost formula 74 65 Valued using the weighted average cost formula Raw materials and consumables 333 334 Work in progress 109 104 Finished products 351 347 Total valued using the weighted average cost formula 793 785 Total inventories 867 850 Of which, held at net realisable value 119 137 Combined and consolidated income statement Cost of inventories recognised as an expense 3,057 2,866 Write-down of inventories to net realisable value 22 29 Aggregate reversal of previous write-downs of inventories 19 18 Green energy sales and disposal of emissions credits 62 48 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 169 15 Trade and other receivables million 2017 2016 Trade receivables 993 909 Allowance for doubtful debts 32 32 Net trade receivables 961 877 Other receivables 32 58 Tax and social security 90 93 Prepayments and accrued income 23 21 Total trade and other receivables 1,106 1,049 The fair values of trade and other receivables approximate their carrying values presented.
Trade receivables: credit risk The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any particular customer.
The Group considers that there is no significant geographical or customer concentration of credit risk.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the relevant markets that they serve.
The Group considers that management of credit risk on a decentralised basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management are observed across all business segments, such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.
million 2017 2016 Credit risk exposure Gross trade receivables 993 909 Credit insurance 815 707 Total exposure to credit risk 178 202 The insured cover is presented gross of contractually agreed excess amounts.
In addition, the Group is in possession of bank guarantees and letters of credit securing trade and other receivables to the value of 16 million 2016: 13 million.
Credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and invoicing conventions established by, participants operating in the various markets in which the Group operates.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are considered overdue in the relevant market.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the combined and consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
The total gross carrying value of trade receivables that were subject to impairment during the year is 64million 2016:102million.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 30million 2016:20million which are past due but not impaired at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and considers that their credit quality remains intact.

The Group is committed to managing its cost of capital by maintaining an appropriate capital structure, with a balance between equity and net debt.
The Group utilises its capital employed to fund the growth of the business and to finance its liquidity needs.
The primary sources of the Groups net debt include its 2.5 billion Guaranteed Euro Medium Term Note Programme, its 750million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility and financing from various banks and other credit agencies, thus providing the Group with access to diverse sources of debt financing.

The 500 million Eurobond maturing in 2020 contains a coupon step-up clause whereby the coupon will be increased by 1.25% per annum if the Group fails to maintain at least one investment grade credit rating from either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors.
Mondi currently has investment grade credit ratings from both Moodys Investors Service Baa1, outlook stable and Standard & Poors BBB, outlook positive.
Short-term liquidity needs are met through the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility.
The Group reviews its capital employed on a regular basis and makes use of several indicative ratios which are appropriate to the nature of its operations and consistent with conventional industry measures.
The principal ratios used include: e pre-tax weighted average cost of capital: e gearing, defined as net debt divided by capital employed: e net debt to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA: and e return on capital employed, defined as trailing 12-month underlying operating profit, including share of equity accounted investees net profit loss, divided by trailing 12-month average capital employed.
Capital employed is adjusted for spend on those strategic projects which are not yet in production.

The Group operates a DLC structure, the terms of which require that the capital supplied by, or made available to, the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc be constrained by the equality of treatment mechanism.
This serves to maintain and protect the economic interests of both sets of shareholders.
The Group is subject to certain exchange control conditions as agreed with the South African Ministry of Finance.
These conditions do not infringe upon the Groups ability to manage optimally its capital structure.
The Group has continuously met the exchange control provisions in the past and management is committed to ensuring that the Group continues to meet these provisions in the future.

It also operates two post-retirement medical plans.
Defined contribution plans The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans of 14 million 2016: 14 million is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at the reporting dates presented.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined contribution plans during 2018 are 16 million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans The Group operates in excess of 100 defined benefit retirement plans across its global operations.
A large proportion of the Groups defined benefit plans are closed to new members.
The majority of these plans are unfunded and provide pensions and severance benefits to members of those plans.
The most significant unfunded defined benefit plans are operated in Austria, Germany and Russia and funded plans are operated primarily in the UK.
These plans are established in accordance with applicable local labour legislation and or collective agreements with participating employees.
The benefits are based on a variety of factors, the most significant of which are a combination of pensionable service and final salary.
A number of these plans also provide additional benefits in the event of death in service, disability or ill-health retirement which are derived from the final salary benefit formula.
Mondi Group 176 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 22 Retirement benefits The assets of the funded plans are held separately in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice where those funds are operated.
The boards of trustees of these plans are required to act in the best interest of the plans and all relevant stakeholders of the plans active employees, inactive employees, retirees and employers, and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the plans.
The post-retirement medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain of their dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The South African plan is unfunded while the Austrian plan is funded.
The South African plan has been closed to new participants since 1January1999.
Except for the actuarial risks set out below, the Group has not identified any additional specific risks in respect of these plans.
Defined benefit plans typically expose the Group to the following actuarial risks: Investment risk Asset volatility The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high-quality bond yields.
If the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit that needs to be funded guaranteed by the employer.
Currently the plan assets have a relatively balanced investment in equity and bonds.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the boards of trustees consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equities.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase plan liabilities, however this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans fixed rate debt instruments.
Longevity risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
Salary risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated by reference to the expected future salaries of plan participants.
An increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
Medical cost inflation risk The present value of the post-retirement medical plans is calculated by reference to expected future medical costs.
An increase in medical cost inflation will increase the plan liabilities.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every year using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial assumptions The weighted average principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are detailed below: 2017 2016 % South Africa Europe Other regions South Africa Europe Other regions Discount rate 9.5 1.9 7.8 9.5 1.9 8.2 Rate of inflation 6.8 2.3 4.3 7.2 2.3 5.1 Rate of increase in salaries 7.8 2.8 5.5 8.2 2.0 6.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.9 4.0 2.8 3.5 Expected average increase of medical costs 8.3 3.7 8.7 3.9 The assumption for the discount rate for plan liabilities is based on AA corporate bonds, which are of a suitable duration and currency.
In South Africa, the discount rate assumption has been based on the zero coupon government bond yield curve.

It is expected that the Groups share of contributions will increase as the schemes members age.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans during 2018 are 18 million.
The market values of the plan assets in these plans are detailed below: 2017 2016 million Quoted Unquoted Total Quoted Unquoted Total External equity 40 40 37 37 Bonds 83 83 84 84 Insurance contracts 17 17 16 16 Cash 2 2 1 1 Fair value of plan assets 125 17 142 122 16 138 The majority of the Groups plan assets are located in Austria and the UK and the following asset-liability matching investing strategies are applied: Austria The investment strategy is based on Austrian Social Security Law which stipulates that investments can only be made in high-quality euro bonds or deposits in euro in highly rated financial institutions.
No investments in equity or equity funds are allowed.
Due to legal and market restrictions asset-liability matching is not possible.
UK The trustees invest in diverse portfolios of pooled funds.
The long-term objective is to ensure that each plan can continue to meet the benefit payments without exposing either the plan or the company to an undue level of risk.
The mix of investments in each plan is determined taking into account the maturity, currency and nature of the expected benefit payments required.
There are no financial instruments or property owned by the Group included in the fair value of plan assets.
The fair values of equity, bonds and cash are determined based on quoted prices in active markets.
The fair value of insurance contracts is determined in accordance with IAS 19.
The actual return on plan assets in respect of defined benefit plans was a gain of 11 million 2016: gain of 19 million.
The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 83% 2016: 79% of the benefits which have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions at rates agreed with the plans trustees and in accordance with local independent actuarial advice and statutory provisions.
In certain jurisdictions, Group plans are subject to minimum funding requirements.
At 31December 2017, these minimum funding requirements did not give rise to the recognition of any additional liabilities.
Sensitivity analyses The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes to the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of the actual changes in the net retirement benefits asset liability as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another and some of the assumptions may be inter-related.
The projected unit credit method was used to calculate the sensitivity analyses below.

As at 31December, the Group had the following outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2017 2016 Land, buildings Land, buildings Forestry and other Forestry and other million assets assets assets assets Within one year 12 30 5 26 One to two years 11 30 5 19 Two to five years 32 39 14 37 After five years 229 33 134 23 Total operating leases 284 132 158 105 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 185 29 Financial instruments The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Boards and are overseen by the DLC executive committee.
In turn, the DLC executive committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group treasury continually reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment: identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks by entering into derivative contracts with counterparties where appropriate.
The Group does not take speculative positions on derivative contracts.

c Financial risk management Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Both risks are actively monitored on a regular basis and managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps as appropriate.
Although the Groups cash flows are exposed to movements in key input and output prices, such movements represent commercial rather than financial risk inherent to the Group.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates globally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of its business.
Multiple currency exposures arise from commercial transactions denominated in foreign currencies, recognised financial assets and liabilities monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and translational exposure on net investments in foreign operations.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 187 Foreign exchange contracts The Groups treasury policy requires subsidiaries to actively manage foreign currency transactional exposures against their functional currencies by entering into foreign exchange contracts.
For segmental reporting purposes, each subsidiary enters into, and accounts for, foreign exchange contracts with Group treasury or with counterparties that are external to the Group, whichever is more commercially appropriate.
Only material balance sheet exposures and highly probable forecast capital expenditure transactions are hedged.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis has been performed on the foreign currency exposures inherent in the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting dates presented, net of related foreign exchange contracts.
The sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the Groups reported earnings of reasonably possible changes in the currency exposures embedded within the functional currency environments that the Group operates in.
In addition, an indication is provided of how reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates might impact on the Groups equity, as a result of fair value adjustments to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
Reasonably possible changes are based on an analysis of historical currency volatility, together with any relevant assumptions regarding near-term future volatility.
Net monetary foreign currency exposures by functional currency zone 1 Net monetary foreign currency exposures assets liabilities 2017 2016 million EUR Other EUR Other 2 Functional currency zones Euro 1 7 South African rand 3 1 2 1 Czech koruna 11 5 Polish zloty 11 3 16 2 Russian rouble 18 3 16 1 Swedish krona 10 17 Turkish lira 4 1 5 Other 37 14 24 15 Notes: 1 Presented in euro, the presentation currency of the Group 2 Net monetary exposures represent financial assets less financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency, adjusted for the effects of foreign exchange risk hedging, excluding cash flow hedging of non-monetary assets and liabilities Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates The Group considers that for each functional to foreign currency net monetary exposure it is reasonable to assume a 5% appreciation depreciation of the functional currency.
If all other variables are held constant, the table below presents the impacts on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement if these currency movements had occurred.

It has been assumed that changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of non-monetary assets and liabilities are fully recorded in equity and that all other variables are held constant.
Mondi Group 188 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 29 Financial instruments Interest rate risk The Group holds cash and cash equivalents, which earn interest at a variable rate and has variable and fixed rate debt in issue.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk.
Although the Group has fixed rate debt in issue, the Groups accounting policy stipulates that all borrowings be held at amortised cost.
As a result, the carrying value of fixed rate debt is not sensitive to changes in credit conditions in the relevant debt markets and there is, therefore, no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
Management of cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term highly liquid investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Centralised cash pooling arrangements are in place, which ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and, in addition, to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
Management of variable rate debt The Group has multiple variable rate debt facilities, of which the most significant is the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility see note 18.
When deemed necessary, Group treasury uses interest rate swaps to hedge certain exposures to movements in the relevant interbank lending rates, primarily the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate JIBAR.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents act as a natural hedge to movements in the relevant interbank lending rates on its variable rate debt, subject to any interest rate differentials that exist between the Groups corporate saving and lending rates.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity analysis The net variable rate exposure represents variable rate debt less the future cash outflows swapped from variable-to-fixed via interest rate swap instruments and cash and cash equivalents.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates have been applied to the net variable rate exposure, denominated by currency, in order to provide an indication of the possible impact on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.
Interest rate risk sensitivities on variable rate debt Interest rate risk exposures 2017 2016 million EUR Other Total EUR Other Total Total debt 1,128 237 1,365 1,627 143 1,770 Less: Fixed rate debt 999 11 1,010 1,498 11 1,509 Cash and cash equivalents 6 32 38 340 64 404 Net variable rate debt and exposure 123 194 317 211 68 143 Included in other is net variable exposure to various currencies, the most significant of which are ZAR and TRY 2016: ZAR and TRY.
The Group did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps at 31December 2017.
The potential impact on the Groups combined and consolidated equity resulting from the application of 50 basis points to the variable interest rate exposure would be a loss of 2 million 2016: gain of 1 million and vice versa for a -50 fall in basis points.
In addition to the above, the Group swaps euro and sterling debt into other currencies through the foreign exchange market using foreign exchange contracts which has the effect of exposing the Group to the interest rates of these currencies.
The currencies swapped into out of and the amounts as at 31December were as follows: million 2017 2016 Short-dated contracts with tenures of less than 12 months Pounds sterling 7 12 Czech koruna 251 188 Polish zloty 297 317 Russian rouble 164 27 Swedish krona 31 39 US dollar 96 119 Other 89 96 Total swapped 607 798 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 189 Credit risk The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 15.
Several Group entities have also issued certain financial guarantees to external counterparties in order to achieve competitive funding rates for specific debt agreements entered into by other Group entities.
None of these financial guarantees contractually obligates the Group to pay more than the recognised financial liabilities in the entities concerned.
As a result, these financial guarantee contracts have no bearing on the credit risk profile of the Group as a whole.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and retrospectively assessed assumptions to forecast the future cashgenerative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
The following table shows the amounts available to draw down on the Groups committed loan facilities: million 2017 2016 Expiry date Within one year 58 62 Two to five years 733 750 Total credit available see note 18 791 812 Forecast liquidity represents the Groups expected cash inflows, principally generated from sales made to customers, less the Groups expected cash outflows, principally related to the payment of employees, supplier payments and the repayment of borrowings plus the payment of any interest accruing thereon.
The matching of these cash inflows and outflows rests on the expected ageing profiles of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Short-term financial assets and financial liabilities are primarily represented by the Groups trade receivables and trade payables.
The matching of the cash flows that result from trade receivables and trade payables typically takes place over a period of three to four months from recognition in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position and is managed to ensure the ongoing operating liquidity of the Group.
Financing cash outflows may be longer-term in nature.
The Group does not hold long-term financial assets to match against these commitments, but is significantly invested in long-term non-financial assets which generate the sustainable future cash inflows, net of future capital expenditure requirements, needed to service and repay the Groups borrowings.
d Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value.
At 31December 2017, the Group recognised total derivative assets of 13million 2016: 6 million and derivative liabilities of 8 million 2016: 23 million.
The full net asset of 5 million 2016: net liability of 17million will mature within one year.
The notional amount of 1,605 million 2016: 1,149 million is the aggregate face value of all derivatives outstanding at the reporting date.
They do not indicate the contractual future cash flows of the derivative instruments held or their current fair value and, therefore, do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or market risks.
Of the 1,605 million 2016: 1,149 million aggregate notional amount, 1,305 million 2016:970 million relates to the economic hedging of foreign exchange exposures on short-term inter-company funding balances, which are fully eliminated on consolidation.
Hedging Cash flow hedges The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges.
The fair value gains losses are reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit and loss in the period when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
For non-current nonfinancial assets, these gains losses are included in the carrying value of the asset and depreciated over the same useful life as the cost of the asset.
No fair value gains losses 2016: gains of 1 million were reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to property, plant and equipment during the current year.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss arising on cash flow hedges for both years presented.

Mondi Group 192 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 33 Accounting policies Basis of consolidation The combined and consolidated financial statements incorporate the revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, equity and cash flows of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, and of their respective subsidiaries together the Group, and the Groups share of equity accounted investees drawn up to 31December each year.
All intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.
A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control.
Control is evident where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with that entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over that entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the years presented are included in the combined and consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquiring control or up to the effective date of disposal.
Non-controlling interests are measured, at initial recognition, as the non-controlling proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.
After initial recognition, non-controlling interests are measured as the aggregate of the value at initial recognition and their subsequent proportionate share of profits and losses less any distributions made.
Changes in the Groups interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Any resulting difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration payable or receivable is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the shareholders.
Foreign currency transactions and translation Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the entity that has undertaken the transaction using the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions.
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the combined and consolidated income statement and are classified as either operating or financing consistent with the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them.
Translation of overseas operations The Groups results are presented in euro, the currency in which most of its business is conducted.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the month in which they occur where these approximate the rates on the dates of the underlying transactions.
Exchange differences, if any, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are reclassified to profit and loss only on disposal or partial disposal of the overseas operation.
Fair value measurement Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, or where the fair value of financial instruments has been disclosed in notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements, are based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy: e level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: e level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : and e level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The assets measured at fair value on level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy are the Groups forestry assets as set out in note 13, certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations, and put options held by non-controlling interests.
The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives are determined using generally accepted valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.
Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include: e the fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves and exchange rates: e the fair values of the Groups commodity price derivatives are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable market data: and e other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 193 Segmental reporting note 2 The Groups operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the DLC executive committee, the chief operating decision-making body.
The operating segments are managed based on the nature of the underlying products produced by those businesses and comprise four distinct segments.
Measurement of operating segment revenues, profit and loss, assets and non-current non-financial assets Each of the reportable segments derives its income from the sale of manufactured products.
The operating segment measures adhere to the recognition and measurement criteria presented in the Groups accounting policies and are presented on an underlying basis, excluding special items.
The Group has presented certain non-IFRS measures by segment to supplement the users understanding.
All intra-group transactions are conducted on an arms length basis.
The Groups measure of net segment assets includes the allocation of net retirement benefits assets and liabilities.
The measure of segment results exclude, however, the financing effects of the Groups defined benefit retirement plans.
In addition, the Groups measure of net segment assets does not include an allocation for derivative assets and liabilities, non-operating receivables and payables and assets held for sale and associated liabilities.
The measure of segment results includes the effects of certain movements in these unallocated balances.
There has been no change in the basis of measurement of segment profit and loss in the financial year.
Revenue recognition Sale of goods note 2 Revenue is derived principally from the sale of goods and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
This is when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer which is typically when the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location.
Other income Sale of green energy and CO e credits note 14 2 Income generated from the sale of green energy and CO e credits issued under international trading schemes is measured at the 2 consideration received in exchange for transferring such credits.
The income is recorded within other net operating expenses in the combined and consolidated income statement when ownership rights pass to the buyer.
Any unsold green energy credits are recorded in inventory.
Investment income note 6 Interest income, which is derived from cash and cash equivalents and other interest-bearing financial assets, is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable effective interest rate.
Interest income is included in net finance costs.
Mondi Group 194 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 33 Accounting policies Taxation note 7 The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax charge and the movement in deferred tax.
Current tax The current tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups asset liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The Group is regularly subjected to routine tax audits.
Provision is made based on the tax laws in the relevant country and the expected outcomes of any negotiations or settlements.
The Group is subject to corporate taxes in a number of jurisdictions and a degree of estimation and judgement is required in determining the appropriate tax provision for transactions where the tax treatment is uncertain.
In these circumstances, the Group recognises provisions for taxes based on information available where the anticipated liability is both probable and estimable.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition, other than in a business combination, of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date.
The carrying amount is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered within a reasonable period of time.
Similarly, it is increased to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future for all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered within a reasonable period of time.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted and are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the combined and consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also taken directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The Group applies the initial recognition exemption model to account for any investment tax credits.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences relating to investment tax credits due to the availability of the initial recognition exemption.
Earnings per share EPS note 8 Basic EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of the sum of ordinary Mondi Limited and Mondi plc shares in issue during the year, net of treasury shares.
Diluted EPS For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of the sum of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary shares in issue, net of treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
At present these only include share awards granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issues are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease EPS.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 195 Non-current non-financial assets excluding goodwill, deferred tax and net retirement benefits asset Property, plant and equipment note 10 Property, plant and equipment principally comprise land and buildings, plant and equipment and assets in the course of construction.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Land and assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less impairment.
Cost includes site preparation, the purchase price of the equipment and directly attributable labour and installation costs.
Borrowing costs are capitalised on qualifying assets.
The capitalisation of costs ceases when the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of commercial operation.
Start-up and ongoing maintenance costs are not capitalised.
Depreciation is charged to the combined and consolidated income statement so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Estimated useful lives range from three years to 20 years for items of plant and equipment and other categories and to a maximum of 50 years for buildings.
Intangible assets and research and development expenditure note 12 Intangible assets are measured initially at purchase consideration and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives vary between three years and 10 years and are reviewed at least annually.
Research expenditure is expensed in the year in which it is incurred.
Development costs are capitalised when the completion of the asset is both commercially and technically feasible and are amortised on a systematic basis over the economic life of the related development.
Development costs are recognised immediately as an expense if they do not qualify for capitalisation.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
If the recoverable amount of an asset, or cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset relates, is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset, or CGU, is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment recognised as an expense.
The recoverable amount of the asset, or CGU, is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use.
In assessing valuein-use, the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the smallest CGU to which the asset belongs.
Where the underlying circumstances change such that a previously recognised impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset, or CGU, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount.
Such a reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset, or CGU, in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Agriculture owned forestry assets note 13 Owned forestry assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell, calculated by applying the expected selling price, less costs to harvest and deliver, to the estimated volume of timber on hand at each reporting date.
The fair value less costs to sell is determined using a market approach.
The estimated volume of timber on hand is determined based on the maturity profile of the area under afforestation, the species, the geographic location and other environmental considerations and excludes future growth.
The product of these is then adjusted for risks associated with forestry assets.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement within other net operating expenses.
At point of felling, the carrying value of forestry assets is transferred to inventory.
Directly attributable costs incurred during the year of biological growth and investments in standing timber are capitalised and presented within cash flows from investing activities.
Mondi Group 196 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 33 Accounting policies Business combinations note 23 Identifiable net assets At the date of acquisition the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or equity accounted investee are recorded at their fair values on acquisition date.
Assets and liabilities which cannot be measured reliably are recorded at provisional fair values, which are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Cost of a business combination The cost of a business combination includes the fair value of assets provided, liabilities incurred or assumed, and any equity instruments issued by a Group entity, in exchange for control of an acquiree.
The directly attributable costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill note 11 Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is attributed to goodwill.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each financial year and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets covering a three-year period that are based on the latest forecasts for revenue and costs as approved by the Boards.
Projected revenues and costs are determined taking into consideration relevant industry forecasts for individual product lines, managements projections, historical performance and announced industry capacity changes.
Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management projections.
Growth rates in the countries in which the Group operates are determined with reference to published gross domestic product information, and for specific product lines are determined with reference to published industry studies.
The discount rate is determined as the Groups weighted average cost of capital using published market data and published borrowing rates and adjusted for country risk and tax.
Any impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Current non-financial assets Inventory note 14 Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the first-in-first-out FIFO or weighted average cost basis, as appropriate.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is defined as the selling price less any estimated costs of disposal.
Assets held for sale note 24 Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal from the date on which these conditions are met.
Any resulting impairment is reported in the combined and consolidated income statement.
On classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated or amortised.
Comparative amounts are not adjusted.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 197 Provisions note 17 Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, which it is probable it will be required to settle.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value using country specific discount rates for periods matching the duration of the underlying liability where the effect of discounting is material.
Equity instruments Treasury shares note 20 The purchase by any Group entity of either Mondi Limiteds or Mondi plcs equity instruments results in the recognition of treasury shares.
The consideration paid or payable is deducted from equity.
Where treasury shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received or receivable is included in equity attributable to the shareholders of either Mondi Limited or Mondi plc, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects.
Dividend payments note 9 Dividend distributions to Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary shareholders are recognised as a liability when the dividends are declared and approved.
Final dividends are accrued when approved by both Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary shareholders at their respective Annual General Meetings and interim dividends are recognised when approved by the Boards.
Share-based payments note 21 The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised concurrently as an expense and an adjustment to equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards granted, as adjusted for market performance conditions and non-market vesting conditions.
Vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share awards that are expected to vest as a result of changes in non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the combined and consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Financial instruments note 29 Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups combined and consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents note 25b Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term, highly liquid investments of a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current liabilities in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows and in the presentation of net debt are net of overdrafts.
Mondi Group 198 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 33 Accounting policies Trade receivables and payables notes 15 and 16 Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Trade receivables are reduced by an allowance for impairment.
Put options held by non-controlling interests note 29 Written put options on the shares of a subsidiary held by non-controlling interests give rise to a financial liability for the present value of the expected redemption amount.
The liability that may become payable under the arrangement is initially recognised at fair value with a corresponding entry directly in equity.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the liability are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Borrowings note 19 Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of direct transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs note 6 Interest on borrowings directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets is capitalised until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the construction period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting note 29d The Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position within derivative financial instruments.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not formally designated in hedge relationships are recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement and are classified within operating profit or net finance costs, depending on the type of risk to which the derivative relates.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset then, at the time the asset is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in the Groups cash flow hedge reserve in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset, amounts deferred in the Groups cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit and loss on a proportionate basis.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge relationship is revoked or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 199 Retirement benefits note 22 The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans for the majority of its employees as well as post-retirement medical plans.
Defined contribution plans For defined contribution plans, the amount charged to the combined and consolidated income statement is the contributions paid or payable during the reporting period.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans For defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans, actuarial valuations are performed at each financial year end using the projected unit credit method.
The average discount rate for the plans liabilities is based on investment grade rated corporate bonds or similar government bonds of a suitable duration and currency.
Plans assets are measured using market values at the end of the reporting period.
The net retirement benefits liability recognised in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit liability as reduced by the fair value of any plan assets.
Any increase in the present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during the year is charged to operating profit as service costs.
Past service costs resulting from plan amendments or curtailments and gains or losses on settlements are charged to operating profit.
A net interest expense or net interest income is calculated by applying the discount rate, on a per plan basis, to the net defined benefit liability or asset and recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement within net finance costs.
Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets after recognising the net finance charge are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax, in the reporting period in which they occur.
Remeasurements recorded in other comprehensive income are not recycled to the combined and consolidated income statement, but those amounts recognised in other comprehensive income may be transferred within equity.
Leases note 28 Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group has no material finance lease arrangements.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the combined and consolidated income statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern of use.
Alternative Performance Measures The Group presents certain measures of financial performance, position or cash flows in the combined and consolidated financial statements that are not defined or specified according to IFRS.
These measures, referred to as Alternative Performance Measures APMs, are prepared on a consistent basis for all periods presented in this report.
The most significant APMs are: Net debt note 25c A measure comprising short, medium, and long-term interest-bearing borrowings and the fair value of debt-related derivatives less cash and cash equivalents and current financial asset investments.
Net debt provides a measure of the Groups net indebtedness or overall leverage.
Return on capital employed ROCE notes 2 and 18 Trailing 12-month underlying operating profit, including share of equity accounted investees net profit loss, divided by trailing 12-month average capital employed and for segments has been extracted from management reports.
ROCE provides a measure of the efficient and effective use of capital in the business and is used for incentive purposes.
Special items note 3 Those financial items which the Group considers should be separately disclosed on the face of the combined and consolidated income statement to assist in understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group.
Such items are generally material by nature and exceed 10 million and the Group, therefore, excludes these items when reporting underlying earnings and related measures in order to provide a measure of the underlying performance of the Group on a basis that is comparable from year to year.
Mondi Group 200 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 33 Accounting policies Underlying EBITDA note 2 Operating profit before special items, depreciation, amortisation and impairments not recorded as special items.
Underlying EBITDA provides a measure of the absolute growth in the cash generating ability of the business and is used for incentive purposes.
Underlying operating profit combined and consolidated income statement Operating profit before special items.
Underlying operating profit provides a measure of operating performance and absolute growth in profitability of the operations.
Underlying profit before tax combined and consolidated income statement Profit before tax and special items.
Underlying profit before tax provides a measure of the absolute growth in profitability before tax.
Underlying earnings and per share measure note 8 Net profit after tax attributable to shareholders, before special items.
Underlying earnings and the related per share measure based on the basic, weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, provides a measure of the Groups absolute growth in earnings.
Underlying and headline EPS note 8 Underlying EPS excludes the impact of special items and is a non-IFRS measure.
It is included to provide an additional basis on which to measure the Groups earnings performance.
The presentation of headline EPS is mandated under the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited and is calculated in accordance with Circular 2 2015, Headline Earnings, as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Cash flow generation A measurement of the Groups cash generation before considering deployment of cash towards investment in property, plant and equipment capex or capital expenditure, acquisition and disposals and payment of dividends to shareholders.
Cash flow generation is a measure of the Groups ability to generate cash through the cycle before considering deployment of such cash.
Underlying EBITDA margin Underlying EBITDA expressed as a percentage of revenue provides a measure of the cash generating ability relative to revenue.
Underlying operating profit margin note 2 Underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of revenue provides a measure of the profitability of the operations relative to revenue.
Ordinary dividend cover Basic underlying EPS divided by total ordinary dividend per share paid and proposed provides a measure of the Groups earnings relative to its deployment towards ordinary dividend payments.
Net debt to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA Net debt divided by trailing 12-month underlying EBITDA.
A measure of the Groups net indebtedness relative to its cash generating ability.
Effective tax rate note 7a Underlying tax charge expressed as a percentage of underlying profit before tax.
A measure of the Groups tax charge relative to its profit before tax expressed on an underlying basis.

A measure of the Groups effective use of working capital relative to revenue.
Capex and investment in intangible assets as a percentage of depreciation, amortisation and impairments Capex and investment in intangible assets divided by depreciation, amortisation and non-special impairments provides a measure of reinvestment into the Groups asset base relative to depreciation, amortisation and impairments.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 201 New accounting policies, early adoption and future requirements Amendments to published Standards effective during 2017 The following amendments to Standards have been adopted for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2017, and have had no significant impact on the Groups results: e IAS 7 Statements of Cash Flows, disclosure initiative e IAS 12 Income Taxes New Standards and amendments to published Standards that are not yet effective The following new Standards are effective, or will be early adopted, for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2018, and are expected to have an impact on the Groups results: p IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Given the nature of the Groups business, while the Groups assessment of the impact of this standard is ongoing, no material impact is expected in respect of the measurement of financial instruments.
The revised financial instrument categories will result in changes in classification and additional disclosures.
p IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Given the nature of the Groups revenue streams, while the Groups assessment of the impact of this standard is ongoing, the Group does not expect any significant changes to the timing and recognition of revenue and no material impact is expected in the Groups results.
Additional disclosures will be required.
p IFRS 16 Leases The Group has elected to early adopt the Standard with full retrospective application and the practical expedients detailed below.
IFRS 16 introduces a single lease accounting model, requiring a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
The lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset, and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
Thus, leases classified as operating leases with lease payments recorded in the income statement under the existing policy will be included in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position.
The new treatment of leases will result in an increase in non-current assets and financial liabilities as these leases are capitalised as well as an increase in underlying EBITDA, offset by an increase in depreciation and an increase in finance charges.
This will result in a higher operating profit.
The depreciation charge is constant over the lease period, but finance charges decrease as the remaining lease liability decreases, resulting in a net reduction in profit before tax in the early part of a lease arrangement but a positive profit impact towards the end of the contract in contrast to the typical straight-line treatment of existing operating lease expenses.
Net debt is expected to increase due to the recognition of lease liabilities which are considered financial liabilities, whilst working capital will remain unaffected.
Group return on capital employed is expected to decrease due to the recognition of the lease liability increasing net debt, resulting in a higher capital employed.
A higher operating profit is expected to only partially offset this impact on Group return on capital employed.
Cash generated from operations is expected to increase due to certain lease expenses no longer being recognised as operating cash outflows, but this will be offset by a corresponding increase in cash used in financing activities due to repayments of the principal on lease liabilities.
Net cash flow will remain unchanged.
Whilst the Group is party to more than 1,000 leases, a large proportion of the Groups lease agreements are short-term in nature and not individually material in value.
The Group has elected to apply a practical expedient which excludes lease agreements which are short-term in nature and not individually material in value from being classified as leases in terms of IFRS 16.
The Group has also elected to adopt the transitional practical expedient such that the IFRS 16 definition of a lease would only be applied to assess whether contracts entered into after the date of initial application 1 January 2018 are, or contain leases.
All contracts previously assessed not to contain leases are not revisited.
Mondi Group 202 Integrated report and financial statements 2017 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 33 Accounting policies The Groups assessment of the impact of adopting this Standard is in the process of being finalised, but the estimated range of potential impact on the Groups key metrics as at 31 December 2017 is as follows: e Total assets: increase 23% e Total liabilities: increase 57% e Net debt: increase 1219% e Underlying EBITDA: increase 23% e Underlying operating profit: increase marginal e Operating profit: increase marginal e Tax charge: decrease marginal e Profit for the year: decrease marginal e Return on capital employed: decrease 0.40.5 points The following new and amended Standards and Interpretations are also effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2018, and will have no significant impact on the Groups results: e Annual improvements 20142016 cycle e Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property e Amendments to IFRS 2 Share Based Payments e Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts e IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2017 203 1 Mondi Limited parent company statement of financial position as at 31December 2017 ZAR million Notes 2017 2016 Property, plant and equipment 5,497 5,619 Forestry assets 3,863 3,724 Investment in and loans to subsidiaries 2 52 52 Financial asset investments 23 Total non-current assets 9,412 9,418 Inventories 1,039 768 Trade and other receivables 1,781 1,477 Investment in and loans to subsidiaries 2 96 172 Current tax asset 32 Financial asset investments 165 188 Financial instruments 45 5 Cash and cash equivalents 4 1 Total current assets 3,130 2,643 Total assets 12,542 12,061 Short-term borrowings 1,948 1,218 Trade and other payables 1,102 1,111 Current tax liability 86 Provisions 65 59 Total current liabilities 3,201 2,388 Net retirement benefits liability 773 797 Deferred tax liabilities 1,645 1,773 Provisions 2 28 Total non-current liabilities 2,420 2,598 Total liabilities 5,621 4,986 Net assets 6,921 7,075 Equity Stated capital 3 4,188 4,188 Retained earnings and other reserves 2,733 2,887 Total equity 6,921 7,075 Note: 1 The above statement of financial position is an extract of the audited Mondi Limited parent company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.

Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied by Mondi Limited are the same as those presented in notes 1 and 33 to the combined and consolidated Group financial statements, to the extent that the Groups transactions and balances are applicable to the company financial statements.
Principally, the accounting policies which are not directly relevant to Mondi Limited parent company financial statements are those relating to consolidation accounting and the recognition and subsequent measurement of goodwill.
The accounting policy, which is additional to those applied by the Group, is stated as follows: Investments Investments in subsidiaries and associates are reflected at cost less amounts written off and provisions for any impairments.
Any potential impairment is determined on a basis consistent with the accounting policy on the impairment of goodwill.
Accounting estimates and critical judgements The accounting estimates and critical judgements applied by the key management of Mondi Limited are discussed in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements see note 1.

Mondi Limited may not be insured fully, or at all, in respect of such risks.
Mondi Limited cannot predict the outcome of individual legal actions or claims or complaints or investigations.
Mondi Limited may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings prior to a final judgment or determination of liability.
Mondi Limited may do so to avoid the cost, management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing to contest liability, even when it considers it has valid defences to liability.
Mondi Limited considers that no material loss to Mondi Limited is expected to result from these legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations.
Provision is made for all liabilities that are expected to materialise through legal and tax claims against Mondi Limited.
