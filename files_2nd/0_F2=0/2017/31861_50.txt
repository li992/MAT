Exposure to JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A. is the custodian of the Companys assets.

The Depositary, BNY Mellon Trust and Depositary UK Limited, is responsible for the safekeeping of all custodial assets of the Company and for verifying and maintaining a record of all other assets of the Company.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given on the protection of all the assets of the Company.
