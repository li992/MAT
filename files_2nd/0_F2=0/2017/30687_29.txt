Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available, fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
On 29 June 2017, the Company terminated the intercompany oil derivative trade previously entered on 15 April 2016 with a wholly owned subsidiary, in exchange for a termination payment of $40.1 million.
This intercompany transaction does not impact the Groups oil derivative contracts with external counterparties, which it continues to transact and hold in line with the Groups commodity price risk management objectives.

Financial instruments continued The following provides an analysis of the Companys financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All of the Companys derivatives are Level 2 2016: Level 2.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
For financial instruments which are recognised on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest-level input which is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
Income statement summary Derivative fair value movements during the year which have been recognised in the income statement were as follows.
