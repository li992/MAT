INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 105 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year-ended 31 March 2017 1 GENERAL INFORMATION REPORTING ENTITY Sophos Group plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Companys registered office is Sophos Group plc, The Pentagon, Abingdon Science Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, OX14 3YP, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year-ended March 31, 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Group is a leading provider of cloud-enabled enduser and network security solutions 2 APPLICATION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRSs The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective.
The Directors do not anticipate that the IFRSs will have a significant effect on the Groups consolidated financial information: Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2017: Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Amendment to IAS12 Income Taxes Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2018: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Transactions IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Directors have made an assessment of the impact of the standard on the Group based on the final issued version of the standard and the latest authoritative guidance and have concluded that there will be a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial information as a result of the accelerated recognition of certain software revenue where the Group has no remaining vendor obligations and the deferral of commissions, including other direct costs, and rebates in line with the recognition of revenue.
The estimate of this impact on results, had it been effective for the reported periods, is an increase in revenue in FY17 of $3.4 million FY16: $3.0 million and a decrease in operating expenses of $1.2 million FY16: 0.5 million.
Other receivables are estimated to increase by $27.3 million FY16: 24.5 million while deferred revenue would decrease by $24.4 million FY16: 22.6 million.
IFRS 16 LEASES The Directors are still evaluating the impact on the Group of IFRS 16 Leases, which was issued in January 2016 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, which for the Group will be the year-ended 31 March 2020.
The Groups major operating lease expenditure is incurred on property lease rentals as set out in note 35 Commitments and contingent liabilities.
Following adoption of IFRS 16, the Group will recognise a right of use ROU asset and a corresponding financial liability to the lessor based on the present value of future lease payments.
In the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the property lease rentals expenditure will be replaced by amortisation of the ROU asset together with a finance expense.
Alternative performance measures which exclude amortisation, will benefit from the adoption of IFRS 16 through the removal of the leasing charge.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, Net cash flow from operating activities will see an improvement as a result of the amortisation adjustment, with a corresponding increased outflow in Net cash flow from financing activities.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs as they apply to the Group.
106 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2017 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3.2 GOING CONCERN The Group has considerable financial resources together with contracts with a large number of customers and across different geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.
Further information regarding the Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 39.
Further information regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report and the notes to the financial statements.
In addition, note 27 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
3.3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated historical financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention and is presented in US Dollars.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million $M unless otherwise indicated.
The functional currency of Sophos Group plc is US Dollars.
The Group uses US Dollars as its presentation currency to aid comparability of its financial information with that of its peers and the industry: whose information is generally presented in US Dollars.
The accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated historical financial information for the year-ended 31 March 2017 have been consistently applied to all years presented and are set out below.
The historical financial information consolidates the financial information of Sophos Group plc and the entities it controls its subsidiaries at 31 March 2017.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-Group transactions that are recognised in the statement of financial position of the individual reporting entities, are eliminated in full on consolidation.
3.4 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The individual historical financial information of each Group company is prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the historical financial information of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
In preparing the financial information of the individual companies, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.
All exchange differences are taken to the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss, except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 107 On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency US Dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated into US Dollars at the prior month closing rate to that in which the transaction took place because they approximate the rate of exchange at the transaction dates.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of entities whose functional currency is not US Dollars, together with differences arising from the translation of the net results at average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, are taken to equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred accumulated amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
3.5 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY The preparation of historical financial information requires Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the period.
The nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies described in this note, Directors have made the following judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the historical financial information.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Revenue The Group sells software products under fixed term contracts and perpetual licences.
Where there is a multi-element arrangement, the consideration receivable is allocated to each element of the arrangement and this is done on the basis of an estimate of their respective fair values.
In determining the relative fair values of each element, Directors make reference to current prices of individual elements and adjust this by its relative share of discounts applied to the entire sale.
See note 5 Classification of exceptional items and presentation of Non-GAAP measures Directors exercise their judgement in the classification of certain items as exceptional and outside of the Groups underlying results.
The determination of whether an item should be separately disclosed as an exceptional item or other adjustments requires judgement on its materiality, nature and incidence, as well as whether it provides clarity on the Groups underlying trading performance.
In exercising this judgement, Directors take appropriate regard of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements as well as guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council and the European Securities and Market Authority on the reporting of exceptional items and alternative performance measures.
The overall goal of the Directors is to present the Groups underlying performance without distortion from one-off or nontrading events regardless of whether they be favourable or unfavourable to the underlying result.
Further details of the individual exceptional items, and the reasons for their disclosure treatment, are set out in note 7.
Share-based payment transactions The fair value of employee share options issued to third parties are measured using the Black-Scholes model.
Measurement inputs include share price on the measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour, expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate.
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.
The fair value of Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units is equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the day of the grant.
Research and development costs Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy in this note.
Determining the amounts to be capitalised requires Directors to make assumptions regarding the capitalisation criteria requirements of IAS 38 Intangible assets.
108 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2017 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3.5 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED Business combinations Directors are required to make an assessment of the intangible assets to be recognised as a result of the business acquisition.
Furthermore, Directors are required to make an assessment as to whether the intangible assets are separable and their fair values as at the time of acquisition.
This is based on certain assumptions including the expected future cash flows arising from use of the intangibles, discount rates and estimated economic lives of the intangibles.
See note 33 Provisions The Group measures provisions at Directors best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, discounted where the time value of money is considered material.
These estimates take account of available information, historical experience and the likelihood of different possible outcomes.
Both the amount and the maturity of these liabilities could be different from those estimated.
3.6 REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Revenue from software licenses and service contracts The Group sells software products under fixed-term contracts and perpetual licenses.
Where there is multi-element arrangement revenue is allocated to each element on a fair value basis, based on the price at which the respective elements are usually sold separately, regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract.
The portion of the revenue allocated to an element is recognised when the revenue recognition criteria for that element has been met.
Fixed-term contracts Customers who receive software products at the start of the contract under a fixed-term license, are entitled to receive regular updates and upgrades for the duration of the license term which runs for periods ranging from 1 to 5 years.
Revenue for these-fixed rate contracts is recognised rateably over the period that the contractual obligation exists.
Accrued and deferred revenue arising on long-term contracts is included in receivables as accrued income and payables as deferred revenue as appropriate.
Where the Group contracts with an original equipment manufacturer OEM or a service provider, rather than an end user, it mirrors the above policy and recognises the revenue in line with the contractual terms granted to the end user.
Perpetual licenses Revenue is recognised immediately where customers purchase software products under a perpetual license.
Revenue in respect of support and maintenance contracts associated with perpetual licenses is recognised rateably over the life of the support maintenance contract.
Sale of goods Where software licenses and hardware and are sold together, if the software is not essential to the functionality of the tangible product, then the revenue from the sale of goods is recognised immediately.
However, where the software is essential to the functionality of the tangible product and the hardware cannot function without the software, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised rateably over the period of the associated software license contract.
Interest income Interest income is recognised as interest is accrued.
3.7 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 109 Except for freehold land, depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual values of all property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Over the lease period Computer equipment 3 5 years Other plant and equipment 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Fixtures and fittings 6 10 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of the asset is included in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period of fide-recognition.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year-end.
3.8 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
This involves recognising identifiable assets including previously unrecognised intangible assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities and excluding future restructuring of the acquired business at fair value.
Business combinations on or after 1 April 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as goodwill and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 31 March 2004 is recorded at its previous carrying amount under UK GAAP and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Goodwill assets considered significant in comparison to the Companys total carrying amount of such assets have been allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it.
3.9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets is taken to the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred to the extent that the expenditure does not qualify for capitalisation under research and development costs.
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is classified as an intangible asset.
The capitalised costs of software for internal use include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and incremental payroll and payroll-related costs arising from the assignment of employees to implementation projects.
Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended internal use.
110 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2017 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3.9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised over their expected useful lives as follows: Intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries Intellectual property 5 15 years reducing balance basis Brand names 15 20 years reducing balance basis Customer base 6 14 years reducing balance basis Other purchased intangible assets All other intangibles 3 years straight-line basis The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a general finance and administration cost.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least annually.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cashgenerating unit level.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The term of their useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be appropriate.
3.10 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Expenditure on research activities is expensed as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured and technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use.
It is amortised over the period of expected future sales.
Development expenditure incurred on minor or major upgrades, or other changes in software functionalities does not satisfy the criteria, as the product is not substantially new in its design or functional characteristics.
Such expenditure is therefore recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss as incurred.
3.11 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS At least annually, or when otherwise required, Directors review the carrying amounts of the Groups tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money as well as risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not beyond the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as income in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss, although impairment losses relating to goodwill may not be reversed.
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 111 3.12 INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
The cost of raw materials, consumables and goods for resale is based on the purchase cost and is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
3.13 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
When financial instruments are recognised initially they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day payment terms, are carried at original invoice amount, including value added tax and other sales taxes, less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of any outstanding amounts at the period end and on historical performance.
Provision for bad debts is made in the period in which they are identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits repayable in 90 days or less.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and bank deposits net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised at cost, which is deemed to be materially the same as the fair value.
Classification of equity instruments as debt or equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
When equity instruments are issued, any component that creates a financial liability of the Group is presented as a liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position: measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs and thereafter at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or redemption.
The corresponding dividends relating to the liability component are charged as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transactions costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the re-purchase, settlement or other cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
Derivative financial instruments The Group sometimes uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements and interest rate caps to reduce its exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the reporting date.
Changes in the fair values are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss and this is likely to cause volatility in situations where the carrying value of the hedged item is either not adjusted to reflect fair value changes arising from the hedged risk or is so adjusted but that adjustment is not recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
Provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 Financial Instruments are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate this volatility.
112 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2017 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3.14 LEASES Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straightline basis over the lease term.
3.15 PROVISIONS A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance policy, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when recovery is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance expense.
3.16 TAXATION The income tax charge represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from profit reported in the consolidated statement of profit or loss because some items of income or expense are taxable in different periods or may never be taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using UK and foreign rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
A current tax provision is recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation.
Tax liabilities are recognised when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a taxing authority.
They are measured using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach.
The Groups current tax provision relates to the managements judgement of the amount of tax payable on open tax computations where the liabilities remain to be agreed with authorities.
The uncertain tax items for which provision is made, relate to the interpretation of tax legislation impacting arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business.
Due to the uncertainty associated with such items, it is possible that at a future date, on conclusion of open tax matters, the final outcome may vary.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The rate is based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in other comprehensive income or in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 113 enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the income taxes levied in the same taxation authority on either the same entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
3.17 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period in which they become payable.
"3.18 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Employees including senior executives of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments ""equity-settled transactions""."
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in note 30.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
3.19 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Exceptional items are those that in the judgment of the Directors need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, in order to draw the attention of the reader and to show the underlying business performance of the Group more accurately.
Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated financial statements or on the face of the consolidated income statement.
3.20 EVENTS AFTER REPORTING DATE Events between the reporting date and the date the financial statements are approved, favourable and unfavourable, providing evidence of conditions that existed at the reporting date, adjust the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Those that indicate conditions arising after the reporting date are disclosed but are not recognised within the financial statements.
4 SEGMENT INFORMATION For internal management reporting purposes, the primary segment reporting format is determined to be geographic segments as the Group's risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by the different economic environments.
This is consistent with the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group has only one secondary business segment on the basis that the products and services offered to external customers are very similar and therefore do not result in different risks and rates of return for the Group.
The Group's geographical segments are based on the location of the Group's operations consisting of Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA, The Americas and Asia Pacific and Japan APJ.
114 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2017 4 SEGMENT INFORMATION CONTINUED Billings are the value of products and services invoiced to customers after receiving a purchase order from the customer and delivering products and services to them, or for which there is no right to a refund.
Billings does not equate to statutory revenue.
Billings are classified by the geographic location of direct customers, OEMs and the distributors which purchase our products.
The geographic location of OEMs or distributors may be different from that of the end customers.
A disclosure of revenue by region is included in the Financial Review on page 31.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies described in note 3.
Segment profits represent the profit earned by each segment without allocation of central administration costs including Directors salaries, finance costs and income tax expense.
This is the measure reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Chief Executive Officer, and Senior Management Team for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Transfer prices between geographical segments are set on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Geographical segments The following tables present billings, expenditure and certain asset information regarding the Group's geographical segments for the period ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016.

The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures enable a better understanding of the results of the Group and are used as key performance indicators within the business to aid in evaluating its current business performance.
As the measures are not defined by IFRS other companies may calculate them differently or may use such measures for different purposes than the Group does, limiting the usefulness of such measures as a comparative.
Constant currency measures have limitations, particularly as the currency effects that are eliminated may constitute a significant element of the Groups revenue and expenses and could materially impact the Groups performance.
The Directors do not evaluate the Groups results and performance on a constant currency basis without also evaluating the Groups financial information prepared at actual foreign exchange rates in accordance with IFRS.
The definition of non-GAAP measures in the year-ended 31 March 2017 is consistent with those presented for the year-ended 31 March 2016.
However, to ensure such measures remain relevant, the Group regularly reviews their usage and is now proposing a change to the non-GAAP measures that it publishes.
The Directors have updated the key metrics used in the year to enable greater comparability while retaining the key aspects of measures that provide visibility into the fundamental underlying performance of the Group.
Hence in the current year, as explained in the sections below, both the previous and future metrics have been presented to provide some consistency, whilst in future annual reports only details of the revised metrics in use in that period will be disclosed.
The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is set out below.
BILLINGS Billings represent the value of products and services invoiced to customers after receiving a purchase order from the customer and delivering products and services to them, or for which there is no right to a refund.
In previous periods the Group has also reported like-for-like billings which represent billings on a constant currency basis excluding disposals and including acquisitions from the point of acquisition plus the pre-acquisition billings of any acquired companies on a reported basis.
To aid comparability with peer companies the Group will only be using actual rate and constant currency billings in the future.
As like-for-like billings growth has been previously disclosed, and in accordance with best practice for a transition in metric disclosures, the figures for the current and comparative periods are, on this occasion, shown below.

118 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2017 6 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES APMs CONTINUED ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND CASH EBITDA Adjusted operating profit provides a supplemental measure of earnings that facilitates review of operating performance on a period-to-period basis by excluding non-recurring and other items that are not indicative of the Groups underlying operating performance.
Adjusted operating profit is a key profit measure used by the Board to assess the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Adjusted operating profit is stated before the following items for the following reasons Exceptional items, as set out in Note 7, are those items that in the Directors judgment should be disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, in order to show the underlying business performance of the Group more accurately.
Charges for the amortisation of acquired intangibles are excluded from the calculation of adjusted operating profit because these charges are based on judgments about their value and economic life, are the result of the application of acquisition accounting rather than core operations and bear no relation to the Groups underlying ongoing performance.
Share-based payment charges are similarly excluded from the calculation of adjusted operating profit because these represent a non-cash accounting charge for long term incentives to senior management rather than the underlying operations of the Groups business.
On an ongoing basis, the Group will be reporting on adjusted operating profit as it believes that it will improve comparability of the Groups results, while also giving insight into the Groups underlying trading performance.
Cash earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation Cash EBITDA is defined as the Groups operating profit loss adjusted for depreciation and amortisation charges, any gain or loss on the sale of tangible and intangible assets, share option charges, unrealised foreign exchange differences and exceptional items, with billings replacing recognised revenue and is a useful supplemental measure of earnings that provides visibility on actual cash earned in the year.
Depreciation and unrealised foreign exchange differences are adjusted as they do not represent cash costs of the business.

Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate and are separately disclosed on the face of the consolidated income statement within general finance and administration expenses.
During the year-ended 31 March 2017, acquisition related expenses of $7.2M 2016: $1.7M, restructuring and integration costs of $0.4M 2016: $2.6M and costs incurred in relation to the defence and settlement of certain intellectual property IP litigation of $24.6M 2016: $19.8M were incurred.
In the prior-year, Initial Public Offering IPO costs of $17.8M were incurred.
The current-year Intellectual Property litigation costs include an omnibus agreement entered into with Finjan Inc. on 30 March 2017 resolving all the parties disputes.
This resulted in total exceptional items of $31.4M 2016: $41.9M.

Oversight of taxation is within the remit of the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for tax strategy supported by a global team of tax professionals.
Sophos strives for an open and transparent relationship with all revenue authorities.
A tax authority may seek adjustment to the filing position adopted by a Group company and it is accepted that interpretation of complex regulations may lead to additional tax being assessed.
Uncertain tax positions are monitored regularly and a provision made in the accounts where appropriate.
Key influences The Groups tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of profits and reflects a combination of higher rates in certain jurisdictions, such as Germany, a low effective rate in the UK due to available tax losses and rates that lie in between.
The group receives incentives in certain jurisdictions.
In the UK, the Research & Development Expense Credit resulted in a lower tax charge in the income statement and a lower net cash tax payment.
There is no guarantee that these incentives will continue to be applicable in future years.
Expected future rate Over the medium term the tax rate is likely to stabilise as the integration of acquisitions in higher rate jurisdictions are completed.
However, the tax rate may fluctuate if business changes are implemented in response to legislation arising from the OECDs Base Erosion & Profit Shifting Project, the UKs exit from the EU and proposed tax reforms following the US presidential election.
Legislative change in key territories is being monitored and acted upon.
124 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2017 13 TAXATION CONTINUED Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: 31 March 31 March 2017 2016 $M $M Deferred income tax assets in relation to: Deferred revenue 37.1 35.1 Tax value of carry forward losses of UK subsidiaries 15.4 9.3 Tax value of carry forward losses of overseas subsidiaries 13.1 2.3 Advanced capital allowances 6.2 6.7 Share-based payments 19.7 13.7 Other timing differences 13.8 6.8 Total 105.3 73.9 Deferred income tax liabilities in relation to: Intangible assets 14.4 9.6 Other timing differences 0.5 Total 14.4 10.1 Losses A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of losses where current forecasts indicate profits will arise in the foreseeable future against which the losses recognised will be offset.
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of $336.6M 2016: $248.5M available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $118.2M 2016: $54.6M of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining $218.4M 2016: $193.9M unutilised as it is not considered probable that there will be the required type of future trading or non-trading profits available in the correct entities necessary to permit offset and recognition.
Share-based payments A remuneration expense for share based payments is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the period from the award date to the vesting date of the relevant options.
Where there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset may be recorded.
Any deferred tax asset arising on share option awards is calculated as the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future.
This is based on the Groups share price at the reporting date so will be impacted by share price movement and is pro-rated to the extent that the services of the employee have been rendered over the vesting period.
If this amount exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
Similarly, current tax relief in excess of the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate is also recorded in retained earnings.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised in jurisdictions in which future tax deductions are expected.
As at 31 March 2017 the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have been recognised was $Nil 2016: $Nil.
No liability has been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the reversal of temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 125 14 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if all dilutive potential ordinary shares were converted into ordinary shares.
In accordance with IAS 33, the dilutive earnings per share are without reference to adjustments in respect of outstanding shares when the impact would be anti-dilutive.
Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
In the prior-year, adjusted EPS was calculated on the basis of cash EBITDA.
In the current-year, the calculation has been made on the basis of adjusted operating profit, with an equivalent restatement of the comparative number.
This change of basis has been made to ensure better comparability with other UK listed companies.

INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 127 16 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 31 March 31 March 2017 2016 $M $M Americas 253.0 253.5 EMEA 473.2 379.3 APJ 83.1 83.3 809.3 716.1 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually or more frequently where there is indication of impairment.
The goodwill of $96.4M arising on the acquisition of Invincea Inc. on 21 March 2017 has been initially allocated to the EMEA CGU.
Management will re-assess the allocation of goodwill within 12 months from the acquisition date based upon synergies provided to each CGU.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.
For the year-ended 31 March 2017, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors most recent financial forecasts for the following five years.
The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations.
Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2017 are as follows: Americas EMEA APJ % % % Long-term regional growth rate beyond 5 years 2.5% 1.5% 2.0% Discount rate 10.5% 10.0% 11.5% The key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2016 were as follows: Americas EMEA APJ % % % Long-term regional growth rate beyond 5 years 2.5% 1.5% 2.0% Discount rate 11.0% 10.0% 12.0% As at 31 March 2017, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Groups long-lived assets are not recoverable.

27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk management is conducted at a Group level, applying treasury policies which have been approved by the Board.
The major financial risks to which the Group is exposed relate to interest rate risk, credit risk and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
Where appropriate, cost effective and practicable, the Group uses various financial instruments to manage these risks.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to reduce the impact on the Group operations of changes in market rates.
No speculative use of derivatives, currency or other instruments is permitted.
The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below: Liquidity risk The Group prepares budgets annually in advance.
This enables the Group's operating cash flow requirements to be anticipated and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs, financial obligations and to invest any surplus cash assets safely and profitably.
Quarterly covenant tests are performed and monitored by the Directors at quarterly board meetings.
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding, minimising finance costs and maintaining flexibility through the use of short-term deposits and intra-group loan arrangements.
Capital management The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholders' value.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 21, borrowings as disclosed in note 25 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
The Group reviews the capital structure on a regular basis and considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Credit risk The Group's principal financial assets are cash and bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
In order to manage credit risk the Directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references.
Credit limits are reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of allowance for doubtful debts.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The expense recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in respect of doubtful debts during the period was $0.1M, as disclosed in note 21.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in trade receivables: exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
With respect to cash and deposits, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from the risk of default by the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these assets.
To mitigate this risk, cash and deposits are only held with reputable banking institutions.
The Group reduces the concentrations of credit risk in cash and deposits by holding balances with a number of separate institutions.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to the long-term debt obligations with floating rates of interest.
136 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2017 27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Interest rate sensitivity A change of 100 basis points in market interest rates would have increased decreased equity and profit and loss by the amounts shown below.
Year-ended Year-ended 31 March 31 March 2017 2016 $M $M Increase in interest rates 3.1 2.3 Decrease in interest rates 3.1 2.3 Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk.
Several other currencies in addition to the reporting currency of US Dollar are used, including Sterling and the Euro.
The Group experiences currency exchange differences arising upon retranslation of monetary items primarily short-term inter-company balances and longterm borrowings, which are recognised as an expense in the period the difference occurs.
The Group endeavours to match the cash inflows and outflows in the various currencies: the Group typically invoices its customers in their local currency, and pays its local expenses in local currency as a means to mitigate this risk.
The Group is also exposed to exchange differences arising from the translation of its subsidiaries' financial statements into the Group's reporting currency of US Dollar with the corresponding exchange differences taken directly to equity.
The following table illustrates the movement that 10% in the value of Sterling or the Euro would have had on the Groups profit or loss for the period and on the Groups equity as at the end of the period.

Share-based payment expense The expense recognised for employee services received during the year is as follows: Year-ended Year-ended 31 March 31 March 2017 2016 $M $M Cash-settled transactions 1.2 1.3 Equity-settled transactions 31.3 15.0 Total share-based payment expense 32.5 16.3 The cash-settled expense comprises cash-based awards together with certain social security taxes.
The carrying value of the liability as at 31 March 2017 was $1.8M 2016: $1.1M.
SHARE OPTIONS The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The following table illustrates the weighted average inputs into the Black-Scholes model in the year: Year-ended Year-ended 31 March 31 March 2017 2016 Weighted average share price $ Cents 291.00 130.63 Weighted average exercise price $ Cents 234.00 130.63 Expected volatility 42.40% 32.66% Expected life of options years 3.20 2.28 Risk free rate 0.92% 0.57% Dividend yield 0.62% Nil The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was $ cents 51.75 2016 $ cents 24.4 The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical share price volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
An increase in the expected volatility will increase the estimated fair value.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on Directors best estimate, taking into account the effects of exercise restrictions, non-transferability and behavioural considerations.
An increase in the expected life will increase the estimated fair value.

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
