John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 87 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 1 GENERAL INFORMATION The results of John Laing Group plc the Company or the Group are stated according to the basis of preparation described below.
The registered office of the Company is 1 Kingsway, London, WC2B 6AN.
The principal activity of the Company is the origination, investment in and management of international infrastructure projects.
The financial information is presented in pounds sterling and prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of the investment portfolio and other financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The Company has concluded that it meets the denition of an investment entity as set out in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, paragraph 27 on the following basis: i as an entity listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Company is owned by a number of investors: ii the Company holds a substantial portfolio of investments in project companies through intermediate holding companies.
The underlying projects have a nite life and the Company has an exit strategy for its investments which is either to hold them to maturity or, if appropriate, to divest them.
Investments take the form of equity and or subordinated debt: iii the Groups strategy is to originate, invest in, and manage infrastructure assets.
It invests in PPP and renewable energy projects and aims to deliver predictable returns and consistent growth from its investment portfolio.
The underlying project companies have businesses and activities that the Group is not directly involved in.
The Group's returns from the provision of management services are small in comparison to the Groups overall investment-based returns: and iv the Group measures its investments in PPP and renewable energy projects on a fair value basis.
Information on the fair value of investments forms part of monthly management reports reviewed by the Groups Executive Committee, who are considered to be the Groups key management personnel, and by its Board of Directors.
Although the Group has a net dened benefit pension liability, IFRS 10 does not exclude companies with non-investment related liabilities from qualifying as investment entities.
Investment entities are required to account for all investments in controlled entities, as well as investments in associates and joint ventures, at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, except for those directly owned subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage in permitted investment related activities with investees Service Companies.
Service Companies are consolidated rather than recorded at FVTPL.
Project companies in which the Group invests are described as non-recourse, which means that providers of debt to such project companies do not have recourse to John Laing beyond its equity and or subordinated debt commitments in the underlying projects.
Subsidiaries through which the Company holds its investments in project companies, which are held at FVTPL, and subsidiaries that are Service Companies, which are consolidated, are described as recourse.
Unconsolidated project company subsidiaries are part of the non-recourse business.
Based on arrangements in place with those subsidiaries, the Group has concluded that there are no: a significant restrictions resulting from borrowing arrangements, regulatory requirements or contractual arrangements on the ability of an unconsolidated subsidiary to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans or advances made to the unconsolidated subsidiary by the Group: and b current commitments or intentions to provide financial or other support to an unconsolidated subsidiary, including commitments or intentions to assist the subsidiary in obtaining financial support, beyond the Groups original investment commitment.
Transactions and balances receivable or payable between recourse subsidiary entities held at fair value and those that are consolidated are eliminated in the Group financial statements.
Transactions and balances receivable or payable between non-recourse project companies held at fair value and recourse entities that are consolidated are not eliminated in the Group financial statements.
For details of the subsidiaries that are consolidated, see note 13 to the Company financial statements.
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 88 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Adoption of new and revised standards The Group has adopted the following amendments to IFRS in 2017, none of which has had a material impact on the financial statements with the exception of the Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Disclosure Initiative which has led the Group to present a reconciliation of the changes in liabilities arising from nancing activities.
This reconciliation can be found on note 24 of the Group financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities included in Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, there are a number of standards and interpretations which are in issue but not yet effective and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU.
These include: Issued and endorsed by the EU IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle The Groups principal revenue stream is net gain on investments held at FVTPL, which is accounted for under IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement rather than IFRS 15.
The Groups other revenue stream is other income comprising fees from asset management services and recovery of bid costs on financial close.
The Group does not expect IFRS 15 to have a material impact on the accounting for these revenue streams.
The adoption of IFRS 16 will require the Group to bring its operating leases on to the Group Balance Sheet.
The Group does not have material operating leases total outstanding commitments under operating leases at 31 December 2017 are 6.4 million and therefore adopting the standard is not expected to have a significant impact.
It is not expected that IFRS 9, when it becomes effective, will have a significant impact on the measurement of the Groups financial assets and liabilities as the Groups principal financial assets are investments held at fair value through profit or loss which are not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 also changes the classication of financial assets and implements new rules around hedge accounting.
The Group does not have any financial assets whose classication will be impacted by adoption of IFRS 9 nor does it apply hedge accounting to any of its derivatives.
Issued and not endorsed by the EU Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS 2015-2017 Cycle Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.
While the Group is still undertaking an assessment of the impact of the new standards, it is not anticipated that they will have a material impact on the Group.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Group financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to each of the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 89 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Going concern The Directors have reviewed the Groups financial projections and cash ow forecasts and believe, based on those projections and forecasts, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on the going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion, the Directors took into account the Groups approach to liquidity and cash ow management and the availability of its 475 million corporate banking facilities committed until March 2020, together with the additional 50 million of liquidity facilities committed until February 2019.
The Directors are of the opinion that, based on the Groups forecasts and projections and taking into account expected bidding activity and operational performance, the Group will be able to operate within its bank facilities and comply with the financial covenants therein for the foreseeable future.
In determining that the Group is a going concern, certain risks and uncertainties, some of which arise or increase as a result of the economic environment in some of the Groups markets, have been considered.
The Directors believe that the Group is adequately placed to manage these risks.
The most important risks and uncertainties identied and considered by the Directors are set out in the Principal Risks and Risk Management section.
In addition, the Group's policies for management of its exposure to financial risks, including liquidity, foreign exchange, credit, price and interest rate risks are set out in note 17. d Revenue The key accounting policies for the Groups material revenue streams are as follows: i Dividend income Dividend income from investments at FVTPL is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established provided that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Dividend income is recognised gross of withholding tax, if any, and only when approved and paid.
ii Net gain on investments at FVTPL Net gain on investments at FVTPL excludes dividend income referred to above.
Please refer to accounting policy f i for further detail.
iii Other income Fees from asset management services Fees from asset management services to projects in which the Group invests and to external parties are recognised as the services are provided in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
When it is probable that the expected outcome over the life of a management services contract will result in a net outow of economic benets or overall loss, a provision is recognised immediately.
The provision is determined based on the net present value of the expected future cash inows and outows.
Recovery of bid costs on financial close Costs incurred in respect of bidding for new primary investments are charged to the Group Income Statement until such time as the Group is virtually certain that it will recover the costs.
Virtual certainty is generally achieved when an agreement is in place demonstrating that costs are fully recoverable even in the event of cancellation of a project.
From the point of virtual certainty, bid costs are held in the Group Balance Sheet as a debtor prior to achieving financial close.
On financial close, the Group recovers bid costs by charging a fee to the relevant project company in the investment portfolio.
Other income excludes VAT and the value of intra-group transactions between recourse subsidiaries held at FVTPL and those that are consolidated.
e Dividend payments Dividends on the Companys ordinary shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Companys discretion.
Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Companys AGM.
Dividends are recognised as an appropriation of shareholders funds.
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 90 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED f Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
i Financial assets All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classied as at FVTPL, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classied into the following specified categories: cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at FVTPL: held-to-maturity investments: available-for-sale financial assets: or loans and receivables.
The classication depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
The financial assets that the Group holds are classied as financial assets at FVTPL, loans and receivables and cash and cash equivalents: Financial assets at FVTPL comprise the Groups investment in John Laing Holdco Limited through which the Group indirectly holds its investments in projects which is valued based on the fair value of investments in project companies, the Groups investment in JLEN and other assets and liabilities of investment entity subsidiaries.
Investments in project companies and in JLEN are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at FVTPL.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments in project companies are measured on a combined basis at fair value principally using discounted cash flow methodology.
The investment in JLEN is valued at the quoted market price at the end of the period.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of other assets and liabilities held in investment entity subsidiaries approximates to their fair value, with the exception of derivatives which are measured in accordance with accounting policy f v. Changes in the fair value of the Groups investment in John Laing Holdco Limited are recognised within operating income in the Group Income Statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Loans and receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
The Group's loans and receivables comprise 'trade and other receivables' in the Group Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.
Deposits held with original maturities of greater than three months are shown as other financial assets.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 91 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED ii Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash ows of the investment have been affected.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss.
iii Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
iv Financial liabilities Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the proceeds received net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Group Income Statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
v Derivative financial instruments The Group treats forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swap deals it enters into as derivative financial instruments at FVTPL.
All the Groups derivative financial instruments are held by subsidiaries which are recorded at FVTPL and consequently the fair value of derivatives is incorporated into investments held at FVTPL.
g Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outow will be required on settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
h Finance costs Finance costs relating to the corporate banking facilities, other than set-up costs, are recognised in the year in which they are incurred.
Set-up costs are recognised over the remaining facility term.
Finance costs also include the net interest cost on retirement benefit obligations and the unwinding of discounting of provisions.
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 92 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED i Taxation The tax charge or credit represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Group Income Statement because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible, which includes the fair value movement on the investment in John Laing Holdco Limited.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Group Income Statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
j Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group subsidiary that is consolidated i. e. a Service Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purposes of the financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group subsidiary are expressed in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the financial statements.
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency including investments measured at fair value are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any difference arising on the retranslation of these amounts is taken to the Group Income Statement with foreign exchange movements on investments measured at fair value recognised in operating income as part of net gain on investments at FVTPL.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
k Retirement benefit costs The Group operates both dened benefit and dened contribution pension arrangements.
Its two dened benefit pension schemes are the John Laing Pension Fund JLPF and the John Laing Pension Plan, which are both closed to future accrual.
The Group also provides post-retirement medical benets to certain former employees.
Payments to dened contribution pension arrangements are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For the dened benefit pension schemes and the post-retirement medical benefit scheme, the cost of providing benets is determined in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benets revised using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at least every three years.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur and are presented in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Curtailment gains arising from changes to members benets are recognised in full in the Group Income Statement.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group Balance Sheet represent the present value of: i dened benefit scheme obligations as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets, where any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs plus the present value of available refunds: and ii unfunded post-retirement medical benets.
Net interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs.
l Leasing All leases are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 93 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED m Share capital Ordinary shares are classied as equity instruments on the basis that they evidence a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds in the period in which the shares are issued.
n Employee benefit trust In June 2015, the Group established the John Laing Group Employee benefit Trust EBT as described further in note 6.
The Group is deemed to have control of the EBT and it is therefore treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the accounts.
Any investment by the EBT in the Companys shares is deducted from equity in the Group Balance Sheet as if such shares were treasury shares.
No investment was made in the year.
Other assets and liabilities of the EBT are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Group.
Any shares held by the EBT are excluded for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The key areas of the financial statements where the Group is required to make critical judgements and material accounting estimates which are those estimates where there is a risk of material adjustment in the next reporting period are in respect of the fair value of investments and accounting for the Groups defined benefit pension liabilities.
Fair value of investments Critical accounting judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies The Company measures its investment in John Laing Holdco Limited at fair value.
Fair value is determined based on the fair value of investments in project companies and the Groups investment in JLEN together the Groups investment portfolio and other assets and liabilities of investment entity subsidiaries.
A full valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is prepared on a consistent, principally discounted cash flow basis at 30 June and 31 December.
The key inputs, therefore, to the valuation of each investment are i the discount rate: and ii the cash flows forecast to be received from such investment.
Under the Groups valuation methodology, a base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points.
The base case discount rate is then adjusted to reflect additional project-specific risks.
In addition, risk premia are added to reflect the additional risk during the construction phase.
The construction risk premia reduce over time as the project progresses through its construction programme, reflecting the significant reduction in risk once the project reaches the operational stage.
The valuation excluding the investment in JLEN assumes that forecast cash flows are received until maturity of the underlying assets.
The cash flows on which the discounted cash flow valuation is based are those forecast to be distributable to the Group at each balance sheet date, derived from detailed project financial models.
These incorporate a number of assumptions with respect to individual assets, including: dates for construction completion: value enhancements: the terms of project debt refinancing where applicable : the outcome of any disputes: the level of volume-based revenue: future rates of inflation and, for renewable energy projects, energy yield and future energy prices.
Value enhancements are only incorporated when the Group has sufficient evidence that they can be realised.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty A key source of estimation uncertainty in valuing the investment portfolio is the discount rate applied to forecast project cash flows.
A base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points.
The base case discount rate is then adjusted to reflect project-specific risks.
In addition, risk premia are added during the construction phase to reflect the additional risks throughout construction.
These premia reduce over time as the project progresses through its construction programme, reflecting the significant reduction in risk once the project reaches the operational stage.
The discount rates applied to investments at 31 December 2017 were in the range of 6.8% to 11.8% 31 December 2016 7.0% to 11.6%.
Note 17 provides details of the weighted average discount rate applied to the investment portfolio as a whole and sensitivities to the investment portfolio value from changes in discount rates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty present in the forecast cash flows to be received from investments are the forecasts of future energy prices on renewable energy projects and forecasts for long-term inflation.
Note 17 provides details of the sensitivities to the investment portfolio value from changes in forecast energy prices and forecast long-term inflation.
The Group does not consider the other factors that affect cash flows, as described in the critical accounting judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies above, to be key sources of estimation uncertainty.
They are based either on reliable data or the Groups experience and individually not considered likely to materially deviate year on year.
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 94 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED Pension and other post-retirement liability accounting Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies The combined accounting deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical schemes at 31 December 2017 was 40.3 million 31 December 2016 69.3 million.
In determining the Groups defined benefit pension liability, consideration is also given to whether there is a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction which is in excess of the IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability.
If the minimum funding requirement is higher, an additional liability would need to be recognised.
Under the trust deed and rules of JLPF, the Group has an ultimate unconditional right to any surplus, accordingly the excess of the minimum funding requirement over the IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability has not been recognised as an additional liability.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The value of the pension deficit is highly dependent on key assumptions including price inflation, discount rate and life expectancy.
The assumptions applied at 31 December 2017 and the sensitivity of the pension liabilities to certain changes in these assumptions are illustrated in note 19.
4 OPERATING SEGMENTS Information is reported to the Group's Board the chief operating decision maker under IFRS 8 Operating Segments for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance based on the category of activities undertaken within the Group.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the principal categories of activity, and thus the reportable segments under IFRS 8, were: Primary Investment, Secondary Investment and Asset Management.
The results included within each of the reportable segments comprise: Primary Investment costs and cost recoveries associated with originating, bidding for and winning greenfield PPP and renewable energy infrastructure projects: investment returns from and growth in the value of the Primary Investment portfolio, net of associated costs.
Secondary Investment investment returns from and growth in the value of the Secondary Investment portfolio, net of associated costs.
Asset Management fee income and associated costs from investment management services in respect of both the Primary and Secondary Investment portfolios and in respect of JLIF's and JLEN's portfolios and the PPP assets in JLPFs portfolio plus fee income and associated costs from project management services.
The Board's primary measure of profitability for each segment is profit before tax.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Board did not monitor on an ongoing basis the results of the Group on a geographical basis.
An analysis of the Groups investments at FVTPL by foreign currency can be found in note 17.

The operating income from the three investments was 36.1 million, 37.3 million and 27.5 million, all of which was reported within the Primary Investment sector.
The Group treats each investment in a project company as a separate customer for the purpose of IFRS 8.
The Group's investment portfolio, comprising investments in project companies and a listed fund included within investments at FVTPL see note 12 is allocated between primary and secondary investments.
The Primary Investment portfolio includes investments in projects which are in the construction phase.
The Secondary Investment portfolio includes investments in operational projects.

Awards are conditional on the relevant employee completing three years' service the vesting period.
The awards vest three years from the grant date, subject to the Group achieving a target market-based performance condition, total shareholder return 50% of the award, and a non-market based performance condition, NAV per share growth 50% of the award.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the awards in cash.

The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For the parent company and its recourse subsidiaries, financial risks are managed by a central treasury operation which operates within Board approved policies.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk As at 31 December 2017 the Group held investments in 31 overseas projects 31 December 2016 26 overseas projects all of which are fair valued based on the spot rate at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 spot rate at 31 December 2016.
The Group's foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies: it may then enter into hedges against certain individual investments.
The Group's exposure to exchange rate risk on its investments is disclosed below.
In addition, the Groups policy on managing foreign currency exchange rate risk is to cover significant transactional exposures arising from receipts and payments in foreign currencies, where appropriate and cost effective.
There were eight forward currency contracts open as at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 21.
The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 1.3 million 31 December 2016 net asset of 3.5 million and is included in investments at FVTPL.
At 31 December 2017, the Group's most significant currency exposure was to the US dollar 31 December 2016 Euro.

As at 31 December 2017, a 5% movement of each relevant currency against Sterling would decrease or increase the value of investments in overseas projects by c. 38 million.
The Groups profit before tax would be impacted by the same amounts.
There would be no additional impact on equity.
Market risk interest rate risk The Group's interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of returns from floating rate deposits and expose the Group to variability in interest payment cash flows on variable rate borrowings.
The Group has assessed its exposure to interest rate risk and considers that this exposure is low as its variable rate borrowings tend to be short term, its finance costs in relation to letters of credit issued under the corporate banking facilities are at a fixed rate and the interest earned on its cash and cash equivalents minimal.
The exposure of the Group's financial assets to interest rate risk is as follows: 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Interest bearing Non-interest Interest bearing Non-interest floating rate bearing Total floating rate bearing Total million million million million million million Financial assets Investments at FVTPL 1,346.4 1,346.4 1,257.5 1,257.5 Trade and other receivables 6.9 6.9 7.0 7.0 Cash and cash equivalents 0.5 2.0 2.5 1.6 1.6 Financial assets exposed to interest rate risk 0.5 1,355.3 1,355.8 1,266.1 1,266.1 An analysis of the movement between opening and closing balances of investments at FVTPL is given in note 12.
Investments in project companies are principally valued on a discounted cash flow basis.
At 31 December 2017, the weighted average discount rate was 8.8% 31 December 2016 8.9%.
For investments in project companies, changing the discount rate used to value the underlying instruments would alter their fair value.
As at 31 December 2017 a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 40.7 million 31 December 2016 32.1 million and a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase the fair value by 42.6 million 31 December 2016 33.6 million.
The exposure of the Group's financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 Interest bearing Non-interest Interest bearing Non-interest fixed rate bearing Total fixed rate bearing Total million million million million million million Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 173.2 173.2 161.4 161.4 Trade and other payables 16.5 16.5 13.0 13.0 Total financial liabilities 173.2 16.5 189.7 161.4 13.0 174.4 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 106 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2017 17 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Market risk inflation risk The Group has limited direct exposure to inflation risk, but the fair value of investments is determined by future project revenue and costs which can be partly linked to inflation.
Sensitivity to inflation can be mitigated by the project company entering into inflation swaps.
Where PPP investments are positively correlated to inflation, an increase in inflation expectations will tend to increase the value of PPP investments.
However, all other things being equal, an increase in inflation expectations would also tend to increase JLPF's pension liabilities.
Based on a sample of six of the larger PPP investments by value at 31 December 2017, a 0.25% increase in inflation is estimated to increase the value of PPP investments by c. 15 million and a 0.25% decrease in inflation is estimated to decrease the value of PPP investment by c. 14 million.
Certain of the underlying project companies incorporate some inflation hedging.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis and arises from a combination of the value and term to settlement of balances due and payable by counterparties for both financial and trade transactions.
In order to minimise credit risk, cash investments and derivative transactions are limited to financial institutions of a suitable credit quality and counterparties are carefully screened.
The Group's cash balances are invested in line with a policy approved by the Board, capped with regard to counter-party credit ratings.
A significant number of the project companies in which the Group invests receive revenue from government departments, public sector or local authority clients and or directly from the public.
As a result, these projects tend not to be exposed to significant credit risk.
Price risk The Groups investments in PPP assets have limited direct exposure to price risk.
The fair value of many such project companies is dependent on the receipt of fixed fee income from government departments, public sector or local authority clients.
As a result, these projects tend not to be exposed to price risk.
The Group also holds investments in renewable energy projects whose fair value may vary with forecast energy prices to the extent they are not economically hedged through short to medium-term fixed price purchase agreements with electricity suppliers, or do not benefit from governmental support mechanisms at fixed prices.
At 31 December 2017, based on a sample of seven of the larger renewable energy investments by value, a 5% increase in power price forecasts is estimated to increase the value of renewable energy investments by 15 million and a 5% decrease in power price forecasts is estimated to decrease the value of renewable energy investments by 14 million.
The Groups investment in JLEN is valued at its closing market share price at 31 December 2017.
Liquidity risk The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its current and upcoming obligations.
The Group's liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and assessing the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.

JLPF was closed to future accrual from 1 April 2011 and the Plan was closed to future accrual from September 2003.
Neither Scheme has any active members, only deferred members and pensioners.
The assets of both Schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
UK staff employed since 1 January 2002, who are entitled to retirement benefits, can choose to be members of a defined contribution stakeholder scheme sponsored by the Group in conjunction with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited.
Local defined contribution arrangements are available to overseas staff.
JLPF An actuarial valuation of JLPF was carried out as at 31 March 2016 by a qualified independent actuary, Willis Towers Watson.
At that date, JLPF was 85% funded on the technical provision funding basis.
This valuation took into account the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMI Bureau projections of mortality.
The Group agreed to repay the actuarial deficit of 171.0 million at 31 March 2016 over seven years as follows: By 31 March million 2017 24.5 2018 26.5 2019 29.1 2020 24.9 2021 25.7 2022 26.4 2023 24.6 The next triennial actuarial valuation of JLPF is due as at 31 March 2019.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, John Laing made deficit reduction contributions of 24.5 million 2016 18.1 million in cash.
At 31 December 2017, JLPF's assets included PPP investments valued at nil 31 December 2016 37.8 million.
The liability at 31 December 2017 allows for indexation of deferred pensions and post 5 April 1988 GMP pension increases based on the Consumer Price Index CPI.
The Plan No contributions were made to the Plan in the year ended 31 December 2017 2016 none.
At its last actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2017, the Plan had assets of 13.1 million and liabilities of 12.0 million resulting in an actuarial surplus of 1.1 million.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Plan is due as at 31 March 2020.

The impact of possible future changes to some of the assumptions is shown below, without taking into account any inter-relationship between the assumptions.
In practice, there would be inter-relationships between the assumptions.
The analysis has been prepared in conjunction with the Group's actuarial adviser.
The Group considers that the changes below are reasonably possible based on recent experience.

Mortality assumptions at 31 December 2016 were based on the following tables published by the CMI Bureau: SAPS S2 normal S2NA year of birth tables for staff members with mortality improvements in line with CMI 2015 core projections with a long-term trend rate of 1.25% per annum and SAPS S2 light S2NA L year of birth tables for executive members with mortality improvements in line with CMI 2016 core projections with a long-term trend rate of 1.25% per annum.

Derivatives can be classified as Level 2 instruments and property and UK PPP investments as Level 3 instruments.
It is the policy of JLPF to use inflation swaps to hedge its exposure to inflation risk.
The JLPF Trustee invests in return seeking assets, such as equity and property, whilst balancing the risks of inflation and interest rate movements through the annuity buy-in agreement, inflation swaps and interest rate hedging.
In late 2008, the JLPF Trustee entered into a bulk annuity buy-in agreement with Aviva to mitigate JLPF's exposure to changes in liabilities.
At 31 December 2017, the underlying insurance policy was valued at 231.0 million 31 December 2016 234.1 million, being very substantially equal to the IAS 19 valuation of the related liabilities.
The pension liability of 32.3 million at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 61.3 million is net of a surplus under IAS 19 of 2.9 million in the Plan 31 December 2016 2.9 million.
