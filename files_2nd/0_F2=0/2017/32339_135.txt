Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 14. Business combinations continued increase in provisions related to unfavourable contracts in the amount of 20m.
The net impact of the adjustment including the deferred tax effect resulted in an increase of 29m in goodwill with no material impact on the income statement for the period ended 31 March 2016.
In the prior year, we provisionally paid 3,464m of cash and issued 1,595m of new shares valued at 7,507m using the opening share price of 470.7p per share on 29 January 2016, being the date of acquisition of EE and the date when the shares were admitted to trading.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
For the acquisition of EE this amounted to 6,430m.
The fair values ascribed and the resulting goodwill were recognised on a provisional basis which the group had one year from the acquisition date to re-measure.
As discussed above we completed this in 2016 17 resulting in an increase of 29m in goodwill.

a We have revised prior year information to be on a consistent basis.
Trade and other receivables Weve made various judgements in accounting for trade and other receivables.
These include long-term contracts and bad debt provisions.
Long-term customer contracts Long-term customer contracts can extend over a number of financial years.
During the contractual period recognition of costs and profits may be impacted by judgements and estimates made.
What critical judgements have we made?
Weve exercised judgement in assessing when the transition or transformation phase of a contract ends.
This influences the timing of recognition of revenue and costs which are deferred until the transition or transformation phase ends unless these elements of a contract have standalone value.
Judgements are also required in assessing the lifetime profitability of a contract when determining whether we have an onerous contract liability.
Where we have an onerous contract liability this would be classified in provisions.

Trade and other receivables continued How do we estimate and recognise contract losses?
We estimate and recognise immediately the entire estimated loss for a contract when we have evidence that the contract is unprofitable.
Also if these estimates indicate that any contract will be less profitable than previously forecast, contract assets may have to be written down to the extent they are no longer considered to be fully recoverable.
We perform ongoing profitability reviews of our contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates are appropriate.
Key factors reviewed include: Transaction volumes or other inputs affecting future revenues which can vary depending on customer requirements, plans, market position and other factors such as general economic conditions.
Our ability to achieve key contract milestones connected with the transition, development, transformation and deployment phases for customer contracts.
The status of commercial relations with customers and the implication for future revenue and cost projections.
Our estimates of future staff and third-party costs and the degree to which cost savings and efficiencies are deliverable.
The carrying value of assets comprising the costs of the initial set-up, transition or transformation phase of long-term networked IT services contracts is disclosed below.

How do we assess recoverability of our receivables?
We provide services to consumer and business customers, mainly on credit terms.
We know that certain debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number of our customers.
Judgements are required in assessing the recoverability of trade receivables and whether a provision for doubtful debts may be required.
In estimating a provision for doubtful debts we consider historical experience alongside other factors such as the current state of the economy and particular industry issues.
The value of the provision for doubtful debts is disclosed above.
Trade receivables are continuously monitored and allowances applied against trade receivables consist of both specific impairments and collective impairments based on our historical loss experiences for the relevant aged c ategory as well as taking into account general economic conditions.
Historical loss experience allowances are calculated by line of busine ss in order to reflect the specific nature of the customers relevant to that line of business.
