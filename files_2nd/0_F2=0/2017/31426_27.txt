4.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is measured on acquisition as the excess of the aggregate of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and in the case of business combinations achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the initial amount of goodwill is negative, the amount is recognised in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the cash-generating units CGUs may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
The impairment test requires the Group to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the CGU to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell is generally measured using an earnings multiple approach using revenue and EBITA multiples obtained from comparable businesses and transactions.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is allocated and monitored by management at a CGU level, consisting of the three business units operating across the Groups operating segments.
Not all business units are active in all segments: there are six CGUs at 31 December 2017 2016: seven CGUs.
During the year, Online and Print were merged into one CGU, Other Marketing Services.
This reflects the lowest level cash flows are monitored at as products are similar with shared revenue characteristics subscriptions, advertising and directories and shared cost bases.
Following the acquisition of Allworld, a new CGU UBM Allworld Events was recognised, however, this will be merged into UBM Asia from 2018 onwards.
For reporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into the reportable segments, as shown in the tables below.
The CGUs are individually tested for impairment each year.

The carrying amount of goodwill attributed to these CGUs at 31 December 2017 was 929.5m, 223.3m, 88.6m and 228.8m respectively.
In 2016, UBM Americas Events 1,007.5m, UBM EMEA Events 225.5m and UBM Asia Events 344.5m were considered significant.

The following key assumptions were used by management in the value in use calculations: Pre-tax Perpetuity discount growth rate rate % % Cash flow forecasts Events 2017: 11.7 13.0 2017: 1.4 2.8 Event revenue is expected to continue to grow with continued focus on the Events First strategy and organic growth in major 2016: 11.2 11.7 2016: 2.4 2.7 events.
Other Marketing Services 2017: 11.0 13.3 2017: 0.0 3.1 The continued rebalancing of the product portfolio, away from print to digital.
2016: 10.1 11.2 2016: 2.9 3.1 Focus on the management of cost base as revenue growth slows.
Forecast cash flows For each CGU, the forecast cash flows for the first three years are based on the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management.
The forecast cash flows are based on assumptions that reflect past experience, forward booking indicators, long term trends, industry forecasts and growth rates and management estimates see above.
For each CGU, the forecast cash flows beyond the first three years are based upon the weighted average projected real gross domestic product growth rate in 2020 of each of the territories in which the CGUs operate.
Growth rates for each territory have been based on contribution to 2018 budgeted adjusted operating profit 2016: contribution to 2017 adjusted operating profit.
The growth rates used in the value in use calculation for OMS range from 0.0% to 3.1%.
In 2016 when the Print and Online CGUs were separate, the growth rate range was 2.9% 3.1%.
The negative growth rate related to Print and reflected the territories and industries in which the CGU operated.
Discount rate The discount rate for each CGU is based on a blended model of the current yield on long term government bonds and longer term expected yields, the systemic risk of the specific CGU and taking into account the relative size of the CGU and the specific territories in which it operates.
The increased risk of investing in equities is assessed using an equity market risk premium which reflects the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the whole market.
The equity market risk premium used is based on studies by independent economists and historical equity market risk premiums.
The risk adjustment for the systematic risk, beta, of the CGU reflects the risks specific to the CGU for which the forecast cash flows have not been adjusted.
The adjustment to the rate has been determined by management using an average of the betas of comparable companies within respective sectors.
Sensitivities Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the estimated recoverable amount of UBM Americas Print was not significantly higher than its carrying amount.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 118 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 4.2 Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets acquired separately including website development costs relating to the application and infrastructure development, graphical design and content development stages incurred with third parties are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised in accordance with the accounting policy for acquisitions Note 6.1 and measured on initial recognition at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Internally generated intangible assets, including internally generated software, that do not qualify for recognition as an intangible asset under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense.
All research costs are expensed as incurred.
At each reporting date, intangible assets are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition less amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives as follows: Trademarks brands 525 years Software 57 years Customer contracts and relationships 110 years Subscription lists 25 years Databases 210 years Website development costs 3 years Following the completion of the purchase price allocation for Allworld Exhibitions, based on expert external advice which considered the longevity and strength of certain Allworld brands, the useful economic life of certain Allworld brands was estimated to be 25 years.
Accordingly, the existing Group policy for brands has been updated from a range of 5 to 15 years, to be 5 to 25 years.
Useful lives are re-examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The amortisation of internally generated or purchased software and website development costs is included in operating expenses in the income statement.
The amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions is included as a separate line item in the income statement as it does not relate to operating activities.

4.3 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all items except freehold land.
Depreciation rates are calculated so that assets are written down to the residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property Up to 70 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease General plant, machinery and equipment 520 years Computer equipment 35 years Motor vehicles 35 years An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the item is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

See Note 5.7 on credit risk of trade receivables, which explains how the Group manages and measures credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired.
2 Trade and other payables Accounting policy Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
Trade and other payables are measured at original cost, which approximates to their fair value.

If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Management reassesses the amounts of these provisions at each balance sheet date in order to ensure that they are measured at the current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the current estimates is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

The amounts recorded in the above tables are continually evaluated by management.
Reorganisation and restructuring The provision mainly relates to the remaining severance payments to be made in relation to the restructuring of the Advanstar integration.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next 12 months.
Vacant properties The provisions relate to obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property.
The quantification of the provisions depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet the properties.
The provisions also relate to obligations in respect of dilapidations on leasehold properties.
The quantification of these provisions are dependent on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases.
The provisions at 31 December 2017 have been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases, which range from one to ten years.
The provision is discounted at an appropriate cost of capital.
Liabilities relating to disposals The provisions relate to obligations arising from warranty and other claims brought against the Group in relation to disposed businesses over periods of up to seven years after the date of disposal.
The decrease in the provision is primarily due to the release of warranties and indemnities recognised in accordance with specific clauses in the sale agreement of PR Newswire.
The provision in respect of these items has been determined based upon the contract terms of each disposal and are reassessed on an annual basis over the period during which claims may be brought against the Group.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 Section 5: Capital structure and financial policy This section covers financial assets, financial liabilities and equity held by the Group, along with associated income and expenses.
This includes cash, borrowings, put option arrangements and derivatives: working capital information is included in Section 4.
The instruments in place enable the Group to maintain its required capital structure: retaining conservative capital ratios in order to support the business and maximise shareholder value.
Further details of the Groups capital structure and financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are provided on page 43 of the Operating and Financial Review.
Accounting policy On initial recognition, financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value.
Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition of derivatives and financial assets and financial liabilities measured at each reporting date at fair value are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Transaction costs incurred on borrowings and other financial assets and financial liabilities measured at each reporting date at amortised cost are added to the carrying amounts of the assets or deducted from the carrying amount of the liabilities.
Put option arrangements that allow non-controlling interest shareholders to require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are initially recognised at fair value within derivative financial liabilities, with a corresponding charge directly to equity.
Interest rate swaps, forward exchange contracts, put options over non-controlling interests and other derivatives are classified as financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and are measured at each reporting date at fair value.
Changes in the fair values are included in profit or loss within financing income expense unless the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument see Note 5.5.
The Group only enters into derivative contracts with counterparties with which it has a lending relationship.
Liabilities for contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions are measured at the date of acquisition see Note 6.1 and at each subsequent reporting date at fair value see Note 5.6 according to the terms of the purchase agreement.
Changes to the fair value of such consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Contingent consideration is generally based on a multiple of revenue or profit in a specified future year.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables and measured at each reporting date at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The cash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Borrowings and bank overdrafts are measured at each reporting date at amortised cost.
Amortised cost takes into account any differences between the proceeds and the maturity amount, including issue costs and any discounts or premiums due on settlement.
Such differences are recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the expected life of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost calculation is revised when necessary to reflect changes in the expected cash flows and the expected life of the borrowings including the effects of the exercise of any prepayment, call or similar options.
Any resulting adjustment to the carrying amount of the borrowings is recognised as interest expense in the income statement.
Partnership units investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are measured at each reporting date at fair value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment and foreign exchange gains and losses, until the financial asset or liability is derecognised.
Dividends on an available-for-sale equity instrument are recognised in profit or loss when the entity's right to receive payment is established.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Where terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such a modification or exchange is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability, and the difference between the carrying amounts of the original liability and the fair value of the new liability is recognised in the income statement.
