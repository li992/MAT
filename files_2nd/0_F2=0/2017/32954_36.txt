NOTE 30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED D. EQUITY PRICE RISK The Groups balance sheet is exposed to market risk by way of holding some investments in other companies on a short term basis Note 14.
Variations in market value over the life of these investments have or will have an impact on the balance sheet and the income statement.
The Directors believe that the exposure to market price risk is acceptable in the Groups circumstances.
The Groups balance sheet at 31 December 2017 includes available-for-sale investments with a value of 381.3 million 2016: 230.3 million which are subject to fluctuations in the underlying share price.
A change of 1% in price will have an impact of 3.8 million on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the fair value of the available for sale investments will change by the same amount.
E. CAPITAL DISCLOSURES The Group seeks to maintain a capital structure which enables it to continue as a going concern and which supports its business strategy.
The Groups capital is provided by equity and debt funding.
The Group manages its capital structure through cash flow from operations, returns to shareholders primarily in the form of dividends and the raising or repayment of debt.
F. LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the financial charges on its debt instruments.
Financial division liquidity risk Positions can be closed at any time by clients and can also be closed by the Group, in accordance with the Groups margining rules.
If after closing a position a client is in surplus, then the amount owing is repayable on demand by the Group.
When client positions are closed, any corresponding positions relating to the hedged position if applicable are closed with brokers.
Liquidity risk arises if the Group encounters difficulty in meeting obligations which arise following profitable positions being closed by clients.
This risk is managed through the Group holding client funds in separately segregated accounts whereby cash is transferred to or from the segregated accounts on a daily basis to ensure that no material mismatch arises between the aggregate of client deposits and the fair value of open positions, and segregated cash.
Through this risk management process, the Group considers liquidity risk to be low.
2017 2016 000 000 Client deposits 43,741 46,760 Open positions 6,667 16,897 Client funds 37,074 29,863 CFH trades on a matched principal basis and financial instruments are used to hedge all client positions.
The management of market risk in respect of matching of derivatives is through automated tools, together with active monitoring and management by senior personnel under the supervision of its Directors.
CFHs liquidity obligations are monitored daily and it is adequately capitalised with a steady revenue stream to meet its day to day obligations.
CFH client deposits balance as at 31 December 2017 was 71.6 million 2016: 76.2 million.
