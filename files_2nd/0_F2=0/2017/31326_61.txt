Share-based payments During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group had two equity settled share schemes.
Founder Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance Share Plan The total share-based payment charge for the year under these schemes was 18.0 million 2016: 1.4 million with associated social security costs of 2.5 million 2016: 0.1 million.
Founder Long-Term Incentive Plan Founder LTIP The Founders and Joint Chief Executives are entitled to a share award dependent on the growth in EPRA NAV.
The target for the Founder LTIP is that EPRA NAV per ordinary share after adding back dividends and other returns to shareholders must exceed a compound growth rate of 10% per annum in a three-year performance period.
The Founder LTIP plan has repeated to reward performance in each three-year period: the current performance period ending on 31 December 2018.
The value of the share award for each Chief Executive is calculated as 12.5% of the excess growth over the 10% growth target.
Any amount payable under the Founder LTIP is to be satisfied by the award of ordinary shares of the Company.
The total share-based payment charge for the year under this scheme was 16.8 million 2016: nil with associated social security costs of 2.3 million 2016: nil.
Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP awards share options with a nil exercise price to Executive Directors and senior employees.
The number of options granted is calculated with reference to the employees salary and the share price prior to the grant date.
To reflect the fact that 2012 was a transitional year between the 2005 Share Option Scheme and the PSP, two awards were granted to participants, one with a two-year performance period and one with a three-year performance period.
Vesting of the awards is staggered over the three years following the performance period, with one third vesting each year if performance targets are met.
Performance targets are based on Total Shareholder Return and Net Asset Value growth relative to a peer group of listed UK REITs.
