119 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES General information SEGRO plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given ontheinsideback cover.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group and the nature of the Groups operations are set out in the Strategic Report onpages16to20.
These Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and is the functional currency of the Company.
Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Groups Financial Statements also comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
In addition, the Group has also disclosed additional measures relating to the Best Practice Recommendations Guidelines issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate, as discussed further in Note 2.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
This is discussed in the Financial Review on page 35.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the Company.
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties, available-for-sale investments and certain financial assets and liabilities including derivatives.
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and a new Interpretation issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017.
The following standards and amendments have been adopted by the Group and the Company for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2017: Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses amendments to IAS 12 Disclosure initiative amendments to IAS 7 The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the Financial Statements of the Group or the Company for the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect future periods.
The amendments to IAS 7 requires disclosure of changes in financial liabilities and assets arising from financing activities.
See Note 26 iv for the Group and Company analysis.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2017, and have not been applied in preparing these Financial Statements: Amendments to IFRS 2, Share-based payments, on clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 16 Leases Amendment to IAS 40, Investment property relating to transfers of investment property Annual improvements 20142016 IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 120 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED None of these standards not yet effective are expected to have a significant effect on the Financial Statements of the Group or Company.
Certain Standards whichmight have an impact are discussed below.
Title of standard IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Nature of change IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
Impact The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and is expecting the following impact from the adoption of the new standard on1January 2018: i.
Classification Financial assets and liabilities IFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, FVOCI and FVTPL.
The standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.
At 31 December 2017 the Group held no equity investments classified as available for sale and so IFRS 9 will have no impact on this financial asset category.
There will be no impact on the Groups accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities.
The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and have not been changed.
Impairment Financial assets and contract assets The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses ECL rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39.
It applies to financial assets classified at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, contract assets under IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, lease receivables, loan commitments and certain financial guarantee contracts.
The significant financial assets held by the Group that will be impacted by the impairment losses recognised under IFRS 9 are trade receivables.
Gross trade receivables held at 31 December 2017 were 30.4m with an impairment provision recognised under IAS 39 of 3.7m.
Based on the reasons set out in the Credit risk management section in Note 17 the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is deemed to be low.
Management have performed an assessment of the impact of impairment losses recognised for trade receivables under IFRS 9 at 31 December 2017 through estimating the ECLs based on actual credit loss experienced over the past three years.
Basedon this assessment the impact and volatility on impairment losses recognised under IFRS 9 is estimated to be immaterial.
The Company holds intercompany loan and receivables balances with the subsidiaries of the Group as disclosed in Note 7 and 14.
Management do not estimate there to be a material impact on the Company only Financial Statements from the recognition of impairment provisions for the loans and receivables under IFRS 9 compared to the current provision held under IAS 39. iii.
Hedge accounting As a general rule, more hedge relationships might be eligible for hedge accounting, as the standard introduces a more principles-based approach.
The Group has confirmed that the current hedge relationships in place at 31 December 2017 for foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges will qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
The Group does not currently intend to designate other derivatives instruments currently used as part of its risk management strategy as hedging relationships under IFRS 9. iv.
Disclosures The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation.
These are expected to change the nature and extent of the Groups disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
Date of adoption by Group Must be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group will apply the new rules retrospectively from 1January 2018, with the practical expedients permitted under the standard.
Comparatives for 2017 are not expected to be restated.
Title of standard IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Nature of change The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue.
This will replace IAS 18 which covers contracts for goods and services.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer.
The standard permits either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption.
Impact Management has assessed the effects of applying the new standard on the Groups Financial Statements.
Revenue recognition IFRS 15 does not apply to rental income which makes up over 80 per cent of total revenue of the Group, but does apply to other non-core revenue streams: service charge income, management and performance fees and trading property disposals.
At present the Group does not estimate IFRS 15 to have a significant difference in the amount or timing of the recognition of revenue for the non-core income streams that fall under the scope and an immaterial impact on the Group Income Statement.
Disclosures The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements.
These will change the nature and extent of the Groups revenue disclosures.
Date of adoption by Group Mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group intends to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach which means that the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and that comparatives will not be restated.
121 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Title of standard IFRS 16 Leases Nature of change IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016.
It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet for a lessee, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right to use the leased item and a financial liability topay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
The accounting for lessors will not significantly change.
Impact At present, as a lessee the Group holds a limited number of operating leases, with the non-cancellable future lease payments at 31December 2017 of 5.1 see Note 24.
Management have performed an assessment of the impact of bringing operating leases on balance sheet based on leases held at 31 December 2017.
IFRS 16 is estimated to have an immaterial impact to theGroup.
Date of adoption by Group Mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019.
At this stage, the Group does not intend to adopt the standard before itseffective date.
The Group intends to apply the simplified transition approach and will not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group or the Company.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the Company and the Subsidiaries the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary areallocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Joint Ventures A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses areeliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment on the asset transferred.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at their proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39, as appropriate, with thecorresponding gain or loss being recognised in the Income Statement.
122 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currency of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Income Statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans and derivatives that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
Consolidation of foreign entities Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in other comprehensive income and recognised in the Group Income Statement when the operation is sold.
The principal exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in 2017 are: Balance Sheet: 1 1.13 31 December 2016: 1 1.17.
Investment properties These properties include completed properties that are generating rent or are available for rent, and development properties that are under development or available for development.
Investment properties comprise freehold and leasehold properties and are first measured at cost including transaction costs, then revalued to market value at each reporting date by independent professional valuers.
Leasehold properties are shown gross of the leasehold payables which are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the Income Statement.
As the Group uses the fair value model, asper IAS 40 Investment Properties, no depreciation is provided.
An asset will be classified as held for sale within investment properties, in line with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, where there is Board approval at the year-end date and the asset is expected to be disposed ofwithin 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Other interests in property Other interests in property include the cost and related fees in respect of land options, which are initially capitalised and regularly tested for impairment.
The impairment review includes consideration of the resale value of the option and likelihood of achieving planning consent.
Trading properties These are properties being developed for sale or being held for sale after development is complete, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Trading properties are transferred to investment properties when there is a change in use evidenced by the commencement of an operating lease to another party, together with the intention to hold the property to generate rent, or for capital appreciation, or for both.
Property acquisitions and disposals Properties are treated as acquired at the point when the Group assumes the significant risks and rewards of ownership and as disposed when these are transferred to the buyer.
Generally this would occur on completion of contract.
Any gains or loss arising on fide-recognition of the property calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee are classified as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualifies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
Revenue Revenue includes gross rental income, joint venture management fee income, income from service charges and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Joint venture management fee income is recognised as income in the period to which it relates.
Rental income Rental income from properties let as operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term rent averaging.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from services is recognised by reference to the state of completion of the relevant services provided atthe reporting date.
Where the Group acts as an agent, service charge income is netted against the relevant property operatingexpenses.
123 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Sale of trading properties Proceeds from the sale of trading properties are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser.
This generally occurs on completion of the contract.
Intangible assets Intangible assets principally relate to computer software costs and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Software costs include both acquired and internal development costs directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives from the point at which the asset is ready for use: Software 33% per annum Plant and equipment Plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes purchase price and any directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets other than investment properties less their residual values, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Plant and equipment 20% per annum Solar panels 5% per annum The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Financial instruments Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing for the relevant currency.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest caps in managing interest rate risk and currency risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the Income Statement.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged, and may go to Other Comprehensive Income.
Derivatives with a maturity of less than 12 months or that expect to be settled within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date are presented as current assets or liabilities.
Other derivatives are presented as non-current assets or liabilities.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
An impairment provision is created for receivables where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect in full.
Trade and other payables are initially measured atfair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale AFS investments AFS investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to fair value.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are taken to equity, and then recycled through the Income Statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement within other investment income.
124 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Pensions Defined benefit scheme The Schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the Balance Sheet.
Operating and financing costs are charged to the Income Statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and financing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future either through a cash refund or reduction in future payments is available.
Professional actuaries are used in relation to defined benefit schemes and the assumptions made are outlined in Note 18.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is measured attheir fair value at the grant date.
The costs are expensed straight-line over the vesting period in the Income Statement, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that nonmarket-based performance conditions will not be met.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
At each Balance Sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity within the share based payment reserve.
Share capital Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.
Shares held by Estera Trust Jersey Limited and Equiniti Limited to satisfy various Group share schemes are disclosed as own shares held and deducted from contributed equity.
Income tax Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Current tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the Balance Sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
No provision is made for temporary differences i arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than a business combination, that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and ii relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that suitable taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences canbe utilised.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revisions and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
125 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Significant areas of estimation uncertainty Property valuations Valuation of property is a central component of the business.
In estimating the fair value, the Group engage a third party qualified valuer to perform the valuation.
Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of the property portfolio is disclosed in Note 27 property valuation techniques and related quantitative information.
Significant areas of judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Accounting for significant property transactions Property transactions are complex in nature.
Management considers each material transaction separately, with an assessment carried out to determine the most appropriate accounting treatment and judgements applied.
The judgements include whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination and the cut off for property transactions on recognition of property assets and revenue recognition.
In making its judgement over the cut-off for property transactions, management considers whether the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets acquired or disposed of has transferred to or from the Group this consideration includes the revenue recognition criteria set out in IAS 18 Revenue for the sale of trading properties.
In making its judgement on whether the acquisition of property through the purchase of a corporate vehicle represents an asset acquisition or business combination, management consider whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired contain both input and processes along with the ability to create outputs.
The judgements used in accounting for the Airport Property Portfolio as an asset acquisition during 2017 are set out in Note 13 i. REIT Status The Company has elected for UK REIT and French SIIC status.
To continue to benefit from these tax regimes, the Group is required to comply with certain conditions as outlined in Note 10.
Management intends that the Group should continue as a UK REIT and a French SIIC for the foreseeable future.
Other less significant judgements and sources of uncertainty relate to estimating the fair value of financial instruments and the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the Groups retirement benefit obligations.
ADJUSTED PROFIT Adjusted profit is a non-GAAP measure and is the Groups measure of underlying profit, which is used by the Board and senior management to measure and monitor the Groups income performance.
It is based on the Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines of European Public Real Estate Association EPRA, which calculate profit excluding investment and development property revaluations and gains or losses on disposals.
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments and associated close-out costs and their related taxation, as well as other permitted one-off items, are also excluded.
Refer to the Supplementary Notes for all EPRA adjustments.
The Directors may also exclude from the EPRA profit measure additional items gains and losses which are considered by them to be non-recurring, unusual or significant by virtue of size and nature.
No non-EPRA adjustments to underlying profit were made in the current or prior periods.

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND SUBSIDIARIES 7 i Profit from joint ventures after tax The table below presents a summary Income Statement of the Groups largest joint ventures, all of which are accounted for using the equity method as set out in Note 1.
Roxhill operates in the UK and develops big box logistics assets and SELP is incorporated in Luxembourg and owns logistics property assetsin Continental Europe.
The Group holds 50 per cent of the share capital and voting rights in the joint ventures.
On 9 March 2017 SEGRO acquired the remaining 50 per cent interest in the Airport Property Partnership APP joint venture property portfolio it did not already own for 365.0 million funded with a combination of 216 million of cash and the disposal of 149 million of assets to the joint venture partner.
Consequently, the APP share of profit is only included in the table below to 9 March 2017 the date of acquisition and no balance sheet in respect of APP is included at 31 December 2017.
This asset acquisition transaction has primarily resulted in property acquisitions of 1,112.6 million see Note 13 and associated net debt of 379.2 million see Note 26 being recognised.

Other comprehensive income at share of 3.1million is included in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income as transfer to the Income Statement of realised loss on derivatives 2016: 2.1 million loss in respect of fair value of derivatives in effective hedge relationships.
SELP is a SPPICAV in France, and does not pay tax on its French property income or gains on property sales, provided that at least 85 per cent of the French subsidiaries property income is distributed to their immediate shareholder.
In addition, SELP has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring the property rental business of each French subsidiary represents more than 80 per cent of its assets.
Any potential or proposed changes to the SPPICAV legislation are monitored.
131 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 7.
The external borrowings of the joint ventures are non-recourse to the Group.
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of 926.9 million 2016: 1,109.1 million of borrowings was 938.6 million 2016: 1,108.6 million.
This results in a fair value adjustment decrease in net assets of 11.7 million 2016: 0.5 million increase, at share 5.9 million 2016: 0.2 million, see Note 12.
On 20 November 2017 SELP issued an eight year, 500.0 million unsecured bond at an annual coupon of 1.50 per cent as discussed further in the Finance Review on page 34.
In February 2016, SEGRO entered into an agreement with Roxhill Development Group to develop a portfolio of big box logistics assets in the UK through a series of joint ventures which are at various stages of planning and development.
SEGRO provides certain services, including venture advisory and asset management to the SELP joint venture and receives fees for doing so.
Performance fees may also be payable from SELP to SEGRO based on its IRR subject to certain hurdle rates.
The first calculation and potential payment is on the fifth anniversary of the inception of SELP, October 2018, but 50 per cent of this is subject to clawback based on performance over the period to the tenth anniversary, October 2023.
If performance has improved at this point, additional fees might be triggered.
Based on property values at 31 December 2017, the net profit impact on the Group of the first calculation, taking account of the gross fee due, the cost of the fee payable by SELP at share and the clawback terms, is estimated to be around 7 million but subject to change for transactions and market related performance through the remainder of the measurement period.

The net asset value of subsidiaries is considered to be the approximation of its value in use.
This results in the recognition of a reversal or charge for impairment at the end of the reporting period.
Since subsidiary companies primarily hold property, assumptions and inputs used in determining their fair value are shown in Note 27.

This excludes net fair value gains and losses on interest rate swaps and other derivatives of 21.5 million loss 2016:2.6 million loss and the cost of early close out of debt of 145.3 million 2016: 1.0 million.
The early close out of debt arose as part of the debt refinancing exercise which took place during the year and is discussed in more detail in the Finance Review on page 34.
This primarily arises in respect of premium paid, and to a lesser extent reduced fees and the acceleration of unamortised costs, in September 2017 to close out of 550 million sterling bonds, which totalled 133.1 million.
The balance relates to similar costs incurred in repaying the 200 million 2018 bond in May 2017 and the cost to early repay a term loan in July 2017.
The interest capitalisation rates for 2017 ranged from 3.0 per cent to 4.0 per cent 2016: 4.0 per cent to 5.3 per cent.
Interest is capitalised gross of taxrelief.

TAX CONTINUED 10 ii Factors affecting tax charge for the year The tax charge is lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
The differences are: 2017 2016 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 976.3 426.4 Exclude valuation surplus in respect of UK properties not taxable 742.3 244.4 234.0 182.0 Multiplied by standard rate of UK corporation tax of 19.25 per cent 2016: 20.0 per cent 45.0 36.4 Effects of: REIT & SIIC exemption on income and gains 18.7 22.5 Non-deductible items 1.5 0.1 Joint venture tax adjustment 21.6 11.6 Higher tax rates on international earnings 17.3 5.9 Adjustment in respect of prior years 0.3 0.4 Adjustment in respect of assets not recognised 3.8 0.2 Total tax charge on profit on ordinary activities 20.0 7.7 10 iii REIT and SIIC regimes and other tax judgements SEGRO is a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT and does not pay tax on its UK property income or gains on property sales, provided that at least 90 per cent of the Groups UK property income is distributed as a dividend to shareholders, which becomes taxable in their hands.
In addition, the Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring its worldwide property rental business represents more than 75 per cent of total profits and assets.
Any potential or proposed changes to theREIT legislation are monitored and discussed with HMRC.
It is managements intention that the Group will continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future.
SEGRO is also a SIIC in France, and does not pay tax on its French property income or gains on property sales, provided that at least 95 per cent of the French subsidiaries property income is distributed to their immediate shareholder.
In addition, the Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring the property rental business of each French subsidiary represents more than 80 per cent of its assets.
Any potential or proposed changes to the SIIC legislation aremonitored.
It is managements intention that the Group will continue as a SIIC for the foreseeable future.
The joint venture tax adjustment is required because the profit on ordinary activities before tax includes share of profit from joint ventures after tax, whereas the total tax balance excludes joint ventures.
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax laws and prior experience.

TAX CONTINUED The Group has recognised revenue tax losses of 1.2 million 2016: 0.3 million available for offset against future profits.
Further unrecognised tax losses of 813.0 million also exist at 31 December 2017 2016: 799.9 million of which 48.6 million 2016: 46.2 million expires in nine years.
The majority of the unrecognised tax loss balance relates to historic capital losses that arose on property disposals and on losses generated from debt close-out costs.
For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities or deferred tax assets arising from investment properties that are measured using the fair value model, the Directors have reviewed the Groups investment property portfolios and concluded that the Groups investment properties are not held under a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment properties over time, rather than through sale.
Therefore, in determining the Groups deferred taxation on investment properties, the Directors have determined that the presumption that the carrying amounts of investment properties measured using the fair value model are recovered entirely through sale is not rebutted.
As a result, the Group has recognised deferred taxes on changes in fair value of investment properties for all jurisdictions, with the exception of the UK and France, where the Group is not subject to any corporate income taxes onthe fair value changes of the investment properties on disposal.
10 v Factors that may affect future tax charges No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, nonet UK tax is expected to be payable.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax is due to fall in stages to 17 per cent by 2020.
This is unlikely to significantly impact the Groups taxcharge.

The Groups wholly-owned and joint venture property portfolio is valued by CBRE Ltd on a half yearly basis.
The valuations conform to International Valuation Standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of the transaction prices paid for similar properties.
In estimating the fair value of the properties, the valuers consider the highest and best use of the properties.
There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year.
Fees payable to CBRE Ltd for the valuation of the Groups wholly-owned properties are based on a fixed percentage of the property portfolios valuation.
CBRE Ltd also undertakes some professional and agency work on behalf of the Group, although this is limited in relation to the activities of the Group as a whole.
The firm advises us that the total fees paid by the Group represent less than 5 per cent of its total revenue in anyyear.
Completed properties include buildings that are occupied or are available for occupation.
Development properties include land available for development landbank, land under development and construction in progress.
Property acquisitions include 1,112.6 million in respect of the APP property portfolio acquisition, discussed further in Note 7.
The purchase of the APP property portfolio and associated net assets has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, on the basis that the acquisition only resulted in the transfer of ownership of property and related net assets, no employees were being acquired or inherited as part of the transaction and the acquired assets cannot operate independently from the rest of the SEGRO Group.
No trading properties were transferred to investment properties during 2017 2016: nil.
Long-term leasehold values within investment properties amount to 60.8 million 2016: 34.1 million.
All other properties are freehold.

Financial assets also include trade and other receivables excluding prepaid expenses, available-for-sale investments, loans to joint ventures and cash and cash equivalents, which are all classified as other financial assets.
Financial liabilities in the Group comprise forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency swap contracts which are categorised as fair value through the Income Statement non-hedge and forward foreign exchange contracts, cross-currency swap contracts designated and unsecured US Private Placement notes as net investment hedges.
Financial liabilities also include secured and unsecured bank loans, unsecured bond issues and unsecured US Private Placement not designated as net investment hedges notes which are categorised as debt and initially recognised at fair value less costs and subsequently at amortised cost: and trade and other payables excluding deferred revenue which are classified as other financialliabilities.
The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, with the exception of unsecured bond issues and unsecured US Private Placement notes.
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of 1,489.0 million of unsecured bonds issued was 1,680.4 million 2016: 1,491.2 million compared with 1,850.9 million fair value.
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of 573.9 million of unsecured US Private Placement notes was 546.0 million 2016: nil.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates with matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps, currency swap contracts and interest rate caps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and the appropriate exchange rate at the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Unlisted investments, such as those classified as available-for-sale investments, are typically valued by the Fund Manager based on the amount at which the asset would be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The methodology used to estimate fair value will depend on the nature and facts and circumstances of the investment but will use one of the following bases: transaction value, earnings multiple, net assets, price of recent investment and sale price, where appropriate a marketability discount will be applied.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Company to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
145 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale investments, forward exchange and currency swap contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as detailed above.
All of these financial instruments would be classified as level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 13, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset orliability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
There were no transfers betweencategories in the current or prior year.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity financing in keeping with our long-term mid-cycle LTV target of 40 per cent.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of amix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity and Notes 19 to 21.
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues and drawings against medium-term committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in Note16.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups transactional foreign exchange exposures mainly arise as a result of treasury financing and hedging activities.
These activities are carried out in SEGRO plc on behalf of the Group and the resulting exposures to euro or US dollar are not routinely hedged.
The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures resulting from cross border flows.
The business does however have operations in Continental Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros, hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into sterling for each financial period and at each Balance Sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing Balance Sheet translation exposure is described in the Foreign Currency Translation Risk section in the Financial Review onpage 35.
The Groups and Companys Balance Sheet translation exposure including the impact of derivative financial instruments is summarised below: 2017 2016 Euros US Dollars Total Euros US Dollars Total m m m m m m Group Gross currency assets 2,242.6 35.7 2,278.3 1,739.6 39.7 1,779.3 Gross currency liabilities 1,547.2 21.2 1,568.4 1,198.2 23.3 1,221.5 Net exposure 695.4 14.5 709.9 541.4 16.4 557.8 Company Gross currency assets 1,182.5 25.9 1,208.4 928.2 38.6 966.8 Gross currency liabilities 1,683.4 47.1 1,730.5 1,184.1 61.9 1,246.0 Net exposure 500.9 21.2 522.1 255.9 23.3 279.2 2017 Group gross currency liabilities include 567.2 million 502.0 million and USD 28.6 million 21.2 million designated as net investment hedges.
2016 Group gross currency liabilities include 299.4 million 255.9 million and USD28.6 million 23.3 million designated as net investment hedges.
The remaining gross currency liabilities of the Group shown in the table above that are not designated as net investment hedges are either held directly in a euro or US dollar functional currency entity or passed down to such an entity from a sterling functional currency company through inter-company funding arrangements.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 64.5 million 2016: 50.7 million, with a sensitivity of 63.2 million against the euro 2016: 49.2 million and 1.3 million against the US dollar 2016: 1.5million.
The 10 per cent sensitivity rate is used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to management and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of net assets after taking account of external loans, currency swap contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts at the period end for a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies.
For the Company, the sensitivity of the net assets is 47.4 million 2016: 25.4 million with a sensitivity of 45.5 million against the euro 2016: 23.2 million and 1.9 million against the US dollar 2016: 2.1 million.
146 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts Some of the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts held by the Group are designated as net investment hedges of euro and US dollar denominated subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the Income Statement when the operation is sold.
The remaining foreign exchange and currency swap contracts are effectively economic cash flow hedges, for example using surplus cash in one currency to provide typically through intercompany debt funding arrangements with overseas subsidiaries funds to repay debt, or to fund development expenditure or acquisitions in another currency.
These instruments have not been designated as hedges.
As a consequence exchange movements in respect of these instruments are taken through the Income Statement.
Offsetting these movements are 30 million exchange gains 2016: 100.6 million gain arising on intercompany debt funding arrangements discussed above resulting in a gain on exchange differences of 0.1 million 2016: 0.3 million loss within net finance costs in Note 9.
The Groups translation exposure risk management policy is that between 30 and 100 per cent of assets denominated in a foreign currency should be hedged by liabilities in the same currency.
During the year the foreign currency denominated liabilities of the Group were predominantly the currency leg of foreign exchange and currency swap contracts both those designated as net investment hedges and those which are effectively cash flow hedges and the application of this policy is the main economic purpose of these instruments.
Further details are provided within the Foreign Currency Translation Risk section of the Financial Review on page 35.

The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that 50 to 100 per cent of net borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require the approval of the Finance Committee and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the Balance Sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease increase by 5.8 million 2016: decrease increase by 2.7 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the Balance Sheet to reflect interest rate movements.
147 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances atthe end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts, based on their contractual maturities, outstanding as at the reporting date: Average contract Notional principal Fair fixedinterest rate amount value 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 % % m m m m Pay fixed, receive floating contracts: Group In one year or less In more than one year but less than two In more than two years but less than five 0.24 606.9 10.0 In more than five years 0.34 222.2 4.7 Total 829.1 14.7 Company In one year or less In more than one year but less than two In more than two years but less than five 0.24 606.9 10.0 In more than five years 0.34 222.2 4.7 Total 829.1 14.7 Receive fixed, pay floating contracts: Group In one year or less 5.63 250.0 11.1 In more than one year but less than two 6.41 3.42 181.0 350.0 16.6 14.9 In more than two years but less than five 3.52 6.44 828.0 509.0 41.6 65.2 In more than five years Total 1,009.0 1,109.0 58.2 91.2 Company In one year or less 5.63 250.0 11.1 In more than one year but less than two 6.41 3.42 181.0 350.0 16.6 14.9 In more than two years but less than five 3.52 6.44 828.0 509.0 41.6 65.2 In more than five years Total 1,009.0 1,109.0 58.2 91.2 The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them, hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the Income Statement.
The interest rate swaps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR or sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle or receive the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Interest rate cap contracts Under interest rate caps, the Group agrees to receive floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts, should prevailing market rates rise above a specified strike rate.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups floating rate borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate caps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate cap contracts, based on their contractual maturities, outstanding as at the reporting date: Average contract Notional principal Fair capped interest rate amount value 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 % % m m m m Group In one year or less In more than one year but less than two In more than two years but less than five 1.40 371.2 2.5 In more than five years Total 371.2 2.5 Company In one year or less In more than one year but less than two In more than two years but less than five 1.40 371.2 2.5 In more than five years Total 371.2 2.5 The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them, hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the Income Statement.
The interest rate caps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis based on the EURIBOR or sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will receive the difference between the floating rate and the specified strike rate.
149 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 5 per cent of rental income.
Trade receivables were less than 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2017 and at 31 December 2016.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
Inexcess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
Ageing of past due trade but not impaired receivables were as follows: 2017 2016 m m 030 days 2.1 1.5 3060 days 1.0 0.9 6090 days 0.1 1.1 90180 days 1.0 0.4 180 days 0.7 0.6 Past due 4.9 4.5 Not due 21.8 18.3 Total trade receivables 26.7 22.8 No other receivables were considered impaired or overdue.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to banks and short-term liquidity funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by requiring that adequate cash and committed bank facilities are available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash flows over a rolling 18-month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in more detail in the Financial Position and Funding section in the Financial Review on pages 33 to 34.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups and Companys remaining contractual maturity profile for its financial instruments.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group and the Company can be required to pay.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Background The Group has one defined benefit pension scheme, the SEGRO Pension Scheme the Scheme, following the buy-out of the Bilton Group Pension Scheme which was finalised during 2017 with members benefits now secured with an insurance company.
The terms and conditions of the Bilton Scheme buy-out were agreed on 30 April 2015, subject to true-up, following a data cleanse exercise followed by the issuance of individual policies completed in 2017.
The impact of derecognising the Bilton Group Pension Scheme was net asset neutral and no gain or loss was recognised in 2017.
Defined benefit pension provision is through the SEGRO trust-based scheme.
This arrangement is now closed to new entrants and to future accrual of benefits effective from the end of 2016 giving rise to a past service credit of 2.3 million recognised in 2016.
In this arrangement, the assets of the Scheme are invested separately from those of the Group and the Scheme is run by an independent Trustee Board.
The Trustee Board of the pension scheme is required by law to act in the best interests of the fund and its members and also takes into consideration the interests of the employers.
There is a requirement for the Trustee Board to have member representation, with the other Trustees being company appointed.
The Trustee Board is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the relevant fund, although the Company must be consulted on this and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Cash contributions payable to the Scheme are reviewed at least every three years as part of an actuarial valuation.
Following each actuarial valuation the Company agrees a deficit recovery plan with the Trustee Board if necessary.
SEGRO and the Trustee Board are required to agree prudent assumptions for the actuarial valuation, which differs to the corporate bond yield based discount rate and best estimate assumptions required to measure the schemes obligations under IAS 19 for the purpose of our Company accounts.
This is the main reason why the IAS 19 position disclosed in these accounts shows a surplus, whereas the Schemes most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2016 revealed a deficit of 17.7 million.
To meet this deficit SEGRO agreed to pay annual contributions of 7.24 million, payable in monthly instalments over the period up to February 2018 which, together with a prudent allowance for investment returns, is expected to remove the deficit.
As a result, the Company paid contributions of 7.9 million in 2017 2016: 7.7 million, which included contributions towards the build-up of member benefits before the scheme closed to future benefit accrual at 31 December 2016.
In addition, SEGRO meets the costs of running the Scheme including all statutory levies.
In 2017 total costs of 0.5 million were recognised within administration expenses 2016: 0.9 million.
The Schemes funding position and cash contributions will be reviewed as part of the next actuarial valuation due to take place as at 31 March 2019.
For some pension schemes, IFRIC 14 potentially: limits the surplus in a pension scheme that can be recognised on the balance sheet: and or requires additional pension liabilities to be recognised where scheduled future deficit contributions are greater than the unadjusted accounting deficit.
SEGRO considers that were a pension asset to be realised in respect of this scheme after all member benefits have been paid and after the scheme is wound up, this would be fully recoverable by SEGRO in line with the rules of the scheme.
In the meantime, in the ordinary course of business the Trustee Board has no rights to unilaterally wind up the Scheme or otherwise augment the benefits payable to members.
Therefore, any pension surplus is recognised in full under current accounting standards.
In 2015, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB published an Exposure Draft setting out proposed changes to IFRIC 14.
Management understands that there have been subsequent discussions and further developments are expected in 2018.
SEGRO will reconsider the impact of IFRIC 14 once there is greater certainty around the proposed changes to IFRIC 14.
The IAS 19 valuation of the Scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2016 and updated by the independent actuary to 31 December 2017.
Approximately 80 per cent of the Schemes assets are held in a Liability Driven Investment LDI matching portfolio of gilts, leveraged gilt funds, swaps and corporate bonds, which provide a broad hedge for the Schemes liabilities to changes to both future interest rate and inflation expectations.
It is the intention to further reduce investment risk by moving the remaining 20 per cent of assets invested in equities and other return seeking assets into lower risk investments over the period to 2030, accelerating this to take advantage of any opportunities to lock in funding level improvements in the meantime.
The Schemes insured pensions are valued by an actuary and the asset value is equal to the corresponding benefit obligation for the vast majority of these policies.
All other fair asset values, including those for the Schemes LDI investments, are provided by the relevant fund managers.
As the Scheme mostly invests in pooled funds, the fair asset values reflect the fund managers valuations, rather than quoted prices in active markets.
However, the fund values are all based on the prices of the underlying investments within each fund.
The Schemes assets do not include any financial instruments or property owned by the Group.
There is a risk to the Company that other adverse experience e. g. if members live longer than assumed could lead to a requirement for SEGRO to make additional contributions to recover any deficit that arises.
Other than market and demographic risks, which are common to most retirement benefit schemes, there are no specific risks in the Scheme which the Group considers to be significant or unusual.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES CONTINUED Both life expectancy estimates use the standard S2PA 2016: S2PA base tables with a scaling factor of 80 per cent for males and 90 per cent for females 2016: 80per cent and 90 per cent respectively.
Future improvements to the life expectancy are in line with CMI 2014 projections with an assumed long-term rate of improvement of one and a half per cent p. a.
2016: one and a quarter per cent p. a.. 2017 2016 Credits Charges on the basis of the assumptions were: m m Credit Charge to Group Income Statement Operating profit: Current service cost 0.4 Past service costs 2.3 Net finance costs: Net interest income 1.3 0.9 Net credit to the Group Income Statement 1.3 2.8 Charge credit to Group Statement of Comprehensive Income 16.2 15.0 All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately and relate to continuing operations.
The cumulative recognised actuarial losses are 30.3 million 2016: 14.1 million.
Fair value of the assets and liabilities of the schemes The amount included in the Balance Sheet arising from the Groups assets in respect of its defined benefit retirement schemes is as follows: 2017 2016 m m Movement in assets 1 January 309.2 255.0 Interest on scheme assets 7.4 9.4 Actuarial gains 28.2 54.5 Employer cash contributions 7.9 7.7 Member cash contributions 0.1 Benefits paid 20.9 17.5 Settlement of Bilton scheme 26.0 31 December 305.8 309.2 Movement in liabilities 1 January 263.5 234.8 Service cost 0.4 Interest cost 6.1 8.5 Past service cost 2.3 Actuarial gains losses changes in demographic assumptions 6.0 4.7 changes in financial assumptions 17.5 51.6 changes due to liability experience 20.9 7.4 Benefits paid 20.9 17.5 Settlement of Bilton scheme 26.0 Other 0.1 31 December 267.1 263.5 Analysis of net assets: Market value of schemes assets 305.8 309.2 Present value of funded schemes liabilities 267.1 263.5 Retirement benefit asset recognised in Pension assets in the Balance Sheet 38.7 45.7 The actual return on the Scheme assets in the period was a gain of 35.6 million 2016: 63.9 million.
Both assets and liabilities include an extra 20.0 million ofinsured pensions in the Trustees name at 31 December 2017, which had not previously been recognised.
This does not change the net balance sheet position nor the amounts recognised in Group Income Statement and Other Comprehensive Income.
The average duration of the benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period is 21 years 2016: 20 years for the Scheme.
As the Scheme has closed to future benefit accrual, there are no active members within the Scheme.
The liabilities are split 42 per cent 2016: 39 per cent to deferred and 58 per cent 2016: 54 per cent to retired members.
In 2016 7 per cent related to active members.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES CONTINUED The expected employers contributions to be paid in the year ending 31 December 2018 are 1.2 million 2017: 7.2 million.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes for which 1.6 million has been recognised as an expense 2016: 1.6 million.
Sensitivities The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme net assets are set out below.
These were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the Schemes assets.
The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on SEGRO scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% Decrease increase by 23.9m 27.6m Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increase decrease by 11.3m 11.1m Rate of inflation CPI and RPI Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 11.1m 10.0m No separate sensitivity has been provided for the pensions in payment assumptions as these are not distinct assumptions in their own right, but dependent on market changes to inflation.
This sensitivity is included within the overall inflation assumption sensitivity shown, which allows for the corresponding change in pension increases that would be caused by a change in inflation.

The combined impact was that the Company raised a total of 572.8 million, before 16.3 million expenses, and as a result on 28 March 2017 the Companys share capital increased by 16.6 million and share premium by 539.9 million.
Share-based payments The Group operates the share-based payments schemes set out below.
To reflect the dilutive effects of the 2017 Rights Issue, shares under option on 28 March 2017 and the exercise price for Sharesave were adjusted for by a factor of 1.046.
19 i Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP The DSBP is for Executive Directors and the Leadership team.
A percentage of any payment made under the Bonus Scheme is deferred to shares and held in trust for three years.
The percentage subject to deferral for Executive Directors is 50 per cent of the Bonus payment.
This scheme is detailed in the Remuneration Report on page 96.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse unless the participant is deemed to be a Good Leaver, in which case the award will be released on the vesting date.

SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 19 ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary employee share scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers.
Vesting of awards is subject to three or four-year performance conditions and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions of the LTIP are detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 94 to 95.
Ifa participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse, unless the participant is deemed to be a Good Leaver, in which case the award will be reduced pro-rata on length of employment in relation to the award date.
From 2017 onwards, a mandatory two-year holding period after vesting was introduced for the Executive Directors.
The calculation of the award was based on a share price of 493.0 pence, the closing mid-market share price on 28 April 2017.
No consideration was paid for the grant of any award.
The Black-Scholes model has been used to fair value the shares granted currently under award, apart from the TSR elements of the award which uses the Monte Carlo model.

UK employees, who have been employed by the Group since 1 October of the preceding year, may be awarded shares in relation to the Companys prior year PBT performance.
In 2017, as the PBT performance target was achieved in full participating employees were each awarded shares to the value of 3,000.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group within three years from the date of award the shares will be forfeited, unless the employee is deemed to be a Good Leaver, in which case the shares will be transferred out of the trust to the participant.
233,945 of these shares have been held by the SIP Trust on behalf of employees for over three years.

It is not HMRC approved but the eligibility and performance conditions of the award are designed to replicate the SIP.
Employees are granted awards which are released by the Trustees at the conclusion of a three-year holding period.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group during the three-year period then the award will lapse unless the participant is deemed to be a Good Leaver.

PROPERTY VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND RELATED QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION All of the Groups properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13, in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 December 2017 and there were no transfers between levels during the year.
Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties are those which are unobservable, as opposed to level 1 inputs from quoted prices and level 2 observable inputs either directly, i. e. as prices, or indirectly, i. e. derived from prices.
Based on different approaches for different properties, the following valuation techniques can be used for the same class of assets: The yield methodology valuation technique is used when valuing the Groups assets which uses market rental values capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the fair market values per square metre derived from actual market transactions for similar assets.
For properties under construction and the majority of land held for development, properties are valued using a residual method valuation.
Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the investment value using the above mentioned methodology for completed buildings.
Deductions are then made for the total estimated costs to complete, including notional finance costs and developers profit, to take into account the hypothetical purchasers management of the remaining development process and their perception ofrisk with regard to construction and the property market e. g. asregards potential cost overruns and letting risk.
Land values are cross-checked against the rate per hectare derived from actual market transactions.
Other land is also valued on this comparative basis, the ranges for which are per hectare 0.1 million 3.6 million 2016: 1.8 million 9.1 million for the UK and 0.1 million 2.6 million 2016: 0.2 million 2.5 million for Continental Europe.
An increase decrease to ERV will increase decrease valuations, while an increase decrease to yield will decrease increase valuations.
A sensitivity analysis showing the impact on valuations of changes in yields and ERV on the property portfolio including joint ventures at share is shown below.
Sensitivity analysis Impact on valuation of 25bp Impact on valuation of 5% change change in nominal equivalent yield in estimated rental value ERV Group total completed property portfolio Increase Decrease Increase Decrease m m m m m 2017 7,160.4 346.1 383.3 272.1 266.0 2016 5,666.2 243.7 266.2 228.3 221.6 There are interrelationships between all these inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase in more than one input would be to magnify the impact on the valuation.
The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two inputs in opposite directions, e. g. an increase in rent may be offset by an increase in yield.
The below table includes the Groups wholly-owned and joint venture assets at share in order to include the entire portfolio.
The equivalent analysis for the range of inputs on a wholly-owned basis would not be significantly different.
Combined property portfolio column will not cast down but row does cast across.
3 In relation to the completed properties only.
4 Higher value uses includes offices and retail uses, such as trade counters, car showrooms and self-storage facilities.
5 Included in the completed portfolio, the wholly owned assets are: Big box 1,791.8 million 1,216.3 million : light industrial 3,514.7 million 2016: 2,381.6 million : data centres 371.8 million 2016: 314.2 million : and higher value uses 292.3 million 2016: 219.7 million including offices.
