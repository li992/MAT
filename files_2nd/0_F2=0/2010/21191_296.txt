Financial statements MCEV 335 Performance review Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information E9 Present value of life new business premiums The tables below set out the present value of new business premiums PVNBP written by the life and related businesses, the value of new business and the resulting margin, firstly gross and then net of tax and non-controlling interests.
The PVNBP calculation is equal to total single premium sales received in the period plus the discounted value of regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts, and is expressed at the point of sale.
The premium volumes and projection assumptions used to calculate the present value of regular premiums for each product are the same as those used to calculate the value of new business, so the components of the new business margin are on a consistent basis.
The Weighted Average Capitalisation Factor WACF is the multiple of the annualised regular premium which gives the present value at point of sale of the regular premiums.
This business had a high WACF, reflecting the long duration of the business combined with premiums increasing each year.
