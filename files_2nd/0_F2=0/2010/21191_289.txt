Value of new business grew 43% to 354 million 2009: 247 million, due to our focus on value maximisation through active management of our new business mix, robust cost control and pricing discipline.
Total expected return increased to 773 million 2009: 653 million, reflecting the additional expected return following the reattribution of the inherited estate partly offset by the adoption of implied discount rates as the basis for determining the expected return.
Experience variances of 20 million adverse 2009: 29 million adverse reflect favourable mortality experience offsetting adverse persistency experience in current economic conditions.
Assumption changes were 18 million adverse 2009: 67 million adverse reflecting a net increase in expense allowances, following the closure of our offshore subsidiary to new business.
Europe In Europe, operating profit decreased to 2,096 million 2009: 2,344 million.
Growth in Aviva Europe operating return reflects assumption changes and more favourable operating experience partly offset by lower expected returns.
The reduction in Delta Lloyd operating profit mainly reflects adverse assumption changes.
2009 benefited from favourable assumption changes.
326 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 E2 Geographical analysis of MCEV operating earnings continued Aviva Europe MCEV operating earnings increased 18% to 2,013 million 2009: 1,704 million, as positive operating assumption changes, favourable experience variances and modelling improvements more than offset lower expected returns.
Value of new business was 3% lower at 504 million 2009: 521 million.
After allowing for movements in currency, this is in line with prior year.
This reflects increased contributions from profit-sharing products in France and Italy.
These contributions have been offset by the impact of reduced sales in Ireland, Spain and Poland.
Total expected return was 19% lower at 753 million 2009: 934 million reflecting lower assumed rates of return and the adoption of implied discount rates as the basis for determining the expected return.
Experience variances were favourable at 147 million 2009: 43 million.
The 2010 result reflects positive experience on mortality, as well as the release of short-term lapse provisions and the benefit from policyholders switching to unit linked funds in France.
This has been offset by the impact of adverse lapse experience in Spain and Ireland.
Assumption changes on existing business were favourable at 338 million 2009: 8 million adverse.
This arises from the positive impact of a detailed review of our expense assumptions, as well as the positive impact of mortality changes in France.
This is offset by further strengthening of lapse assumptions in Spain and Ireland.
Other operating variances were positive at 271 million 2009: 214 million.
These largely arose in France and relate to modelling refinements of 164 million as well as 107 million from actions taken to reduce the level of policyholder guarantees on profit-sharing products in France.
Delta Lloyd MCEV operating earnings decreased to 83 million 2009: 640 million mainly due to adverse operating assumption changes compared to positive assumption changes in 2009.
Value of new business was negative at 92 million 2009: 48 million reflecting the continuing impacts of adverse economic assumptions.
Total expected return was lower at 354 million 2009: 455 million due to the adoption of implied discount rates as the basis for determining the expected return.
Operating experience and assumption changes on existing business amounted to 336 million adverse 2009: 168 million favourable as the impact of adopting an industry-standard longevity table was partly offset by favourable expense assumption changes related to planned expense savings following restructuring activities.
Other operating variances of 157 million 2009: 65 million related to various modelling changes, mainly in Delta Lloyd Belgium and Delta Lloyd Life.
North America MCEV operating earnings increased to 289 million 2009: 266 million as higher earnings from existing business were partly offset by lower value of new business.
The improvement in in-force earnings was driven by management actions coupled with disciplined spread management, higher expected returns and modelling refinements.
Value of new business of negative 194 million 2009: 16 million positive reflected adverse economic movements, particularly in the second half of the year as risk free rates decreased.
The impact of economic movements has more than offset the benefits of pricing and product management actions.
Total expected return increased to 503 million 2009: 393 million reflecting the adoption of implied discount rates as the basis for determining expected return and the grossing up for tax in 2010 as a result of the reassessment of the tax paying position.
Operating experience and assumption changes on existing business were 153 million adverse 2009: 125 million adverse.
Included within this are positive benefits of disciplined spread management offset by adverse operating assumption changes relating to immediate annuitant mortality strengthening and increased expense loadings.
Other operating variances were 133 million favourable 2009: 18 million adverse reflecting management actions and modelling refinements.

Value of new business was 79% higher at 52 million 2009: 29 million, 11 million excluding the contribution from Australia, reflecting improved scale efficiencies, product mix and volumes.
Total expected return was 57 million 2009: 59 million, 37 million excluding the contribution from Australia, benefiting from the adoption of implied discount rates as the basis for determining the expected return.
Operating experience variances, other operating variances and assumption changes on existing business were nil 2009: 13 million, as favourable mortality and assumptions changes were offset by experience variances.
2 Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumption set across a number of our businesses, most notably in France and the UK Annuity business.
3 Persistency experience remains volatile across most of our businesses, in part reflecting the wider economic circumstances.
In France, persistency experience reflects a release of the short-term provision.
4 Other experience includes, in France, the benefit from policyholders switching to unit-linked funds, and, in the USA favourable spread experience.
5 Favourable maintenance expense assumptions reflect the benefit of the shared service centre in Spain, together with the release of margins in Spain, related to bancassurance joint venture governance costs, and Poland.
In the UK, the expense assumptions include a reallocation of provisions in the service company, better reflecting the expected future allocation of costs.
In the USA, the adverse impact reflects a revised allocation of costs between ongoing and one-off.
In Delta Lloyd, favourable expense assumptions relate to planned expense saving following restructuring activities.
6 Delta Lloyd have updated mortality assumptions to reflect recently published tables, which include a significantly increased allowance for mortality improvements.
In France and the USA, mortality assumptions have been updated reflecting experience.
7 Persistency assumptions have been updated in a number of businesses.
8 Other operating variances for France relate to modelling changes, particularly relating to the time value of options and guarantees, and the benefit of reducing minimum guarantee rates.
In Delta Lloyd, modelling changes include impacts related to commercial mortgages partly offset by changes to group pensions business.
In the US, other operating variances related to the benefit of an AXXX capital solution together with modelling refinements on our asset portfolio.
Project and other related expenses in the UK reflect project costs associated with strategic initiatives, including developments designed to offer a wider range of products to customers, and the simplification of systems and processes.
Project and other related expenses in Delta Lloyd relate to integration costs in Belgium.
2 Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumptions set across a number of our businesses.
3 Persistency experience has been volatile across most of our businesses, in part reflecting wider economic volatility.
In France, positive persistency experience including the release of a short-term provision, in line with positive underlying experience.
In Poland, lapse experience continued to be better than the long-term assumptions for both Life and Pension products.
4 Other experience is favourable overall.
Both France and Italy include one-off adjustments reflecting final commission payments from prior years.
The favourable impact in Italy reflects to one-off profit sharing on a reinsurance treaty.
The favourable impact in Delta Lloyd relates to the revised investment and bonus strategy in Germany following the decision to close this operation to new business.
The adverse impact in the USA relates to the cost of enhancing policyholder crediting rates.
5 Favourable expense assumption changes reflect the impact of cost reductions in Delta Lloyd and Poland, together with the impact of revisions to expense allocations in Delta Lloyd.
The adverse impact in Spain relates to the capitalisation of certain governance costs in respect of bancassurance joint ventures.
6 Favourable mortality assumption changes in France and Poland reflecting recent experience.
The adverse impact in Delta Lloyd reflects the net impact of using updated mortality tables in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, following the issuance of revised advice from the respective actuarial associations.
7 Persistency assumptions have been strengthened across most of our businesses, in light of experience.
In Poland, persistency assumptions have been weakened following sustained favourable experience.
8 Other assumption changes in the US primarily relate to the timing of management action in setting policyholder credited rates.
In Delta Lloyd, the change represents tax effects resulting from a reallocation of assets.
9 Other operating variances in France, Poland and Asia have arisen as a result of more accurate modelling.
In Delta Lloyd, these relate to revisions to investment and bonus strategies and expenses in Delta Lloyd Germany following the decision to close this operation to new business.
In Spain, these reflect the impact of re-pricing actions on risk products.
