Ecofin Water & Power Opportunities pic 34 Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the financial statements Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group and Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 'IFRS' as adopted by the European Union, and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
These comprise standards and interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee as approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee flASC that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRS have been adopted by the European Union.
Previously, the financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 'UK GAAP'.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice 'SORP' for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009.
The financial information for the year ended 31 March, 2009 included in this report has been taken from the Company's full accounts, as restated to comply with IFRS.
Restatement of opening balances relating to equity values, assets and liabilities and profits and losses of the Group and Company between UK GAAP as previously reported and under IFRS as restated have not been presented as there have been no required changes to these reported amounts.
Therefore, restatement tables have not been prepared for any of the primary statements.
The functional currency of the Group is UK pounds sterling as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Accordingly, the financial statements are presented in UK pounds sterling rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.
a Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the SORP is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis consistent with the recommendations of the SORP.
b Adoption of new and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but were not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the European Union : International Accounting Standards flAS IFRSs Effective date IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Reporting Standards 1 July 2009 IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 -Additional Exemptions for First-time Adopters 1 January 2010 IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 - Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 disclosures 1 July 2010 IFRS 2 Amendments to IFRS 2 - Group Cash settled Share-based Payment Transactions 1 January 2010 IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised January 2008 1 July 2009 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification & Measurement 1 January 2013 IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures revised 1 January 2011 c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, EW&PO Finance pic, made up to 31 March each year.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no Company statement of comprehensive income has been prepared.
d Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported in the balance sheet and statement of comprehensive income and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and, to some extent, future events and actions, the Company's actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.
e Presentation of statement of comprehensive income In order to better reflect the activities of the Company as an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In accordance with the Company's status as a UK investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Company's compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 formerly Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. f Income Dividend income from investments is taken into account by reference to the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interest from short-term deposits is accounted for on an accruals basis, as are interest payable and other expenses.
The fixed return on a debt security is recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate on the debt security.
Overseas dividends and other income that are subject to withholding tax are grossed up.
Ecofin Water & Power Opportunities pic 35 Report and Accounts 2010 g Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged wholly to the revenue column of the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income except for: expenses that are incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, which are charged to capital within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income: the investment management fee, which has been allocated 75% to capital and 25% to revenue within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income: performance-related fees which are charged entirely to capital within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income: and expenses that are considered to be capital in nature which are charged to capital within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
h Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were in effect as at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is offset entirely by expenses in the revenue column of the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 formerly Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
i Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the transaction is recognised on the trade date.
The Company's investments have been designated as fair value through profit or loss, and are recognised on the trade date and are initially measured at fair value.
Investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, and changes in fair value are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a capital item.
For listed investments, fair value is deemed to be bid the market price.
For unlisted investments, fair value is measured by the Directors using valuation methodologies in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
Investment in the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary is held at fair value through profit or loss.
Interests in joint ventures are designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition in accordance with IAS 31. j Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and short-term deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
k Dividends Interim and final dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
1 Foreign currency translation Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary items that are carried at fair value and are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Ecofin Water & Power Opportunities pic 36 Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued m Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All finance costs of debt in so far as they relate to the financing of the Company's investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Company's investments can be charged to capital within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In this respect, unless specifically mentioned, the finance costs in relation to the Company have been allocated 75% to capital and 25% to revenue within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
n 6% Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Loan Stock 2016 Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock issued by the Company is regarded as a compound instrument, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component was estimated by assuming that an equivalent but non-convertible obligation of the Company would have a coupon rate of 7%.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company, is included in equity.
The liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate.
Expenses associated with the issue are amortised over the life of the Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated according to the effective interest rate method by applying the assumed interest rate of 7% at initial recognition to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock.
When Loan Stock is repurchased for cancellation, the gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration and the carrying value of the debt and equity elements.
At the time of each re-purchase, the fair value of the consideration is assigned between debt and equity by reference to an equivalent but non-convertible obligation with a coupon of 7%.
Gains losses assigned to the early redemption of debt are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Gains losses assigned to the conversion option are recognised directly in equity.
All gains losses on repurchase are recognised in capital.
In the event of the winding-up or dissolution of the Company, the rights claims of Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock holders would be subordinate to the claims of creditors in respect of secured and unsecured borrowings, including without limitation under the Agreement between the Company and its Prime Broker, and claims under the Loan Note and the Contribution Agreement between the Company and its subsidiary.
o Capital growth entitlement of the Zero Dividend Preference shareholders The Zero Dividend Preference Shares ZDP Shares are designed to provide a pre-determined capital growth from their issue price of 100p on 29 July, 2009 to a final capital entitlement of 160.70p on 31 July, 2016, by which time the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, which issued the ZDP Shares, is due to be wound up.
The initial capital entitlement of 100p will increase by 0.018538% per day, compounded daily.
This is equivalent to a redemption yield of 7% per annum based on the issue price.
No dividends are payable on the ZDP Shares.
The calculated value of the ZDP Shares includes the expenses associated with the issue, which are amortised over the life of the shares, and, therefore, will differ from the capital entitlement of the shares except at maturity on 31 July, 2016.
The provision for the capital growth entitlement of the Zero Dividend Preference Shares is included as a finance cost and charged 100% to capital within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
p Derivatives Investment derivatives are held at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in the capital column of the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
q Option income Option income received from the sale of call or put options is taken to revenue within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a time apportioned basis to the extent that the option is not exercised.
If the option is exercised then any loss in excess of the premium received is taken to capital within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
r Underwriting income Underwriting commission received is generally recognised as income within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income when the issue underwritten closes.
Where all of the shares underwritten are required to be taken up, the commission is recognised as capital within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Where only a proportion of the shares underwritten are required to be taken up, the same proportion of the commission received is recognised as capital with the balance recognised as income.
s Movements in fair value Changes in fair value are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a capital item.
On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as capital items.
t Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business being the investment business.
Consequently, no business segmental analysis is provided.

The Company's financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Company's investment objective and policies Fixed interest securities, cash and liquid resources as well as short-term receivables and payables that arise from its operations Borrowings in various currencies to finance operations Contracts for difference Forward currency contracts Put and call options: and The Company's Ordinary Shares, Zero Dividend Preference Shares, 6% Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2016 and Subscription Shares The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage the risks arising from its investment activities.
As at the year-end there were ten derivative contracts outstanding including six forward currency contracts maturing 19 April, 2010.
The Board sets out its investment policies and its policy on gearing and diversification within the Report of the Directors on page 17 to 23.
The Board and the Company's Investment Manager consider and review the principal risks inherent in managing the Company's assets which are detailed below.
Foreign currency risk The value of the Company's assets and the total return earned by the Company's Shareholders can be significantly affected by foreign exchange movements as most of the Company's assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling, the currency in which the Company's accounts are prepared.
The risk is partially offset by the Company's foreign currency borrowings.

A 10% rise or decline of sterling against foreign currency denominated i. e. non sterling assets held at the year end would have increased decreased the total return and net asset value by 31,131,000 or 8.04% 2009, 10% rise or decline: 17,511,000 or 4.34%.
Interest rate risk The Company is only exposed to significant interest rate risk through its Prime Brokerage borrowings with Citigroup Global Markets Limited and through the fair value of investments in fixed-interest rate securities.
The 6% Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2016 was issued by the Company at a fixed cost until its conversion.
It is carried in the Company's balance sheet at amortised cost rather than at fair value.
The Zero Dividend Preference Shares issued by the Company had a gross redemption yield of 7% at their issue price.
The shares were placed with investors at a price of 100.00p per share on 29 July, 2009 and will be redeemed by the Company on 31 July, 2016 for 160.70p per share.
The fair value of the Company's 6% Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2016 at the year end was 91,798,000 and it had a modified duration interest rate sensitivity of approximately 5.2 years.
A 1 % increase decrease in LIBOR would decrease increase the fair value of the 6% Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2016 by approximately 4,733,000, all other factors being equal.
Borrowing varied throughout the year as part of a Board endorsed policy.
Borrowings at the year-end amounted to the equivalent of 35,535,000 in a variety of currencies, but principally in US Dollars, New Zealand Dollars, Canadian Dollars and sterling.
In addition, the Company had obligations, up until maturity on 30 March, 2009, under three interest rate swap agreements to make payments to Citigroup of 5.415% on a notional amount of 35,000,000, of 4.925% on a notional amount of 28,665,000 and of 5.225% on a notional amount of US$24,963,000.
As a consequence of these arrangements, a portion of the Company's borrowings were, effectively, at fixed rates of interest.
The exact proportion did, however, vary depending on the total amounts borrowed and on the mix of currencies borrowed, which may not have been the same as the notional amounts of the interest rate swaps.

The weighted average effective interest rate on these investments is 9.7322% 2009: 6.311%.
The Company's fixed-income portfolio at the year-end was valued at 45,788,000 2009: 43,707,000 and it had a modified duration interest rate sensitivity of approximately 4.6 years 2009: 5.1 years.
A 1% increase or decrease in relevant market interest rates would be expected to increase or decrease the portfolio's value by approximately 2,098,000 2009: 2,218,000, all other factors being equal.
Market price risk The Company is an investment company and its investment portfolio is subject to fluctuations, volatility and the vagaries of market prices.
The Directors seek to mitigate this risk by ensuring proper controls exist through the Investment Management Agreement for maintaining a diversified portfolio of the securities of utility and utility-related companies and ensuring that there are balances within the portfolio by geography, sub-sector and types of instrument.
If the fair value of the Company's investments see portfolio holdings on pages 11 and 12 at the year-end had increased or decreased by 10% then it would have had an effect on the Company's capital return and equity equal to 55,513,000 or 26.39p per Ordinary Share 2009: 50,438,000 or 17.69p per Ordinary Share and 106.88p per Capital Share.

Unlisted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
The risk is taken into account by the Director's when arriving at their valuation of these items.

The fair value of the Company's unquoted investments is determined by the Directors using valuation methodologies in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
Valuation of financial instruments The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant assets as follows: Level 1 - valued using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 - valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data for the asset or liability.
The tables below set out fair value measurements of financial instruments as at the year-end, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.

Capital management policies and procedures The structure of the Company's capital is described in note 15 to the financial statements and details of the Company's reserves are shown in the statement of changes in equity on page 33.
The Company's capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: to achieve a high, secure dividend yield on its investment portfolio and to realise long-term growth in the capital value of the portfolio for the benefit of Shareholders, while taking care to preserve Shareholders' capital: and to maintain an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
In current market conditions, the Directors have authorised the Investment Manager to maintain gearing of up to 60%.
The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, regularly monitors and reviews the structure of the Company's capital.
These reviews include: the level of gearing, which takes account of the Company's position and the Investment Manager's views on the market: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Company's objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from last year.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements: as a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restrictions tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Company has complied with them at all times.
