FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28.
Acquisitions continued Other During 2009 the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Moorhouse Consulting and Ribbit Corporation, for a total consideration of 75m including 10m of deferred, contingent consideration.
The combined net assets acquired in these transactions and the goodwill arising were as follows: Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Intangible assets 2525 Receivables 2 2 Cash and cash equivalents 5 5 Payables 4 4 Net assets acquired 32528 Goodwill 47 Total consideration 75 Intangible assets recognised in respect of these acquisitions comprised internally developed technology.
Goodwill on the acquisitions principally related to cost savings and other synergies.
During 2010 the determination of fair values has been nalised and adjustments have been made to the balances previously reported.
Prior year balances have not been restated as the amount is not significant to the group.
Retirement benefit plans Background The group offers retirement benefit plans to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 when it was replaced by a dened contribution scheme, the BT Retirement Plan BTRP which was closed on 31 March 2009.
On 1 April 2009 BT set up the BT Retirement Saving Scheme, a contract based dened contribution arrangement, to which BTRP members were invited to transfer their accumulated assets.
The total pension cost of the group for 2010, included within staff costs, was 304m 2009: 544m, 2008: 626m.
The total cost associated with the groups dened benefit pension schemes for 2010 was 206m 2009: 459m, 2008: 576m.
Dened contribution schemes The income statement charge in respect of dened contribution schemes represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension cost for 2010 in respect of the groups main dened contribution scheme was 66m 2009: 47m, 2008: 37m and 6m 2009: 4m, 2008: 3m of contributions were outstanding at 31 March 2010.
Dened benefit schemes BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed of the BTPS, there are nine Trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including the Chairman of the Trustee.
Four Trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the Trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the Trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities IAS 19 Scheme assets are measured at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
The liabilities of the BTPS are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
Estimated future cash ows are discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of an equivalent term to the liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the pension obligations.
The discount rate has been assessed by reference to the duration of the BTPSs liabilities and by reference to the published iBoxx index of Sterling corporate bonds of duration greater than 15 years and investment grade AA and above.
Allowance is made where the constituent bonds in the published index have been re-rated or new issues made.
The rate of ination inuences the assumptions for salary and pension increase.
This has been assessed by reference to yields on longterm xed and index-linked Government bonds and has regard to Bank of England published inationary expectations.
Salary increases are assumed to be in line with ination.

Retirement benefit plans continued The financial assumptions used to measure the net pension obligation of the BTPS under IAS 19 at 31 March 2010 are as follows: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 At 31 March %%%%%% Rate used to discount liabilities 1.83 3.84 3.24 5.50 6.85 6.85 a a Average future increases in wages and salaries 0.75 3.60 2.90 4.28 Average increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.60 2.90 3.50 Ination average increase in retail price index n a n a n a 3.60 2.90 3.50 a There is a short-term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.5% for the first three years.
The assumptions about life expectancy have regard to information published by the UK actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau.
However, due to the size of the membership of the BTPS 333,000 members at 31 December 2009 it is considered appropriate for the life expectancy assumptions adopted to take in to account the actual membership experience.
Allowance is also made for future improvements in mortality.
The BTPS actuary undertakes formal reviews of the membership experience every three years.
The IAS 19 life expectancy assumptions reect the 2008 triennial funding valuation basis.
The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows: 2010 2009 Number of Number of years years Male in lower pay bracket 25.2 24.8 Male in higher pay bracket 27.4 27.1 Female 28.1 27.7 Future improvement every 10 years 1.1 1.0 Amounts recognised in respect of dened benefit schemes The net pension obligation is set out below: 2010 2009 Present Present value value Assets of liabilities Obligation Assets of liabilities Obligation At 31 March m m m m m m BTPS 35,278 43,018 7,740 29,227 33,070 3,843 a Other schemes 151 275 124 126 256 130 35,429 43,293 7,864 29,353 33,326 3,973 Deferred tax asset 2,193 1,103 Net pension obligation 5,671 2,870 a Included in the present value of liabilities of other schemes is 54m 2009: 52m related to unfunded schemes.

Retirement benefit plans continued The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index-linked securities, alternative assets, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, the schemes assets did not include any ordinary shares of the company.
However, the scheme held 52m 2009: 65m of bonds and 6m 2009: 5m of index-linked notes issued by the group.
The group occupies four 2009: two properties owned by the BTPS on which an annual rental of 0.2m is payable 2009: 0.1m.
The Trustees main investment objective is to ensure that over the long-term, and after allowing for all future income, the BTPS will always have sufficient liquid resources to meet the cost of benefit payments to be made as they fall due.
The strategic allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustees investment policy.
The targets set reect the Trustees views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking high returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be distributed to match its liabilities.
The targets are a long-term aim to be achieved over a period as and when favourable opportunities arise.
Current market conditions and trends are continuously assessed and short-term tactical shifts in asset allocation may be made around the long-term strategic target, for example, by using stock index future contracts.
The BTPS uses financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Exposure to interest rate uctuations on its borrowings and deposits is managed by using interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining a balance between continuity of funding and exibility through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities.
The BTPS has significant investments overseas, as a result of which the value of the schemes assets can be signicantly affected by movements in foreign currencies against Sterling.
A portion of the exposure to foreign currencies embedded in the overseas assets is hedged back into Sterling to remove some of the currency risk.
The assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return and the fair values of the assets of the BTPS at 31 March were: At 31 March 2010 At 31 March 2009 Expected Expected long-term long-term rate of return rate of return per annum Asset fair value Target per annum Asset fair value Target % bn % % % bn % % UK equities 8.5 3.6 10 11 8.5 3.2 11 11 Non-UK equities 8.5 7.5 21 22 8.5 5.9 20 22 Fixed-interest securities 5.0 5.9 17 20 5.9 6.6 22 20 Index-linked securities 4.2 5.8 16 15 4.0 4.4 15 15 Property 7.7 3.8 11 12 7.0 3.2 11 12 Alternative assets 6.9 5.9 17 20 7.0 5.2 18 20 Cash and other 4.2 2.8 8 3.5 0.8 3 6.5 35.3 100 100 6.7 29.3 100 100 The assumption for the expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The expected returns on xed interest and index-linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
Expected returns on equities, property and alternative asset classes are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds, consensus economic forecasts of future returns and historical returns.
Alternative asset classes include commodities, hedge funds, private equity, infrastructure and credit opportunities.
The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance expense.
The history of experience gains and losses are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 m m m m m Present value of dened benefit obligation 43,293 33,326 34,669 38,779 38,187 Fair value of plan assets 35,429 29,353 37,448 38,390 35,640 Net pension obligation asset 7,864 3,973 2,779 389 2,547 Experience adjustment on dened benefit obligation gain loss 1,632 238 22 190 527 Percentage of the present value of the dened benefit obligation 3.8% 0.7% 0.1% 0.5% 1.4% Experience adjustment on plan assets gain loss 5,157 9,451 2,572 993 4,855 Percentage of the plan assets 14.6% 32.2% 6.9% 2.6% 13.6% The group expects to contribute approximately 669m to the BTPS in 2011, including deficiency contributions of 525m.

Retirement benefit plans continued Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities The assumed discount rate, life expectancy and salary increases all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation of the pension obligations, and of the prospective 2011 income statement charge, to changes in these assumptions: Decrease Decrease Decrease increase in increase in increase in net liability service cost finance expense bn m m 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1.6 15 15 salary increases 0.2 15 Additional 1 year increase to life expectancy 1.0 10 55 0.1 percentage point increase in expected return on assets 35 The sensitivities relating to the discount rate, ination rate and expected return on assets in respect of the pension cost elements in the income statement are shown for information only.
The amounts that will be recognised in the income statement in 2011 are derived from market conditions at 1 April 2010.
Subsequent changes in market conditions will have no effect on the income statement in 2011 and will be reected as actuarial gains and losses in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Funding valuation and future funding obligations A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent Trustee by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The funding valuation is based on prudent assumptions and is performed at 31 December as this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The outcome of the latest triennial actuarial funding valuation at 31 December 2008 was announced on 11 February 2010, together with the agreement between BT and the Trustee of the BTPS to a recovery plan to make good the 9.0bn funding deficit.
Whilst the valuation and the recovery plan have been agreed with the Trustee, they are currently under review by the Pensions Regulator.
However, the Pensions Regulators initial view is that they have substantial concerns with certain features of the agreement.
BT and the Trustee continue to work with the Pensions Regulator to help them complete their detailed review.
The Pensions Regulator has indicated it will discuss its position with us once they have completed their review.
Accordingly, as matters stand, it is uncertain as to whether the Pensions Regulator will take any further action.
This uncertainty is outside of our control.
Since the valuation date the schemes assets have increased by 4.1bn and the Trustee estimates that if the funding valuation was performed at 31 December 2009 the deficit would have been about 7.5bn on this prudent valuation basis.
The last two triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2008 2005 2008 2005 valuation valuation valuation valuation %%%% Discount rate Pre retirement liabilities 3.65 3.06 6.76 5.84 Post retirement liabilities 2.15 1.79 5.21 4.54 Average increase in retail price index 3.00 2.70 Average future increases in wages and salaries 0.75 3.00 3.47 Average increase in pensions 3.00 2.70 At 31 December 2008 the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 31.2bn 2005: 34.4bn and were sufficient to cover 77.6% 2005: 90.9% of the benets accrued by that date.
This represented a funding deficit of 9.0bn compared with 3.4bn at 31 December 2005.
The funding valuation uses prudent assumptions.
In the three years ended 31 December 2008, the decline in the market value of assets combined with longer life expectancy assumptions signicantly increased the funding deficit, although the impact on the liabilities was reduced by the higher discount rate and favourable experience compared to other actuarial assumptions used at 31 December 2005.
Following the agreement of the valuation the ordinary contributions rate reduced to 13.6% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions from 19.5%, reecting the implementation of benefit changes with effect from 1 April 2009, following the UK pensions review.
In addition, the group will make deficit payments of 525m per annum for the first three years of the 17 year recovery plan, the first payment of which was made in December 2009.
The payment in the fourth year will be 583m, then increasing at 3% per annum.
The payments in years four to 17 are equivalent to 533m per annum in real terms.
Under the 2005 valuation deficit contributions were 280m per annum for 10 years.
In 2010, the group made regular contributions of 384m 2009: 433m and deficit contributions of 525m.
No deficit contributions were made in 2009 as they were paid in advance during 2008.
