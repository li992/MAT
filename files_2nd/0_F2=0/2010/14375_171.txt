Options granted under the executive plans are valued using a binomialmodel.
Options granted under employee plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management consider that options granted under these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
Options granted under each plans are valued separately and a weighted average fairvalue calculated.
The binomial model is used for executive plans so that proper allowance is made for the possibility of early exercise.
At the 2010 grant management expected 90% of the options granted under the 2001 Executive Scheme to vest 2009 95%, 2008 95% and 90% of the 2004 Executive Scheme to vest 2009 60%, 2008 60%.
Each year an assessment is made of the current vesting estimates and they are updated to reflect revised expectations of the number of grants that willvest.
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
