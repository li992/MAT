260 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 41 Financial guarantees and options This note details the financial guarantees and options we have given for some of our insurance and investment products.
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Further information on assumptions is given in notes 39 and 40. a UK Life with-profit business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of FSA liabilities.
Under the FSAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
For some unitised with-profit life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in RPI CPI.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.
iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the UK with-profit funds were 823 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 760 million.
With the exception of the New With-Profits Sub Fund NWPSF, movements in the realistic liabilities in the with-profit funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the unallocated divisible surplus, with no net impact on IFRS profit.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the NWPSF were 131 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 109 million.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.
In addition, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit mortgage endowments.
Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.
For UKLAP WP policyholders, these payments are subject to certain conditions.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 under FSA Policy Statement 06 14 Prudential Changes for Insurers.
i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 31 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 28 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
c Overseas life businesses In addition to guarantees written in the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
No PAF was established at the end of 2010.
Financial statements IFRS 261 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 41 Financial guarantees and options continued The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 34 billion at 31 December 2010 2009: 33 billion.
Up to 2010, the guaranteed bonus on this contract equalled 75% of the average of the last two years declared bonus rates.
Starting from year end 2010, Aviva France and the AFER association will agree the guaranteed bonus on this contract at every year end for the following year.
This bonus was 3.55% for 2010 2009: 3.67% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 4.01% 2009: 4.62%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 13 billion at 31 December 2010 2009: 12 billion and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5%.
Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the end of 2010 for this guarantee is 85 million 2009: 97 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2010, total sums at risk for these contracts were 242 million 2009: 372 million out of total unit-linked funds of 14 billion 2009: 14 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 54.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 93 million 2009: 71 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 22 million 2009: 25 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2010 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Delta Lloyd Guaranteed minimum return at maturity In the Netherlands, it is market practice to guarantee a minimum return at maturity on traditional savings and pension contracts.
Guarantees on older lines of business are 4% per annum, while for business written since 1 September 1999, the guarantee is 3% per annum.
On Group pensions business, it is often possible to recapture guarantee costs through adjustments to surrender values or to premium rates.
On transition to IFRS, Delta Lloyd changed the reserving basis for most traditional contracts to reflect current market interest rates, for consistency with the reporting of assets at market value.
The cost of meeting interest rate guarantees is allowed for directly in the liabilities.
Although most traditional contracts are valued at market interest rate, the split by level of guarantee shown below is according to the original underlying guarantee.
The total liabilities for traditional business at 31 December 2010 are 13 billion 2009: 13 billion analysed as follows: Liabilities 3% guarantee 2010 2009 m m Individual 2,216 2,206 Group pensions 869 780 Total 3,085 2,986 Liabilities 4% guarantee 2010 2009 m m Individual 3,447 3,690 Group pensions 6,274 6,329 Total 9,721 10,019 Delta Lloyd has certain unit-linked contracts which provide a guaranteed minimum return at maturity from 4% pa to 2% pa.
Provisions consist of unit values plus an additional reserve for the guarantee.
The additional provision for the guarantee was 88 million 2009: 148 million.
An additional provision of 15 million 2009: 33 million in respect of investment return guarantees on group segregated fund business is held.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 106 million 2009: 180 million if yields were to reduce by 1% pa and by 37 million 2009: 42 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2010 levels.
iii Ireland Guaranteed annuity options Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 236 million 2009: 214 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality option take-up and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives swaptions.
The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benefits so there is reduced exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.
262 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 41 Financial guarantees and options continued No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently in-the-money by 13 million 2009: 10 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is usually sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
There is no sensitivity to either interest rates or equity markets since there is no longer any exposure to equity in these funds and a matching strategy has been implemented for bonds.
Return of premium guarantee Until 2005, Aviva Life and Pensions Ireland wrote two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee, or a price floor guarantee, after five or six years.
The first tranche has now expired.
The provision for the second tranche over and above unit and sterling reserves, at the end of 2010 is 9 million 2009: 11 million.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 3 million 2009: 4 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from the year end 2010 levels.
However, the provision increase would be broadly off-set by an increase in the value of the hedging assets that were set up on sale of these policies.
We would not expect any significant impact on this provision as a result of interest rate movements.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 0.5 million 2009: 2 million if property values were to decline by 10% from year end 2010 levels.
This would be offset by an increase in the value of the hedging assets by 0.5 million 2009: 0.4 million, the difference reflecting the fact that only the second tranche was hedged for property exposure.
iv Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2010, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 4 billion 2009: 3 billion with a further reserve of 12 million 2009: 11 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 11 billion 2009: 9 billion, with a further provision of 46 million 2009: 69 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 43 million 2009: 46 million in Spain and 7 million 2009: 21 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2010 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.6% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
v United States Indexed and total return strategy products In the United States, the Group writes indexed life and deferred annuity products.
These products guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on certain indices, primarily the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Stock Price Index.
A portion of each premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the policyholder.
The derivatives held by the Group and the options embedded in the policy are both carried at fair value.
The US Treasury swap curve plus a risk adjustment of 1.47% 2009: 1.87% for indexed life and 1.48% 2009: 1.65% for indexed deferred annuities is used as the discount rate to calculate the fair value of the embedded options.
The risk adjustment calculation is based on market spreads on senior long-term unsecured Aviva plc debt with a reduction to reflect policyholder priority over other creditors in case of default.
The amount of change in the fair value of these embedded options resulting from the risk adjustment in 2010 is an increase of 216 million 2009: 313 million, and is principally attributable to market factors rather than instrument specific credit risk.
At 31 December 2010, the total liabilities for indexed products were 20 billion 2009: 17 billion, including liabilities for the embedded option of 2.5 billion 2009: 1.7 billion.
If interest rates were to increase by 1%, the provision for embedded options would decrease by 151 million 2009: 59 million and, if interest rates were to decrease by 1%, the provision would increase by 167 million 2009: 86 million.
The Group has certain products that credit interest based on a total return strategy, whereby policyholders are allowed to allocate their premium payments to different asset classes within the general account.
The Group guarantees a minimum return of premium plus approximately 3% interest over the term of the contracts.
The linked general account assets are fixed maturity securities, and both the securities and the contract liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2010, the liabilities for total return strategy products were 1.0 billion 2009: 1.2 billion.
The Group offers an optional lifetime guaranteed income benefit focused on the retirement income segment of the deferred annuity marketplace to help customers manage income during both the accumulation stage and the distribution stage of their financial life.
At 31 December 2010, a total of 8.9 billion 2009: 4.9 billion in indexed deferred annuities have elected this benefit, taking steps to guarantee retirement income.
