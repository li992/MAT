Financial statements Notes on financial statements 19.
Taxation continued The group has recognized significant costs in the year in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Tax has been calculated on the expenditures that qualify for tax relief at the US statutory tax rate.
A deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of provisions for future expenditure that are expected to qualify for tax relief.
This is included under the heading decommissioning, environmental and other provisions and has resulted in a significant reduction in the overall deferred tax liability of the group compared to 2009.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
a At 31 December 2010, the group had approximately $3.9 billion 2009 $4.8 billion of carry-forward tax losses, predominantly in Europe, that would be available to offset against future taxable profit.
A deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of $3.0 billion of losses 2009 $3.2 billion.
No a deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of $0.9 billion of losses 2009 $1.6 billion.
Substantially all the tax losses have no fixed expiry date.
At 31 December 2010, the group had approximately $13.9 billion of unused tax credits predominantly in the UK and US 2009 $12.5 billion.
At 31 December 2010 there is a deferred tax asset of $2.1 billion in respect of unused tax credits 2009 $1.0 billion.
No deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of $11.8 billion of tax credits 2009 $11.5 billion.
In 2010 $0.3 billion of tax credits were utilized on which a deferred tax asset had not previously been recognized.
In 2009 a change in UK legislation repealed double taxation relief in relation to foreign dividends, onshore pooling and utilization of eligible unrelieved foreign tax eliminating the associated tax credits.
The UK tax credits, arising in UK branches overseas, with no deferred tax asset, amounting to $9.9 billion 2009 $9.5 billion, do not have a fixed expiry date.
In addition there are also temporary differences in overseas branches of UK companies with no deferred tax asset recognized.
At 31 December 2010 the unrecognized deferred tax amounted to $0.9 billion 2009 $0.5 billion.
These credits and temporary differences arise in UK branches predominantly based in high tax rate jurisdictions so are unlikely to have value in the future as UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by double tax relief on the local foreign tax.
The US tax credits with no deferred tax asset, amounting to $1.9 billion 2009 $2.0 billion expire 10 years after generation, and the majority expire in the period 2014-2018.
The other major components of temporary differences at the end of 2010 are tax depreciation, provisions and other items in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, US inventory holding gains classified as other taxable temporary differences and pension plan and other post-retirement benefit plan deficits.
In 2010 there are no material temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and equity accounted entities for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized.
In 2010 the enactment of a 1% reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax on profits arising from activities outside the North Sea has reduced the deferred tax charge by $86 million.
In 2009 there were no changes in the statutory tax rates that materially impacted the groups tax charge.
a 2009 comparative data has been amended.
Dividends Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the agreement to establish the $20-billion trust fund, the BP board reviewed its dividend policy and decided to cancel the previously announced first-quarter 2010 ordinary share dividend scheduled for payment on 21 June 2010, and further decided that no ordinary share dividends would be paid in respect of the second and third quarters of 2010.
On 1 February 2011, BP announced the resumption of quarterly dividend payments.
The quarterly dividend to be paid on 28 March 2011 is 7 cents per ordinary share $0.42 per American Depositary Share ADS.
The corresponding amount in sterling will be announced on 14 March 2011.
A scrip dividend alternative is available, allowing shareholders to elect to receive their dividend in the form of new ordinary shares and ADS holders in the form of new ADSs.
The group does not account for dividends until they are paid.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 do not reflect the dividend announced on 1 February 2011 and payable in March 2011: this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ended 31 December 2011.
