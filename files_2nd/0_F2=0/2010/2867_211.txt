The tax charge is equivalent to an effective tax rate of 24.1% 2009: 26.8%.
The effective tax rate on underlying profit is 24.5% 2009: 26.8%.

Deferred income tax Deferred income tax at 31 December relates to the following: Consolidated balance sheet Consolidated income statement 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated capital allowances 10.4 13.5 0.7 11.6 Cash flow hedges 3.1 3.0 Fair value adjustments on acquisition 55.3 35.3 11.9 9.0 68.8 51.8 Deferred tax assets Share based payments 4.9 6.7 2.9 2.7 Pension schemes liability 6.7 8.9 5.0 14.2 Provisions 14.6 12.8 3.0 4.9 Losses available for offset against future taxable income 0.2 1.5 0.7 Mark to market movement on currency swaps 0.7 0.7 0.7 Cash flow swaps 10.1 8.6 1.6 0.3 37.0 37.9 Net deferred tax liability 31.8 13.9 Deferred income tax credit expense 6.2 9.5 The Group has tax losses and other temporary differences of 85.3m 2009: 55.2m that are available for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses or other temporary differences arose: of which 81.8m are related to losses incurred by companies acquired by the Group and therefore not as a result of the Groups trading performance.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of 85.3m 2009: 54.5m of these losses or other temporary differences, as their recoverability is uncertain.
The UK corporation tax rate will decrease from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
The deferred tax balance has been adjusted in the current year to reflect this change.
Proposed changes to tax laws and rates that will have an effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group have also been announced but not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The impact of these changes on the Group is not considered to be material.
