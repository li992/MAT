Prior period adjustment In 2009 and prior years, the F&C REIT minority interest put options were included in the Balance Sheet at the gross value of the option liability.

This includes a number of vacant or sub-let properties which were either previously occupied or are partially occupied by the Company.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments, where significant, after taking into account existing and expected sub-tenant contractual arrangements.
The remaining terms are for up to 10 years.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases and sub-leases are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time including market rent reviews and break options within the lease arrangements.
In addition, exposure could exist if an existing tenant defaulted or went into liquidation or administration.
The amount included within the Profit and Loss Account in respect of unwinding of the discount on onerous premises provisions in 2010 is 0.4m 2009: 0.1m.
Pension Plan guarantee The Company has agreed to provide the F&C Asset Management Pension Plan FCAM Plan Trustees with a guarantee that should F&C Asset Management Services Limited become insolvent, the Company will guarantee an amount up to the lower of the cost of securing members benefits with an insurance company over the assets of the FCAM Plan the solvency deficit and 120.0m.
The provision represents the actuarial estimate of the fair value of the guarantee at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
Investment Trust VAT During 2007, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC agreed that asset management services to UK Investment Trust Companies ITCs should be exempt from VAT.
The Company, in common with other asset managers in the UK, received claims from ITCs for the repayment of VAT charged to them for historic periods dating back to 1990.
While the Company charged VAT in accordance with applicable UK law at the time, a provision was recognised in 2007 to the extent that the expected payments to be made to ITCs were greater than the expected amount recoverable from HMRC.
In early 2009 all amounts due to ITCs by the Company were settled and the excess of the provision of 0.7m was released to the Profit and Loss Account.
No provision is therefore required at 31 December 2009 or 2010.
Deferred tax The deferred tax provision relates to short-term timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of when timing differences might reverse.
The provision relates to the revaluation of available for sale assets, which is recognised as a separate component of reserves.
A further analysis of deferred taxation is disclosed in note 13.

Provisions for liabilities continued Put option guarantee Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 82 outlines the circumstances surrounding the put option notice received from, and other claims made by, the two founder members of F&C Partners LLP Partners, the Groups majority-owned fund of hedge funds business, together with the quantum of the provision recognised.
A provision of 2.4m was recognised in respect of these matters during 2009 in the Financial Statements of F&C Alternative Investment Holdings Limited F&C AIH, a subsidiary company and the corporate member of Partners.
The Company, through the Partnership Agreement, has guaranteed any amounts validly due to the founder members in respect of the put option to the extent that F&C AIH is unable to meet such obligations.
A corresponding provision of 2.4m was recognised in the Companys Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2009.
However, the provision was released in 2010 as it is now expected that F&C AIH has sufficient resources available to it to meet any amount payable in respect of a valid put option claim by the two founder members of Partners.
Therefore no provision is recognised in the Company Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2010 in respect of this matter.

As at 31 December 2010, the value of this commitment is estimated at 54.0 million.

Contingent liabilities Ongoing business operations In the normal course of its business, the Company is subject to matters of litigation or dispute.
While there can be no assurances, at this time the Directors believe, based on the information currently available to them, that it is not probable that the ultimate outcome of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.
Post Balance Sheet Events Factors affecting future tax charges The Chancellor of the Exchequer's Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK Corporation Tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of 4 years from 2011.
The first reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate from 28% to 27% was substantially enacted on 20 July 2010 and is effective from 1 April 2011.
Accordingly, this will reduce the Company's current tax charge in future.
This rate change has reduced the net deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2010 by 0.1m.
A further 1% reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate was announced in the Chancellor's Budget of 23 March 2011.
This was subsequently enacted on 29 March 2011 and will take the Corporation Tax rate down to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
It is estimated that the effect of this additional 1% rate change will lead to a further reduction in the Company's net deferred tax asset of 0.1m.
The Directors are of the view that due to the significant level of estimation required it is not yet possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the proposed subsequent 3% rate reduction in future years, although this will further reduce the Company's current tax charge in future and reduce the Company's deferred tax assets liabilities recognised in the Balance Sheet.
Parent undertaking and controlling party In the opinion of the Directors, the Company has no ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party.
