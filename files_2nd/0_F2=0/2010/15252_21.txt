Synergy Health plc 58 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 28 March 2010 1 General information Synergy Health plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group deliver a range of specialist outsourced services to healthcare providers and other customers concerned with health management.
The Company is registered in the United Kingdom under company registration number 3355631 and its registered of ce is Ground Floor Stella, Windmill Hill Business Park, Whitehill Way, Swindon, Wilts, SN5 6NX.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to the nearest weekend to 31 March each year.
The current accounting period, and the comparative accounting period, are 52 weeks in length.
The 2010 financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds and have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the EU Adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 92 to 101.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
On transition to IFRS the following exemptions allowed under IFRS 1 were adopted: Business combinations The Group has elected to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to the LIPS Textielservice Holding BV business combination that took place on 8 July 2004. Business combinations which took place before 8 July 2004 have not been restated.
Share-based payments The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payments only to share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 3 April 2005.
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment The Group has elected to take advantage of this exemption and therefore all previously revalued assets have been held at their UK GAAP carrying value as at 3 April 2005.
These values have been treated as deemed cost.
Employee bene ts actuarial gains and losses The Group has elected to take advantage of this exemption such that all cumulative actuarial gains and loses up to 3 April 2005 have been taken to reserves in full.
Accumulated translation reserve The Group has elected to take advantage of the exemption and has absorbed historic differences into reserves.
Basis of consolidation Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Jointly-controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of the entities assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, with items of a similar nature on a line-by-line basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classi ed as available for sale.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chief Executives review, and the financial position of the Group and its cash ows and borrowing requirements are described in the Finance Directors report, both of which are set out in the Business review of the Annual Report.
The Finance Directors report and note 19 to the financial statements include the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, financial risks and hedging activities together with its exposure to credit and liquidity risks.
The current global economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over the level of demand for the Groups products, the price of its raw materials for certain business areas, and the carrying value of Group debt denominated in foreign currency.
The directors have reviewed the Groups medium-term forecasts through to June 2011 along with reasonable possible changes in trading performance and foreign exchange rates arising from these uncertainties to determine whether the committed banking facilities are suf cient to support the Groups projected liquidity requirements, and whether the forecast earnings are suf cient to meet the covenants associated with the banking facilities.
The Groups committed banking facilities are due for renewal in January 2012 and the directors have good reasons to believe that they will be renewed.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Synergy Health plc 59 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 2 Accounting policies continued Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Provisional fair value allocations are reviewed and if necessary adjusted no later than one year from the acquisition date.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in pro t or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to bene t from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the pro t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are inde nite.
Intangible assets with an inde nite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Intangible assets with a nite life are tested for impairment if there is indication of impairment.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives of the identi ed intangible assets are as follows: Customer-related intangibles 515 years Trade names 10 years Costs incurred in setting up long-term agreements are capitalised as intangible assets and amortised over the life of the contract to which the costs relate.
Technology licences are amortised from the date that they generate economic bene t and over the period of that bene t. Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of services but sometimes goods are also supplied, usually as part of a service offering.
Revenue is recognised once the service has been completed and the Group has transferred the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer.
The Group does not participate in activities which need to be accounted for under long-term contract accounting rules.
Finance charges and income Interest charges and income are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Financing transaction costs that relate to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense by reference to the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate.
Leasing Leases are classi ed as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classi ed as operating leases.
The Group as lessee Assets held under hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Bene ts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Synergy Health plc 60 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statement of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in pro t or loss for the period.
In order to manage its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options see below for the details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates uctuate signi cantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classi ed as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of speci c borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Government grants Government grants towards staff retraining costs are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to pro t or loss over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating pro t Operating pro t is stated before investment income and finance costs and before any pro t losses on business disposals.
Retirement bene t costs Payments to fide ned contribution retirement bene t schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement bene t schemes are dealt with as payments to fide ned contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a fide ned contribution retirement bene t scheme.
For fide ned bene t schemes, the cost of providing bene ts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and presented in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the bene ts are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the bene ts become vested.
The retirement bene t obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro t for the year.
Taxable pro t differs from net pro t as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Synergy Health plc 61 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 2 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affect neither accounting nor taxable pro t. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of services or goods, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at their book value, being cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write-off the cost over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with the exception of Cobalt, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Leasehold improvements Period of lease Plant and machinery 520 years Of ce equipment 35 years Motor vehicles 35 years Cobalt 15 years Circulating inventory 15 years Cobalt is depreciated over 15 years as follows.
The reducing balance is used for the first eight years.
The residual net book value at the end of year eight is then depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining seven years of the assets useful life.
Potential decommissioning costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated residual working life of the cobalt on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding provision is recognised in the balance sheet.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Circulating inventory mainly comprises linen textile assets provided to customers on a rental service basis in the Healthcare Solutions business.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an inde nite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Investment property Investment properties are properties land and buildings which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the buildings over 50 years.
Synergy Health plc 62 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-derivative financial assets which arise when the Group provides goods or services directly to a debtor and where there is no intention of trading the financial asset.
The receivables are initially recognised at fair value.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when objective evidence is received that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigni cant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash ow statements, overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are netted off against cash.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classi ed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in pro t or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Derivate financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses oating to xed interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage these exposures.
Some of these contracts are designated as cash ow hedges under IAS 39.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivate financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows or against net investment in overseas subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net pro t or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer quali es for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net pro t or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not clearly related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where appropriate.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 3 April 2005.
Synergy Health plc 63 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 2 Accounting policies continued The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model, except for the Long-term Incentive Plan awards which are subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition where a model following similar principles to the Monte Carlo approach is used.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The directors are of the opinion that they have made no judgements which have a signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Where estimates and associated assumptions are made they are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key areas of estimate uncertainty are set out below.
In relation to the Groups cobalt provision costs of future disposal are based on contractual arrangements with third parties and latest disposal cost estimates.
The Group cobalt depreciation policy is based on the actual physical decay of the Cobalt 60 isotope.
In relation to the Groups property, plant and equipment note 13, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Impairment tests have been undertaken with respect to goodwill note 11 using commercial judgement and a number of assumptions and estimates have been made to support their carrying amounts.
In relation to the Groups fide ned bene t pension schemes, actuarial assumptions are established using relevant market benchmark data and with the advice of external quali ed actuaries.
Adoption of new standards: In the current year, the Group has adopted the following new standards and interpretations: IFRS 8 Operating Segments introduces the management approach to segment reporting.
This requires the disclosure of segmental information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is deemed to be the Board of Directors, in order to assess each segments performance and allocate resources to them.
This standard amends the requirements for disclosure of segmental performance and does not have any effect on the Groups overall reported results.
IFRS 8 requires the Group to provide an explanation of the basis on which the segment information is prepared and a reconciliation to the amount recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Revised IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 2007 introduces the term total comprehensive income, which represents changes in equity during a period other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners.
The new statement of comprehensive income may be presented as either a single statement of comprehensive income which combines the requirements of the existing income statement and statement of recognised income and expense, or an income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has decided to present separate statements.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations clari es the fide nition of vesting conditions, introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions, requires non-vesting conditions to be re ected in grant date fair value and provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions and cancellations.
There was no material effect to the Group as a result of the amendment.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation requires puttable instruments, and instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another on a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation, to be classi ed as equity if certain conditions are met.
The amendments have had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 14 Limit on a fide ned bene t asset Surpluses in schemes are recognised as assets only if they represent unconditional economic bene ts available to the Group in the future.
Provision is made for future unrecognisable surpluses that will arise as a result of regulatory funding requirements.
Movements in unrecognised surpluses are included in the statement of recognised income and expense.
If the fair value of the assets exceeds the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation then the surplus will only be recognised if the nature of the arrangements under the trust deed, and funding arrangements between the Trustee and the Company support the availability of refunds or recoverability through agreed reductions in future contributions.
In addition, if there is a consecutive obligation for the Company to pay fide cit funding, this is also recognised.
The adoption of this standard has had no effect in these financial statements.
Synergy Health plc 64 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised The revised standard prohibits the immediate expensing of borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset.
The adoption of this standard has had no effect on these financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosures Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments The IASB amended IFRS 7 to enhance disclosures about fair value measurements of financial instruments and over liquidity risk which have been re ected in these financial statements.
Adopted IFRSs not yet applied The IFRSs adopted by the EU applied by the Group in the preparation of these financial statements are those that were effective for the year ended 28 March 2010.
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption but have not yet been applied by the Group in these financial statements: Endorsed Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 incorporates certain changes that amend the Groups current accounting policies in respect of business combinations, the main change being that transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred.
Revised IFRS 3 becomes mandatory for the Groups 2011 consolidated financial statements and will be applied prospectively.
Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 addresses changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries by the Group.
The amendments to IAS 27 become mandatory for the Groups 2011 consolidated financial statements are not expected to have a signi cant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements provides guidance on certain recognition and measurement issues that arise in accounting for public-to-private service concession arrangements.
There will be no impact upon the financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement permits reclassi cation of non-derivate financial assets out of the fair value through pro t or loss category in particular circumstances.
This amendment is not expected to have a signi cant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation, IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non Cash Assets to Owners and IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers.
There will be no impact upon the financial statements from these interpretations.
Amendment to IAS 32 about Classi cation of Rights Issues requires that if rights issues offered for a xed amount of foreign currency rights are issued pro rata to existing shareholders they should be classi ed as equity regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Group Cash Settled Share-based Payment Transactions.
The IASB amended IFRS 2 to require an entity receiving goods or services receiving entity in either an equity-settled or a cash-settled share-based payment transaction to account for the transaction in its separate or individual financial statements.
This principle even applies if another group entity or shareholder settles the transaction settling entity and the receiving entity has no obligation to settle the payment.
Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of Minimum Funding Requirement.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments.
Management is currently assessing the impact of these standards and interpretations on the financial statements.
These amendments and the new standards are not expected to impact the Group signi cantly, although additional disclosure may be required.
3 Segmental information The Group is organised into three operating segments, and information on these segments is reported to the chief operating decision maker CODM for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance.
These three operating segments are: the UK and Ireland, Europe and Middle East, and Asia and Africa.
The segments derive their revenues from the same range of products and services being the provision of healthcare services, sterilisation services, decontamination services.

The costs include future liabilities under the property lease.
The costs associated with the partial closure of the Harwell sterilisation facility include staff redundancy costs, decommissioning costs, and future liabilities under the property lease.
Both closures are part of a programme of cost rationalisation in the UK business.
Other restructuring costs have been incurred to generate ongoing reductions in the operating cost base in order to restore operating margins throughout the Groups businesses.
We have also recognised a non-recurring tax credit of 3,020,000.
This relates to a tax credit received on a foreign exchange movement on inter-company Sterling borrowings within a Euro-denominated legal entity.
Tax clearances have been received by the Dutch and UK authorities, and we have also received the associated repayment.
The foreign exchange movement on which the tax credit was derived was taken direct to equity in accordance with applicable international accounting standards.
The total impact of non-recurring items to pro t after tax is a credit of 1,700,000.
In the prior year, non-recurring items of 3,996,000 were charged in arriving at operating pro t. The table and accompanying notes provide further details: 000 Advisors costs and fees for admission to full list of LSE and rebranding exercise 810 Closure of a UK linen management facility 1,219 Closure of two Dutch linen management facilities 507 Costs of pursuing Dunstable re legal claim 280 Other restructuring costs 1,180 3,996 The costs associated with closing a UK linen management facility included future liabilities under the property lease.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as shown in the table below.
This table also provides the assumptions used by management in assessing the carrying value of these amounts: 2010 2009 Pre-tax Long-term Pre-tax Long-term discount growth discount growth rate rates rate rates % % 000 % % 000 UK segment Healthcare solutions 10.6 25 23,156 10.9 5 23,156 Decontamination services 10.4 5 4,654 10.9 46 4,654 Sterilisation services 10.3 5 33,185 10.9 5 33,516 Rest of Europe segment Healthcare solutions 10.1 34 29,928 10.9 34 30,858 Sterilisation services 9.8 5 80,825 10.9 5 82,997 Rest of World a single CGU 10.1 8 23,030 10.9 8 21,933 194,778 197,114 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a CGU, to their recoverable amount based on a value in use calculation.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment results.
During the year the goodwill for each CGU was separately assessed and tested for impairment, with nil 2009: nil impairment charges resulting.
As part of testing goodwill for impairment, detailed forecasts of operating cash ows for a period of five years are derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management.
Cash ows for the period beyond the financial forecasts are extrapolated based on estimates of future growth rates as disclosed above.
For each CGU the future growth rates used in the recoverable amount calculation do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets to which the CGU is dedicated.
A number of key assumptions are used as part of impairment testing.
These key assumptions are made by management re ecting past experience combined with their knowledge as to future performance and relevant external sources of information.
In determining the recoverable amount of each CGU the key assumptions are discount rate, long-term growth rate, future sales prices and volumes, new business won and the cost structure of each business.
Sensitivity analysis as at 28 March 2010 has indicated that no reasonable foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model will result in a signi cant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
The Group has pledged land and buildings having a carrying amount of approximately 18.8 million 2009: 18.5 million to secure banking facilities and other loans granted to the Group.
At 28 March 2010, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to 8.0 million 2009: 7.5 million.
Included in the cost of property, plant and equipment is 805,000 2009: 599,000 of capitalised interest.

Bank loans under the main syndicated facility of 160 million are due for renewal on 15 January 2012 and all fall due for repayment in total on that date.
These loans attract a oating rate of interest although xing arrangements have been entered into as described in note 19.
Certain Euro-denominated loans outside of the main syndicated facility totalling 9.6 million are secured by mortgages on certain Dutch freehold properties.
The loans attract both oating and xed rates of interest.
At 28 March 2010 the Group had available 60.9 million of undrawn committed borrowing facility.
In addition the Group had undrawn overdraft and other uncommitted facilities totalling 14 million of which it expects to renew 11 million during the financial year.

Synergy Health plc 76 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19 Financial instruments Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
a Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
b Interest rate risk The Group is subject to uctuations in interest rates on its loans and surplus cash deposits.
At 28 March 2010 the Group held hedging arrangements in order to x the interest charge on 38.4 million of its debt.
The swap arrangements cover: Debt covered Millions Fixed rate Expiry 14.75 4.32% 14 December 2010 5.00 4.13% 31 March 2010 1.50 4.76% 3 May 2011 10.00 2.30% 13 January 2012 Amounts to be paid or received under these arrangements will be recognised in the interest expense consistent with the terms of the agreement.
The expiry of each agreement is disclosed in the table above.
The arrangements are fully effective in xing the interest on the underlying debt.
In revaluing them to fair value, the Group has recognised 619,000 in current liabilities and equity.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates on the element of the total Group interest which is not subject to xed interest arrangements.
The reasonable change is based on the difference between current market interest rates and one year forward rates: Effect on pro t after tax and Increase decrease equity in basis points 000 2010 87 87 881 881 2009 43 43 314 314 Synergy Health plc 77 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 19 Financial instruments continued c Foreign currency risk The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk where it has investment in overseas operations which are affected by foreign exchange movements.
The Group is not exposed to signi cant transactional foreign currency risk in respect of its overseas operations.
Whilst the exposure is limited, the Groups principal currency exposure is to uctuations in the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro.
During the 12 months to March 2010 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro weakened by 7% in comparison to the 12-month average to March 2009.
A 7% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro over the entire year to March 2010 would have resulted in increased pro t after tax of 691,000 2009: 697,000.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 7% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro would have an equal but opposite effect.
The Board considers that the costs of mitigating any exposure to movements in foreign currency earnings from subsidiaries currently would outweigh the bene ts.
Where the Group subsidiaries make signi cant purchases in non-functional currencies, such as US and Canadian Dollars, the Group enters into forward exchange currency contracts to manage this exposure.
During the 12 months to March 2010 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar has weakened by 9% in comparison to the 12 months average to March 2009.
A 9% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar over the entire year to March 2010 would have resulted in reduced pro t after tax of 434,000 2009: 503,000.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
A 7% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar would have an equal but opposite effect.
Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge signi cant future transactions and cash ows in foreign currencies and is a party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are denominated in the functional currencies of the Groups trading entities and its suppliers.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge speci c exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the underlying hedged item until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
Additionally, the Group holds Euro denominated loans in UK companies totalling 63 million 2009: 117 million.
This represents a fully effective designated net investment hedge against the first 63 million of the Groups Euro denominated net assets of 194.4 million 2009: 240.0 million.
The revaluation of these loans resulted in a gain of 4.8 million 2009: loss of 11.0 million which has been posted to the translation reserve.
d Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for impairment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no signi cant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Financial risk management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Management has credit policies in place to manage risk and to monitor exposure to risk on an ongoing basis.
These include the use of customer speci c credit limits based on third party credit reports and in cases of customer default or requests for credit above agreed limits the use of pro forma invoices to secure payment in advance of delivery.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was 46,326,000 2009: 48,470,000 being the total trade receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
The Groups customer base mainly comprises major medical device companies, commercial distributors, NHS Trusts and healthcare providers, including public sector, private sector and charitable organisations, throughout the UK, Europe and the Rest of the World.
No single customer or top 10 customer grouping accounts for a signi cant proportion of the Groups trade receivables.
The Group has in place an insurance policy to cover the majority of its Healthcare solutions UK export customers.

No further analysis has been provided for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables from Group companies, other trade receivables and other financial assets as there is limited exposure to credit risk and no provisions for impairment have been recognised.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Details of the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities are given in note 18.
Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are: i. to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and bene ts to other stakeholders, and ii.
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by a pricing products and services commensurate with the level of risk and b ensuring returns on new investment programmes will maintain or increase shareholder returns.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares, if required.
The acquisition of Isotron in 2007 was partially funded by issue of equity to maintain an appropriate capital structure for the Group.

Synergy Health plc 86 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Share-based payments continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP for executive directors and senior executives was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 28 June 2005.
All executive directors and senior executives nominated by the Remuneration Committee are entitled to be considered for the grant of awards under the LTIP.
The awards take the form of an option over shares, where granting the option is conditional upon the performance of the Company over the measurement period.
An award made under the LTIP to a nominated participant will take two forms.
a The first type of award is a right to acquire a speci ed number of shares by way of an option LTIP Option, with award conditional upon the performance of the Company over the measurement period.
Other than the initial award, the policy will be to make maximum awards not exceeding 200% of basic salary.
The maximum initial award made in July 2005 in respect of R M Steeves and I M Jacques was 450% of basic salary.
The vesting of the shares will be dependent on the extent to which the following performance targets have been satis ed: i 50% of the LTIP Option is determined by a comparison of the earnings per share gure at the end of the measurement period with that at the start.
For these purposes earnings per share will be adjusted for goodwill, non-recurring items, share option charges and any other items deemed reasonable by the Remuneration Committee.
ii The other 50% of the LTIP Option is determined by the Total Shareholder Return TSR generated by the Company in comparison to that generated by companies in the FTSE Small Companies excluding investment trusts Index.
A table ranking the companies in order of performance will be produced in July of each year of the measurement period, the ranking of the Company in that table will be established.
b The second type of award takes the form of a co-invest arrangement and requires that the participant to whom the award is to be made invests in Shares in the Company and continues to hold those shares throughout the measurement period LTIP co-invest.
At the end of the measurement period, depending upon the growth in earnings per share adjusted as above of the Company over the measurement period, the participant will receive a number of matching shares at nominal value under the LTIP co-invest.

The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is 0.5 million.
During the year ended 29 March 2009 options were granted on 30 June 2008, 16 July 2008 and 30 October 2008.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on this date is 1.0 million.
The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year is 4.94 2009: 2.95.
The fair value of an award of shares under the LTIP has been adjusted to take into account TSR as a market-based performance condition, using a pricing model that takes into account expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the comparator group.
The model follows similar principles as the Monte Carlo approach and takes into account that TSR vesting and share price performance are not independent.
The inputs into the fair value models are as follows: 2010 2009 Weighted average share price 5.21 7.28 Weighted average exercise price 0.01 0.01 Expected volatility 39.86% 22.9% Expected life in years 3.0 3.0 Risk free rate 2.23% 5.08% Dividend yield 1.77% 1.29% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years at the date of grant.

Scheme 5 Lips Textielservice LTS participates in a multi-employer industry-wide fide ned bene t scheme.
The plan is managed by the industry pension fund and obligations are reinsured.
In the event that there is an under-funding position the trustees of the scheme can take a range of actions including increasing employee contributions and reducing member bene ts as well as asking employers to increase their contributions.
LTS is unable to identify the Companys share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan because the plan is industry-wide and cannot accurately determine the Companys share of the overall surplus fide cit of the plan.
However, to the extent that a surplus or fide cit in the plan may affect the amount of future contributions, the Company will be required to recognise its share of these obligations.
Under the speci c exemptions within IAS 19, the scheme is therefore treated as a fide ned contribution scheme within the Group financial statements.
The total cost charged to the income statement in respect of this scheme was 2,235,000 2009: 2,037,000.
