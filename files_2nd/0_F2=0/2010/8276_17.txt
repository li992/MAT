The Audit Committee has a process to ensure that any non-audit services do not compromise the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and that relevant UK and US professional and regulatory requirements are met.
A number of criteria are applied when deciding whether pre-approval for such services should be given.
These include the nature of the service, the level of fees and the practicality of appointing an alternative provider, having regard to the skills and experience required to supply the service effectively.
Cumulative fees for audit and non-audit services are presented to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis for review.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring adherence to the pre-approval policy.

On reclassification, valuation adjustments of $45m were recognised, comprising $14m of depreciation not charged whilst held for sale and $31m of further write-downs to recoverable amounts, as required by IFRS 5.
Recoverable amounts were assessed by reference to value in use with the expected future cash flows for the North American hotel comprising substantially all of the write-down discounted at a pre-tax rate of 12.5%.

Impairment charges are included within impairment on the face of the Group income statement and all cumulative impairment losses relate to the Americas managed CGU see below.
Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing as follows: Cost Net book value 2010 2009 2010 2009 $m $m $m $m Asia Australasia franchised and managed operations 92 82 92 82 Americas managed operations 141 141 233 223 92 82 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that an impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period or, in absence of up-to-date strategic plans, the financial budget for the next year with an extrapolation of the cash flows for the following four years, using growth rates based on managements past experience and industry growth forecasts.
After the five-year planning period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on perpetual growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
Pre-tax discount rates are used to discount the cash flows based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks specific to the business model and territory of the CGU being tested.
Asia Australasia goodwill At 31 December 2010, the recoverable amount of the CGU has been assessed based on the approved budget for 2011 and strategic plans covering a five-year period, a perpetual growth rate of 3.5% 2009 3.5% and a discount rate of 14.4% 2009 14.2%.
Impairment was not required at either 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009 and management believe that the carrying value of the CGU would only exceed its recoverable amount in the event of highly unlikely changes in the key assumptions.
Americas goodwill Americas managed operations incurred significant operating losses during 2009 as a result of the global economic downturn and, in particular, IHGs funding obligations under certain management contracts with one US hotel owner.
As a consequence, goodwill was tested on a quarterly basis during 2009 using updated five-year projections prepared by management, a perpetual growth rate of 2.7% and a discount rate of 12.5%.
Due to the expectation of continuing losses, the recoverable value of the CGU declined resulting in the impairment of the remaining goodwill balance during 2009.
Total impairment charges of $78m were recognised in 2009 $57m at 30 June 2009 and $21m at 30 September 2009.

Unlisted equity shares are mainly investments in entities that own hotels which the Group manages.
The fair value of unlisted equity shares has been estimated using valuation guidelines issued by the British Venture Capital Association and is based on assumptions regarding expected future earnings.
Listed equity share valuation is based on observable market prices.
Dividend income from available-for-sale equity securities of $8m 2009 $7m is reported as other operating income and expenses in the Group income statement.
Other financial assets consist of trade deposits and restricted cash.
These amounts have been designated as loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost.
Restricted cash of $42m 2009 $47m relates to cash held in bank accounts which is pledged as collateral to insurance companies for risks retained by the Group.

In 2009, a deposit of $26m was also written off directly to the income statement as an exceptional item see note 5 as it is no longer considered recoverable under the terms of the related management contracts which are deemed onerous.
The provision is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount is possible: at that point the amount considered irrecoverable is either written off directly to the income statement or, if previously provided, against the financial asset with no impact on the income statement.

Currency swaps were transacted at the same time the bonds were issued in order to swap the proceeds and interest flows into US dollars see note 23 for further details.
Unsecured bank loans Unsecured bank loans are borrowings under the Groups Syndicated Facility and its short-term bilateral loan and overdraft facilities.
Amounts are classified as non-current when the facilities have more than 12 months to expiry.
These facilities contain financial covenants and, as at the end of the reporting period, the Group was not in breach of these covenants, nor had any breaches or defaults occurred during the year.
At 1 January 2009, the Group had access to a $0.5bn term loan with a 30-month maturity and a $1.6bn five-year revolving credit facility.

The defined benefit section of the plan closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The assets of the plan are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
In addition, there are unfunded UK pension arrangements for certain members affected by the lifetime allowance.
The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded InterContinental Hotels non-qualified pension plans and post-employment benefits schemes.
These plans are now closed to new members.
The Group also operates a number of minor pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.

Assumptions The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the benefit obligation are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US benefits 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 % % % % % % Wages and salaries increases 5.0 5.1 4.0 4.0 Pensions increases 3.5 3.6 Discount rate 5.3 5.7 5.2 5.7 5.2 5.7 Inflation rate 3.5 3.6 Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 9.0 Pre 65 ultimate rate reached in 2021 10.0 Post 65 ultimate rate reached in 2023 14.0 Ultimate rate that the cost trend rate trends to 5.0 5.0 Mortality is the most significant demographic assumption.
The current assumptions for the UK plans are based on the S1NA tables with long cohort projections and a 1% per annum underpin to future mortality improvements with age rated down by 1.75 years for pensioners and 1.5 years for non-pensioners.
In the US, the current assumptions are based on the RP-2000 IRS PPA @ 2011 Non-Annuitant Annuitant healthy tables for males and females.
In both territories, the assumptions have been revised during the year to reflect increased life expectancy at retirement age as follows: Pension plans UK US 2010 2009 2010 2009 Years Years Years Years a Current pensioners at 65 male 24 23 19 18 female 27 26 21 21 b Future pensioners at 65 male 26 24 21 18 female 29 27 22 21 a Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the end of the reporting period.

Retirement benefits continued Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and the statement of financial position.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.

Funding commitments The most recent actuarial valuation of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan was carried out as at 31 March 2009 and showed a deficit of 129m on a funding basis.
Under the recovery plan agreed with the trustees, the Group aims to eliminate this deficit by March 2017 through additional Company contributions of up to 100m and projected investment returns.
The agreed additional contributions comprise three annual payments of 10m: 10m was paid in August 2010 and two further payments of 10m are due on or before 31 July 2011 and 2012, together with further payments related to the disposal of hotels 7.5% of net sales proceeds and growth in the Groups EBITDA above specified targets.
If required in 2017, a top-up payment will be made to bring the total additional contributions up to 100m.
The Plan is formally valued every three years and future valuations could lead to changes in the amounts payable beyond March 2012.
Company contributions are expected to be $35m in 2011, including known UK additional contributions of 14m 2009 10m with further amounts payable if there are any hotel disposals.

The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of $298m and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.

The deferred tax asset of $150m 2009 $146m recognised in respect of losses includes $113m 2009 $97m in respect of capital losses available to be utilised against the realisation of capital gains which are recognised as a deferred tax liability and $37m 2009 $49m in respect of revenue tax losses.
Deferred tax assets of $79m are recognised in relation to legal entities which suffered a tax loss in the current or preceding period.
These assets are recognised based upon future taxable profit forecasts for the entities concerned.
Tax losses with a net tax value of $411m 2009 $517m, including capital losses with a value of $148m 2009 $196m, have not been recognised.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely with the exception of $16m which expires after six years 2009 $1m which expires after 15 years, $1m which expires after nine years and $14m which expires after three years.
Deferred tax assets with a net tax value of $nil 2009 $9m in respect of share-based payments, $15m 2009 $13m in respect of employee benefits and $5m 2009 $7m in respect of other items have not been recognised.
These losses and other deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the Group does not anticipate being able to offset these against future profits or gains in order to realise any economic benefit in the foreseeable future.
However, future benefits may arise depending on future profits arising or on the outcome of EU case law and legislative developments.
At 31 December 2010, the Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with post-acquisition undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Following introduction of a UK dividend exemption regime, the tax which would arise upon reversal of the temporary differences is not expected to exceed $20m.
Other short-term temporary differences relate primarily to provisions and accruals and share-based payments.
