Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 79 1.
General information Drax Group plc the Company is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act.
The Company and its subsidiaries together the Group operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK.
The address of the Companys registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom.
The operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 3 to the Companys separate financial statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
Also, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as set out in the Directors report on page 42, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value.
Management has performed a review of the presentation of certain items in the income statement and balance sheet.
As Drax increases the amounts of biomass burnt at the power station, the value of Renewables Obligation Certificates ROCs in the balance sheet is likely to become more significant.
Accordingly, management has concluded that ROCs should be separately presented in the balance sheet.
33.1 million 2009: 11.7 million has been reclassified from inventories to intangible assets ROCs held for sale.
Additionally, management felt that metering charges, broker fees and ROC costs incurred at Haven Power Limited Haven Power should be separately disclosed under other retail costs within the income statement in order to provide better information to users of the Annual report and accounts, as the retail business continues to grow.
Accordingly 2.9 million of costs included in other operating and administrative expenses and 1.5 million of costs included in fuel costs has been reclassified to other retail costs in the 2009 comparative figures.
These are presentational changes only and have no net impact on operating profit or net assets for either of the financial years disclosed.
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards In 2010, several new, revised and amended standards became effective.
These are IFRS 3 revised Business combinations, IAS 27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements, IAS 28 Investments in associates, IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures, IFRS 2 Share-based payment amendment, IAS 39 revised Financial instruments: recognition and measurement eligible hedged items, IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets fromcustomers and IFRIC 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to owners.
The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
In future periods, IFRS 3 is expected to impact the accounting for business combinations, with any future acquisition costs being expensed in the income statement.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.

The adoption of these standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 80 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
A Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to the reporting date each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
B Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Property, plant and equipment Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on managements reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is therefore subjective.
Impairment The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 3 F. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates see note 9.
Pensions The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet date.
Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, expected returns on scheme assets, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate.
The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries.
However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.
Taxation In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered, taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting income streams.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign exchange rates are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates.
The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
C Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Revenues from sales of ROCs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT.
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party.
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated as giving rise to revenue.
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange is treated as giving rise to revenue.
The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid.
If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid.
Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 81 Revenue from the sale of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power is recorded after deduction of trade discounts, VAT and Climate Change Levy.
Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are likely to be recovered.
Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed is calculated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates.
D Segmental reporting The business activity of the Group consists of the generation and sale of electricity at the Drax Power Station, along with the sale of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power.
The retail segment currently falls below the threshold of separate reportable segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments and as such we only present one operating segment.
E Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the criteria for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
For business combinations made after 1 July 2010, costs directly attributable to the business combination are not included in the measurement of cost, but expensed in the income statement in line with IFRS 3 revised.
F Goodwill Goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually or more frequently where there is an indication it may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to its other assets.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
G Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.
Cost comprises the purchase price after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station.
The estimated useful lives, beginning in 2004 when they were reset, are currently: Years Main generating plant and freehold buildings 35 Other plant and machinery 3-20 Decommissioning asset 35 Plant spare parts 35 Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment.
Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met: namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 82 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued H Impairment of property, plant and equipment At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these assets may have suffered an impairment loss.
If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset value in use or sales value net of expenses.
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount.
The discount rate applied is a pre-tax rate based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.
I Decommissioning costs Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis.
The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within tangible fixed assets and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
J Inventories Inventories primarily comprise coal and biomass stocks, together with other fuels and consumables.
Coal and biomass stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Other stocks of fuel and consumables are valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value.
K Intangible assets ROCs held for sale The Group is able to claim ROCs from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets OFGEM as a result of burning renewable fuels instead of coal.
A market exists for the sale of ROCs and the Group recognises revenue in the income statement at the point where the risks and rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party.
The attributable incremental cost of generating ROCs above that of burning coal, limited to the recoverable amount expected to be realised, is included within current intangible assets in respect of ROCs earned but not yet sold.
L CO emissions allowances 2 The Group recognises its free emissions allowances received under the UK NAP at nil cost allocated to each financial year on a straight line basis.
Any additional allowances purchased in the market are recorded at cost.
The Group also recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances.
The charge to the income statement within fuel costs and the liability is measured based on an estimate of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the net obligation, taking into account generation, free allowances allocated under the UK NAP, market purchases, sales and forward contracts already in place allocated to the financial year, and the market price at the balance sheet date.
M Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, and is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity and is shown in the statement of comprehensive income.
N Pension and other post-retirement benefits The Group provides pensions through an approved industry defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
The current service cost and interest cost of the pension charge are deducted in arriving at operating profit in other operating and administrative expenses.
The excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
For the defined contribution scheme, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due to be paid.
O Share-based payments Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 83 P Foreign currencies The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company and its principal subsidiaries.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement.
Q Financial instruments Debt instruments The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at the fair value of the consideration paid or received.
Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Transaction costs any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
Commodity contracts and treasury derivatives Where possible, the Group takes the own use exemption for commodity contracts entered into and held for the purpose of the Groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements.
Commodity contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption are dealt with as derivatives and are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve to the extent that contracts are treated as effective hedges, or the income statement to the extent the contracts are not treated as effective hedges.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
The Group also uses a number of treasury related derivatives to manage exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations.
Treasury related derivatives are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve to the extent that contracts are considered to be effective cash flow hedges, or the income statement to the extent the contracts are not effective as hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are released in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than 12 months.
Derivatives not designated into an effective hedge relationship are classified as a current asset or current liability.
Other financial instruments Issued equity Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
The share premium account records the difference between the nominal value of shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Short-term investments Short-term investments includes cash held on deposits with financial institutions, with a maturity of greater than three months at inception.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables and payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established subsequently where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term items where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.

Taxation The income tax expense reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Under the Groups previous financing structure, Drax Holdings Limited a subsidiary company was partially funded by a Eurobond payable to another group company.
The whole of the coupon was previously prepaid, and an accounting based tax deduction has been claimed with the corresponding interest charged in the Drax Holdings Limited income statement each year to 31 December 2008.
Were HMRC to successfully challenge the deductions claimed in respect of the Eurobond coupons for open years to 31 December 2008, it is estimated that the additional tax liability would be up to 90 million, together with interest and penalties.
In November December 2008, HMRC issued draft legislation which updated rules on, amongst other things, the tax deductibility of interest and which was generally expected to reduce the tax effectiveness of the Eurobond financing arrangements.
As previously described, the Eurobond was formally waived by the lending group company on 30 December 2008.
As a result, the whole of the remaining prepaid coupon was charged in the Drax Holdings Limited income statement, giving rise to potential additional interest deductions with a tax effect of around 220 million.
Because of the risks related to the unwind of the Eurobond structure, no benefit will be recognised in the Groups financial statements with respect to the potential additional deductions until the Group is more certain they will be realised.
We have continued our dialogue with HMRC over this tax position.
However, whilst we still believe we have a strong and robust case, we are no clearer as to whether we will ultimately be successful.
Changes in the rate of tax On 28 June 2010, the Finance Bill 2010-11 was presented to Parliament.
The Bill proposed four annual reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% by 2014-15.
At the balance sheet date, the reduction in the corporation tax rate to 27% from April 2011 had been enacted.
The resulting net reduction in the deferred tax liability has been reflected in the balance sheet at 31 December 2010 and gave rise to a credit to the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 8 million.
It is currently expected that each future Finance Bill enacted will reduce the corporation tax rate by 1% until the rate of 24% is reached.
Years ended 31 December 2010 2009 m m Tax charge comprises: Current tax 88.5 89.1 Deferred tax: Before impact of corporation tax rate change 14.4 42.2 Impact of corporation tax rate change 7.6 Tax charge 66.5 46.9 Years ended 31 December 2010 2009 m m Tax on items credited charged to equity: Deferred tax on actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme note 20 1.7 4.2 Deferred tax on cash flow hedges note 20 65.1 105.1 Impact of corporation tax rate change on deferred tax on cash flow hedges note 20 0.6 67.4 100.9 The tax differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28% 2009: 28%.

Dividends Years ended 31 December 2010 2009 m m Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year based on the number of shares in issue at the record date : Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 14.1 pence per share paid on 15 October 2010 2009: 4.1 pence per share paid on 7 October 2009 51.5 15.0 Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 9.6 pence per share paid on 14 May 2010 2009: 38.3 pence per share paid on 22 May 2009 35.0 130.0 86.5 145.0 At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 17.9 pence per share equivalent to approximately 65.3 million payable on or before 13 May 2011.
The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2010.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
In calculating diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year is adjusted, when relevant, to take account of outstanding share options in relation to the Groups Approved Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE Plan and contingently issuable shares under the Groups Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP and Bonus Matching Plan BMP.
The underlying earnings per share has been calculated after excluding the after tax impact of marking to market derivative contracts which are not hedged.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below: Years ended 31 December 2010 2009 m m Earnings: Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings 188.4 110.9 After tax impact of unrealised losses on derivative contracts 44.6 93.4 Underlying earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company 233.0 204.3 Years ended 31 December 2010 2009 Number of shares: Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share millions 364.9 352.7 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares under share plans 0.7 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share millions 365.6 352.7 Earnings per share basic and diluted pence 52 31 Underlying earnings per share basic and diluted pence 64 58 9.
Intangible assets goodwill m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2009, 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 10.7 Goodwill arising on the Haven Power acquisition has been allocated to the Haven cash-generating unit Haven Power Limited, or Haven Power.
At 31 December 2010, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value: accordingly a sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed.
Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 87 The recoverable amount of Haven Power was calculated based on a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions used in these calculations are those regarding the discount rates and future cash flows.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.
The first five years of cash flows are based upon the five year Business Plan approved by the Board.
Future cash flows have been taken in perpetuity, assuming no growth rate is applied to the final year of the Business Plan.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from Haven Power is 12% reflecting a reasonable assumption of the applicable cost of capital.
Plant and equipment includes assets held under finance lease agreements with a carrying value at 31 December 2010 of 0.7 million 2009: 0.7 million.

At 31 December 2010, the Group had amounts receivable from three 2009: four significant counterparties, representing 75% 2009: 73% of trade receivables, all of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms.
Counterparty risk is discussed in note 18.
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2010 includes amounts of 307.0 million, 295.6 million and 159.1 million 2009: 222.9 million and 221.8 million derived from three customers 2009: two customers, each representing 10% or more of the Groups revenue for the year.
Management does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk and as a result, does not believe that a further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts of 2.6 million 2009: 1.2 million.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience, and includes 2.6 million in relation to Haven Power 2009: 1.1 million.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table: Years ended 31 December 2010 2009 m m At 1 January 1.2 - Acquisition of subsidiary - 0.1 Receivables written off 1.0 1.2 Provision for receivables impairment 2.4 2.3 At 31 December 2.6 1.2 Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 89 14.

These repayments were made in line with the target repayment profile as a result of the levels of cash available for debt service.
On 3August 2009, the Group completed the refinancing of the term loan facility and the 100 million working capital facility which would otherwise have fallen due for repayment on 31 December 2010.
The maturity date of both facilities has been extended to December 2012 to coincide with the maturity of the 200 million letter of credit facility, which remains in place.
Future scheduled debt repayments are 67.5 million in each of 2011 and 2012, after which point the term loan will have been repaid in full.

Borrowings continued Analysis of borrowings Borrowings at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 consisted principally of bank loans held by the Companys subsidiary Drax Finance Limited as follows: As at 31 December 2010 Borrowings Deferred before deferred finance Net finance costs costs borrowings m m m Term loans 135.0 8.5 126.5 Finance lease liabilities 0.5 0.5 Total borrowings 135.5 8.5 127.0 Less current portion 67.6 5.9 61.7 Non-current borrowings 67.9 2.6 65.3 As at 31 December 2009 Borrowings Deferred before deferred finance Net finance costs costs borrowings m m m Term loans 200.0 10.8 189.2 Finance lease liabilities 0.6 0.6 Total borrowings 200.6 10.8 189.8 Less current portion 65.1 2.2 62.9 Non-current borrowings 135.5 8.6 126.9 Letter of credit facility and revolving credit facility In addition to its borrowings, the Group has access to a letter of credit facility which provides credit support of up to 200 million to the Groups trading activities.
The letter of credit facility, which has a final maturity date in December 2012, provides a mechanism whereby it may be extended for a further 12 months at any time up to one year before the final maturity date.
The Group guarantees the obligations of a number of banks in respect of the letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group.
As at 31 December 2010 the Groups contingent liability in respect of these guarantees amounted to 134.3 million 2009: 141.3 million.
In addition, the Group has access to an undrawn 100 million revolving credit facility agreement, which may be used to issue letters of credit or for working capital, with a final maturity date of December 2012.
Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 91 18.
Financial instruments The Group issues or holds financial instruments for two purposes: financial instruments relating to the financing and management of risks for the Groups operations: and financial instruments relating to the financing and risks in the Groups debt portfolio.
The Groups financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, items that arise directly from its operations and derivative contracts.
The Group enters into short-term and medium-term forward contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of coal and CO2 emissions allowances.
The Group also enters into interest rate swap agreements and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
Fair value Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables generally have short times to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying values approximate their fair value.
The Groups borrowings relate principally to term loans, the carrying amounts of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.
The fair values and maturities of the Groups derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market and recorded in the balance sheet at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 were as follows: As at 31 December 2010 As at 31 December 2009 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Commodity contracts: Less than one year 87.8 167.5 286.1 141.3 More than one year but not more than two years 19.3 0.3 89.4 5.7 More than two years 6.1 0.3 23.1 0.3 Interest rate swaps: Less than one year 4.6 4.4 More than one year but not more than two years 2.1 More than two years 0.8 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts: Less than one year 24.8 25.8 22.7 32.6 More than one year but not more than two years 0.3 0.5 More than two years 0.1 0.4 Total 138.4 199.4 421.3 187.2 Less: non-current portion Commodity contracts 25.4 0.6 112.5 6.0 Interest rate swaps 2.9 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 0.4 0.9 Total non-current portion 25.8 1.5 112.5 8.9 Current portion 112.6 197.9 308.8 178.3 The amounts recorded in the income statement in respect of derivatives which are marked-to-market were as follows: Years ended 31 December 2010 2009 m m Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 60.5 129.7 The unrealised gains and losses recorded in the income statement arise from a proportion of our derivative contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting: largely financial coal and foreign exchange.
Due to the nature of commodity contracts and the way they are managed, the own use exemption has been applied to a limited number of them, including the five and a quarter year baseload contract with Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2007, and the five year baseload contract with Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2010.
Commodity contracts fair value The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 92 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 18.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps fair value The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by discounting the future cash flows using forward interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives fair value The Group has also reviewed all contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives.
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
All financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, have been grouped into Level 2, as defined below, based on the degree to which fair value is observable.
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of commodity contracts and forward foreign exchange currency contracts is determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price: therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by discounting future cash flows using forward interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.
These are also categorised as Level 2 inputs.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
Risk The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the Risk Management Committees as detailed in Corporate governance page 52 which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO emissions allowances.
Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the 2 financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of making forward power sales with corresponding purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so.
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.
The Group purchases coal, biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources.
All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.
All physical biomass purchase contracts are currently entered into and held for the purpose of the Groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements and are therefore designated as own use.
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and international sources.
All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.
Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance sheet date.
The analysis is based on the Groups commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If commodity prices had been 5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 would decrease increase by 17.3 million 2009: decrease increase by 16.1 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to financial coal derivatives: and Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 93 other equity reserves would decrease increase by 9.3 million 2009: decrease increase by 30.3 million mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its outstanding bank debt.
In particular, it is exposed to changes in the LIBOR interest rate of sterling denominated debt, as all of its debt is both denominated in sterling and has a variable LIBOR rate.
The Group mitigates this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities.
Information about the Groups instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included in note 17.
Following the refinancing of the term loan in 2009, new interest rate swaps were taken out which do not meet the required hedge criteria and hence movements in the fair value of the new swaps are recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of the previous swaps was frozen on refinancing and has been unwound over the period to December 2010.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit after tax and net assets for the year ended 31 December 2010 would increase decrease by 0.2 million 2009: profit after tax would decrease increase by 0.8 million, other equity reserves would increase decrease by 1.2 million mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge substantially all of the Groups fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars, biomass purchases in Canadian and US dollars and euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in euros.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising foreign currency exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger weaker against other currencies, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 would increase decrease by 6.1 million 2009: increase decrease by 1.1 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts for the purposes of meeting commitments under financial coal contracts: and other equity reserves would decrease increase by 0.9 million 2009: net assets would increase decrease by 1.1 million as a result of the changes in the fair value of hedged foreign currency exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, long-term debt and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

The Group purchases a significant portion of its coal requirement under contracts with a number of UK suppliers.
There is a risk that if a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and or fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing coal from other suppliers.
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.
The Group is also exposed to the risk of collateral calls against its trading contracts should the Groups creditworthiness deteriorate and its counterparties demand collateral to protect their exposure to the Group.
In order to mitigate this risk the Group has undertaken a number of actions refining its trading strategy to concentrate on more credit-efficient structures and to transact more fixed margin contracts which are less exposed to commodity price movements: and increasing the volume of business traded through its supply company, Haven Power, which is less exposed to collateral calls.
In addition, the Group entered into a trading agreement with Barclays Bank PLC on 5 May 2010, which enables it to enter into trading contracts without the requirement to post collateral up to a fixed amount of 135 million, irrespective of the Groups underlying credit rating.
Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 95 Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below: As at 31 December 2010 2009 m m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 236.0 80.4 Short-term investments 95.0 55.0 Trade and other receivables 235.6 210.1 Derivative financial instruments 138.4 421.3 705.0 766.8 Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of 2.6 million 2009: 1.2 million.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by a management committee.
Counterparties without an investment grade rating are normally required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral.
Where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies.
These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.
Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity excluding the hedge reserve, together with net debt or, when the Group has net cash, shareholders equity excluding the hedge reserve less net cash.
Net debt cash comprises borrowings disclosed in note 17, cash and cash equivalents in note 15 and short-term investments in note 14.
Equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company comprises issued capital, capital reserves and accumulated losses, excluding the hedge reserve, see Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Maintaining an optimal supporting capital structure is one of the Groups key priorities, and as such, our performance is detailed on page 16 of the Business review.
The capital structure of the Group is as follows: As at 31 December 2010 2009 m m Borrowings 127.0 189.8 Cash and cash equivalents 236.0 80.4 Short-term investments 95.0 55.0 Net cash debt 204.0 54.4 Total shareholders equity, excluding hedge reserve 898.5 798.3 19.
Provisions Reinstatement m At 1 January 2009 2.6 Additional provision 2.8 Unwinding of discount 0.5 At 1 January 2010 5.9 Unwinding of discount 0.5 At 31 December 2010 6.4 The provision for reinstatement represents the estimated decommissioning, demolition and site remediation costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, on a discounted basis.
An amount equivalent to the initial provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is being depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs note 5.
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices.
The discount rate applied is the pre-tax rate based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.

The placing raised 105.5 million and was undertaken to help maintain the Groups investment grade debt rating, with the proceeds used to pay down debt on 31 July 2009.
16 The placing shares were credited as fully paid and rank equally in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 11 29 pence each in the capital of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of such shares after the date of issue of the placing shares.
Financials Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 97 The share placing was achieved through a cash box placing arrangement.
The benefit of a cash box placing arrangement is that it is legally structured to enable the merger relief criteria within the Companies Act to apply.
Accordingly the funds raised in excess of the nominal value of the shares issued have been treated as distributable within retained reserves rather than credited to the share premium account.
As a consequence, of the 105.5 million funds raised, share capital increased by 2.9 million, and the balance of 102.6 million reduced the Groups accumulated losses in the year ended 31 December 2009.
Issued under employee share schemes 16 On 1 September 2010, a total of 6,098 ordinary shares of 11 pence each in the Company were issued in satisfaction of shares 29 vesting in accordance with the rules of the Groups Bonus Matching Plan to six individuals whose employment with the Group had terminated due to retirement.
There were no such issues in 2009.
The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares, carrying no right to fixed income.
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme on behalf of the Drax Power Group DPG of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS.
This scheme was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS.
The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit scheme As at the year end, the most recent actuarial valuation of the DPG ESPS was 31 March 2007.
This has been updated as at 31 December 2010 to reflect relevant changes in assumptions.
The principal assumptions were as follows: As at 31 December 2010 2009 % p. a.
Discount rate 5.3 5.7 Inflation 3.5 3.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.3 3.4 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.5 5.1 Expected return on plan assets 5.9 6.1 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member who retired in 2010 at age 60 will live on average for a further 26 years 2009: 25 years after retirement if they are male, and for a further 28 years 2009: 27 years after retirement if they are female.
Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 years and 29 years respectively 2009: 27 years and 28 years respectively.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: As at 31 December 2010 2009 m m Defined benefit obligation 167.2 146.5 Fair value of plan assets 129.9 113.4 Net liability recognised in the balance sheet 37.3 33.1 The amounts recognised in the income statement, entirely within other operating and administrative expenses, are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2010 2009 m m Current service cost 4.3 3.3 Interest cost 8.4 7.0 Expected return on plan assets 7.1 5.2 Total included in staff costs note 28 5.6 5.1 The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 10.5 million 2009: gain of 13.2 million.

The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets were as follows: As at 31 December 2010 2009 % % Equities 40.5 40.2 Fixed interest bonds 42.4 39.8 Hedge funds 13.0 14.5 Cash 4.1 5.5 The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme.
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption, which is determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds, allowing for the duration of the schemes liabilities.
Recent volatility in financial markets has caused the range of yields on corporate bonds to widen significantly.
It is estimated that an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would have the effect of decreasing the net liability recognised in the balance sheet by approximately 15 million 2009: 14 million and a decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would increase the net liability recognised in the balance sheet by 17 million 2009: 16 million.
