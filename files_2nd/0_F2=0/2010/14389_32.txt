This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
The following items have been excluded from the headline measure: exceptional items, including income and expenditure relating to John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation: amortisation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amortisation charge is a non-cash item, and the directors believe that it should be added back to give a clearer picture of underlying performance: and other financing gains and losses, which represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments which do not fall to be hedge accounted under IAS 39.
The excluded items are referred to as non-headline items.

This cost has been reduced by a partial reversal of the impairment loss recognised in 2009.
The total costs are expected to amount to approximately 45m.
The UK defined benefit pension schemes were closed with effect from 31 October 2009 and the curtailment gain of 3.6m arising has been reflected in the income statement.
There was also a net gain of 0.3m due to the closure of a small US scheme.
The profit on disposal of businesses includes 3.8m in respect of additional consideration relating to the Groups disposal of its automotive seals manufacturing business to Cyclam Holdings LLC on 31 July 2007.
This consideration was contingent on the acquirer successfully restructuring the business.
Property disposals include 5.5m arising from the grant of planning permission in respect of a property sold in the previous year.
Costs of acquisition comprise costs directly attributable to the work undertaken during the year to investigate and complete acquisitions.
The operating charge of 17.6m in respect of John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation comprises 8.1m in respect of increased provision for adverse legal judgments, 5.2m arising from movements in the discounting due to changes in US interest rates and 4.3m in respect of legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers and defence strategy.
Year ended 31 July 2009 On 3 June 2008 the Company announced a number of changes to its corporate centre and divisional organisation.
The total cost of this restructuring, including redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, was considered exceptional by virtue of its size.
In the year ended 31 July 2009 23.7m was charged in respect of this restructuring, including an impairment charge of 3.1m in respect of affected properties.
The Group closed the US defined benefit pension plan with effect from 30 April 2009, and recognised a curtailment gain of 19.4m.
In addition the cost of post-retirement healthcare provision in both the UK and US was reduced by requiring greater beneficiary contributions, generating a past service benefit of 50.9m.
The operating charge of 15.2m in respect of John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation comprised 10.6m in respect of increased provision for adverse legal judgments, 2.5m arising from movements in the discounting due to changes in US interest rates and 2.1m in respect of legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers.

No additional tax liabilities have been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the timing of other temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the future.
Other deferred tax also includes the tax benefits of losses carried forward amounting to 31.9m 2009: 31.3m.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of 92.4m 2009: 78.3m and pensions and other long term liabilities of 194.5m 2009: 240.6m due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.

These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2010.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2010 2009 UK US Other UK US Other Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 3.0% 3.8% n a 3.1% Rate of increase for active deferred members 4.1% n a n a n a n a n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.2% n a 1.4% 3.3% n a 1.4% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.2% n a 0.6% 3.3% n a 0.6% Discount rate 5.4% 5.2% 5.2% 5.9% 6.0% 5.9% Inflation rate 3.2% n a 1.8% 3.3% n a 1.7% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% n a 3.0% 5.0% n a 3.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA these are disclosed as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the SAPS All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on recent actual mortality experience of members within each.
They allow for future improvements in life expectancy in line with 80% and 60% of the long cohort for males and females respectively with an annual 1% underpin.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the most recent mortality study table produced for retired pensioners in the US RP 2000 table.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue collar versus white collar.
The assumptions give the following: Expected further years of life UK US Male Female Male Female Member who retires next year at age 65 22 24 19 21 Member, currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time 24 25 19 21 The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2010 were: 2010 UK schemes US schemes Other countries Total Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 8.2% 1,361.2 8.8% 222.7 9.4% 16.1 1,600.0 Government bonds 4.2% 268.9 3.8% 91.5 5.8% 8.1 368.5 Corporate bonds 5.4% 272.7 5.2% 58.5 3.7% 0.9 332.1 Insured liabilities 5.4% 488.0 5.2% 2.0 490.0 Property 7.2% 155.9 3.7% 0.4 156.3 Other 4.6% 69.6 3.0% 11.9 4.0% 14.7 96.2 Total market value 2,616.3 386.6 40.2 3,043.1 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 2,658.0 543.4 57.1 3,258.5 Deficit 41.7 156.8 16.9 215.4 Unfunded pension plans 37.3 6.1 22.6 66.0 Post-retirement healthcare 8.0 14.4 0.8 23.2 Present value of unfunded obligations 45.3 20.5 23.4 89.2 Unrecognised asset due to surplus restriction 0.7 0.7 Net pension liability 87.0 177.3 41.0 305.3 Post-retirement assets 80.3 80.3 Post-retirement liabilities 167.3 177.3 41.0 385.6 Net pension liability 87.0 177.3 41.0 305.3 105 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2010 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Operating and financial review Strategy Overview smi ar10 back aw:Layout 1 12 10 10 10:34 Page 106 Notes to the accounts continued 10 Post-retirement benefits continued 2009 UK schemes US schemes Other countries Total Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 8.2% 1,113.1 8.8% 198.6 9.3% 7.8 1,319.5 Government bonds 4.5% 242.5 4.3% 68.5 4.6% 3.5 314.5 Corporate bonds 5.9% 267.1 6.0% 44.2 7.7% 2.5 313.8 Insured liabilities 5.9% 490.1 6.0% 1.8 n a 491.9 Property 7.2% 137.8 n a 2.9% 0.2 138.0 Other 5.0% 163.1 3.0% 21.4 5.0% 12.9 197.4 Total market value 2,413.7 334.5 26.9 2,775.1 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 2,531.8 462.6 33.2 3,027.6 Deficit 118.1 128.1 6.3 252.5 Unfunded pension plans 36.0 4.9 18.7 59.6 Post-retirement healthcare 6.2 18.0 0.7 24.9 Present value of unfunded obligations 42.2 22.9 19.4 84.5 Unrecognised asset due to surplus restriction 2.0 2.0 Net pension liability 160.3 151.0 27.7 339.0 Post-retirement assets 39.2 39.2 Post-retirement liabilities 199.5 151.0 27.7 378.2 Net pension liability 160.3 151.0 27.7 339.0 Other assets in the UK and US comprise cash and current assets.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.

Following completion of the triennial actuarial valuation of the principal UK defined benefit schemes SIPS and TIGPS as at 31 March 2009 and 5 April 2009, the Group agreed 10 year funding plans which require the following contributions: Cash contributions to SIPS of 36m a year for 10 years.
An initial investment of 25m in index-linked gilts which will be held in an escrow account with further ongoing monthly investments of 2m for nine years commencing in July 2011.
The escrow account remains an asset of the Group see note 15 until 2020.
At that time the assets in escrow are allocated subject to the funding position of SIPS.
In addition, the escrow account may revert to the Group, should there be a surplus at an intervening triennial review.
A conditional cash contribution to the TIGPS of up to 50m is payable in May 2012, with further biannual payments of 8m thereafter.
These payments may not be made, or paid only in part, subject to the funding position of the Scheme in the six months ending 5 April 2012.
In addition to the funding plans referred to above, the Group agreed to make cash contributions in respect of any future service cost based on actuarial advice.
In 2011 payments to the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are expected to total approximately 65m.

Sensitivity Valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 July 2010 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.

Related party transactions The Group has a service contract with a company connected to a member of the Executive Committee.
Costs of 0.2m 2009: 0.2m were incurred in respect of this arrangement.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held within each cash generating unit CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash-flows of the CGU, applying a discount rate based on the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted where appropriate for risks specific to the CGU.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash-flows.
These forecast cash-flows are based on approved budgets and represent a best estimate of future performance.
The assumptions used in the discounted cash-flow forecasts incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets.
The assumptions used in the impairment testing of significant CGUs are as follows: Smiths Medical Critical Care Smiths Detection Civil 2010 2009 2010 2009 Net book value of goodwill m 398.3 374.3 311.5 316.0 Discount rate 8.0% 8.0% 8.5% 8.0% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Growth rates 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% Other key assumptions future sales prices and volumes operating margins cost structure and productivity The first five years of the cash-flow forecasts are based on our annual planning and strategic planning processes.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond this period do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the underlying markets and do not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment planning.
Sales projections are made with reference to specific customer relationships and product lines.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the Smiths Medical Critical Care and Smiths Detection Civil CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
The balance of the goodwill represents smaller individual amounts which have been allocated to specific operating companies and smaller CGUs.
These amounts are tested for impairment at this level.
Sensitivity analysis was also performed for these CGUs, and no reasonable changes in the key assumptions would have caused an impairment.

Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board.
The policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 17. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.
It excludes loans and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.

Based on the assets and liabilities held at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, the change in the fair value of financial instruments not designated as net investment hedges would have the following effect: Gain loss Gain loss Impact on profit recognised in Impact on profit recognised in for the year reserves for the year reserves 31 July 2010 31 July 2010 31 July 2009 31 July 2009 m m m m US dollar 1.5 1.8 4.9 5.0 Euro 1.0 2.9 0.2 1.2 Sterling 1.3 1.8 1.8 5.1 These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax and exclude the effect of quasi-equity intra-group loans.
116 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2010 smi ar10 back aw:Layout 1 12 10 10 10:34 Page 117 21 Financial risk management continued Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2010 contracts with a nominal value of 292.7m 2009: 310.7m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 152.1m 2009: 121.7m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 22.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the income statement in the same period that the cash-flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising as a result of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 99.6% are for periods of 12 months or less 2009: 99%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2010 31 July 2009 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of year 1.8 1.1 Exchange adjustments 0.2 0.3 Gains and losses on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 2.3 8.0 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement revenue 0.1 9.6 cost of sales 0.9 2.8 administrative expenses 1.3 1.6 Carried forward cash-ow hedge reserve at end of year 0.6 1.8 Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
Net investment hedges The table below sets out the currency of loans and swap contracts designated as net investment hedges: At 31 July 2010 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 587.0 248.1 835.1 Currency swap contracts 206.7 32.4 39.2 135.1 206.7 619.4 287.3 135.1 835.1 At 31 July 2009 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 551.3 36.9 588.2 Cross-currency swap contracts 59.9 59.9 Currency swap contracts 380.8 92.6 207.4 80.8 380.8 584.0 267.3 117.7 588.2 At 31 July 2010 swap contracts hedged the Groups exposure to Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi 2009: Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
At 31 July 2009 currency loans in other currencies hedged the Groups exposure to Canadian dollars and Australian dollars.
Of the contracts designated as net investment hedges, 56% 2009: 53% are current and the balance matures over the next three years 2009: four years.
The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2010 31 July 2009 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of year 88.9 30.3 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 39.3 58.6 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of year 128.2 88.9 117 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2010 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Operating and financial review Strategy Overview smi ar10 back aw:Layout 1 12 10 10 10:34 Page 118 Notes to the accounts continued 21 Financial risk management continued The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, it would have the following effect: Loss Loss recognised in recognised in hedge reserve hedge reserve 31 July 2010 31 July 2009 m m US dollar 61.8 70.8 Euro 26.0 10.7 These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 60% to 100% of the level of net debt.
This is achieved primarily through fixed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2010 91.5% 2009: 73.9% of the Groups net borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2010, after interest rate swaps, is 5.4% 2009: 5.8%.

These positions hedge the risk of variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 22.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 195.3m 2009: 149.7m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and foreign exchange rates at 31 July 2010, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have a 0.2m 2009: 2.2m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
118 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2010 smi ar10 back aw:Layout 1 12 10 10 10:34 Page 119 21 Financial risk management continued c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables and derivatives, totals 199.9m at 31 July 2010 2009: 99.5m.

These exposures were with the same bank, which has a AA credit rating.
d Liquidity risk Borrowing facilities The Board policy specifies the maintenance of unused committed credit facilities of at least 200m at all times to ensure it has sufficient available funds for operations and planned development.
The principal 660m revolving credit facility matures in June 2012.
At the balance sheet date the Group had the following undrawn credit facilities: 2010 2009 m m Expiring within one year Expiring between one and two years 660.0 Expiring after two years 622.8 660.0 622.8 Cash deposits As at 31 July 2010, 36.6m 2009: 7.7m of cash and cash equivalents was on deposit with various banks of which 20.8m 2009: 5.9m was on deposit in the UK.

Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of individual businesses.
Reorganisation On 3 June 2008 the Company announced a number of changes to its corporate centre and divisional headquarters.
The total cost of this restructuring, including redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, is expected to amount to approximately 45m over the period to 2010, of which 5.4m has been charged in the current year.
Reorganisation provisions include 2.8m 2009: 4.8m costs relating to restructuring supply arrangements following the automotive seals disposal.
These costs are expected to be spread over the next six years.
Disposal The disposal provision relates to warranties and other obligations in respect of the disposal of the Marine Systems and Aerospace businesses.
Most of the balance is expected to be utilised within the next five years.
Litigation John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
An adverse judgment at first instance from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois is currently under appeal.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has begun to meet defence costs directly.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
No account has been taken of recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are not yet sufficiently certain to permit recognition as an asset for these purposes.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
JCI is actively monitoring the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist all asbestos claims based upon this defence.
Approximately 184,000 claims against JCI have been dismissed before trial over the last 31 years.
JCI is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 116,000 claims.
Despite the large number of claims brought against JCI, it has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in only 100 cases over the period, and has had to pay awards amounting to approximately US$95m.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs and, whilst the number of claims being filed against JCI and other defendants has been declining, the proportion of mesothelioma claims has increased, and JCIs ability to defend these cases is likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.

Projections used range between 10 and 17 years.
The future trend of legal costs, allowing for 3% cost inflation.
The rate of future claims filed.
The rate of successful resolution of claims.
The average amount of judgments awarded.
The provision is based on past history and allows for decreasing costs based on published tables of asbestos incidence projections.
However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The provision in respect of JCI is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.

Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
Apart from that relating to JCI, none of the other provisions is discounted.

As stated in note 23, John Crane, Inc. JCI is involved in numerous law suits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos fibres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of JCI, the products were safe.
Provision has been made for the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
The Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by this provision: however, because of the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of litigation beyond this period, the cost of adverse judgments cannot be reliably estimated.
Other contingent liabilities and commitments In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to litigation such as product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions.
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as mass tort and class action litigation, and legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents.
These types of proceedings or the threat of them are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes.
Any claim brought against the Group with or without merit, could be costly to defend.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgment but there can be no guarantee that these provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.
At 31 July 2010, contingent liabilities, comprising bonds and guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounted to 143.5m 2009: 202.1m, including pension commitments of 40.6m 2009: 116.1m.
At 31 July 2009 the Parent Company had two letters of credit to support the Groups pension plans, one for 100.0m and one for 50.0m, which were both partially utilised.
Following the agreement of ten year funding plans with the Trustees of its two major UK pension schemes the first letter of credit has been cancelled, leaving only the 50.0m facility.
The Group is currently co-operating with the relevant authorities in investigating certain business conduct issues.
Based on the work completed to date, these are not expected to give rise to any material financial exposure.

IDI designs and produces highly engineered, application specific connectors using a proprietary spring probe contact technology.
It focuses on mission critical applications for semiconductor and circuit-board testing, and high reliability connectors for military, medical, homeland security and industrial markets.
The IDI acquisition expands the Smiths Interconnect product range and provides a significant Chinese base for the Connectors technology group.
From the date of acquisition to 31 July 2010, the acquisitions contributed 20.3m to revenue, 2.8m to headline profit before taxation and 0.9 m to profit before taxation.
If Smiths had acquired the businesses at the beginning of the financial period, the acquisitions would have contributed 52.1m to revenue and 7.2m to headline profit before tax.
The intangible assets recognised comprise 22.8m in respect of technology and 28.7m in respect of customer relationships and orders.
Goodwill represents the value of synergies arising from the acquisitions and future growth opportunities.
The goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Smiths Group Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP was introduced in 2004 and replaced the 95 ESOS for executive directors and senior executives.
Conditional awards of up to 1.5 times salary and exceptionally three times salary were granted annually.
The awards are released following the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent the PSPs performance tests have been met.
One-third of the award is subject to a total shareholder return TSR target relative to other FTSE 100 companies excluding financial companies and investment trusts.
For full vesting, the companys TSR must be at or above the 75th percentile over the three year performance period.
25% of the award will vest if the companys TSR is at median.
Awards will vest on a straightline pro-rata basis between median and 75th percentile.
The remaining two-thirds of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS growth target measured before exceptional items.
Full vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 12% per annum.
25% vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 5% per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between 5% and 12%.
The PSP has been replaced by the VSP, and the final award under the PSP will be released in December 2010.
Value Sharing Plan VSP The VSP is a long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders in July 2008 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels over three-year and four-year periods commencing with the financial year 2008 09.
Corporate participants will be rewarded under the VSP for value creation at a Group level, whereas the executives with divisional responsibilities will be rewarded for value creation within the division for which they are responsible.
For the Group scheme, one-third of the award will depend on the growth in Smiths TSR over and above the median for the companies comprising the FTSE 100  companies and the remainingtwo-thirds of each awardwill be determined by the growth in internal value in excess of 9.5% a year.
The growth in internal value is calculated as follows: adjusted profit before tax PBT times  toshareholders.
Thedivisional awards will depend on meeting an internal value growth target set for the division in which the participant works.
The participants in the VSP will not be eligible for awards under the Performance Share Plan in 2008 09 or 2009 10.
Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP, as introduced in October 2005, the executive directors and senior executives are able, if invited, to use their after tax bonus or 25% of their basic salary after tax, whichever is the greater, to invest in the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur and the matching shares will be released at the end of the three year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed ROCE over the Performance Period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the Performance Period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
In July 2008 the CIP was amended.
From 2009 participants have been required to invest 50% of their post tax bonus in purchased shares.
The performance conditions have been expanded to include an enhanced performance condition of ROCE exceeding WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum.
If the enhanced performance condition is met, two matching shares will be issued for every purchased share.
The average closing share price over the financial year was 1,000.61p 2009: 832.08p.
There has been no change to the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period.

The key assumptions used in the models for 2010 and 2009 are volatility of 30% 2009: 23% and dividend yield of 3.75% 2009: 3.75%.
Assumptions on expected volatility and expected option term have been made on the basis of historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
These generated a weighted average fair value for CIP of 18.89 2009: 6.96 and VSP PSP of 11.21 2009: 11.01.
Included within staff costs is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 11.3m 2009: 8.0m, of which 10.3m 2009: 9.4m relates to equity-settled share-based payment.
At 31 July 2010 the creditor relating to cash-settled schemes is 0.9m 2009: 0.2m.
