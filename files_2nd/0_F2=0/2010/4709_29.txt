Intangible assets continued Capitalised brands are regarded as having indefi nite useful economic lives and have therefore not been amortised.
These brands are protected by trademarks, which are renewable indefi nitely, in all of the major markets where they are sold.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives of these brands.
The nature of the premium drinks industry is that obsolescence is not a common issue, with indefi nite brand lives being commonplace, and Diageo has a number of brands that were Financial statements originally created more than 100 years ago.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having 105 indefi nite lives for accounting purposes.
Auditors report in respect of the Group b For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill has been attributed to cash-generating units as follows: 106 2010 2009 Consolidated million million income statement North America United States 224 192 107 Europe Ireland 46 43 Consolidated Southern Europe 66 69 statement of comprehensive Russia and Eastern Europe 42 42 income Other cash-generating units 22 17 108 400 363 Consolidated balance sheet 109 Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions of businesses and distribution rights and includes synergies arising from cost savings and the Consolidated opportunity to utilise the groups distribution network to leverage marketing of the acquired products.
statement of In the year ended 30 June 2008, the non-controlling interest recognised on the acquisition of the distribution rights for Ketel One changes in equity vodka products excluded the non-controlling partys share of the deferred tax liability relating to the intangible asset representing the 110 distribution rights.
This omission was corrected in the year ended 30 June 2009, and the eff ect of the adjustment was to reduce Consolidated statement of goodwill attributed to the United States by 58 million and reduce non-controlling interests by the same amount.
cash fl ows 111 c Other intangibles comprise principally distribution rights.
In the year ended 30 June 2008, Diageo acquired the global distribution Accounting policies rights for Ketel One vodka products in perpetuity, and the directors believe that it is appropriate to treat these rights as having an of the group indefi nite life for accounting purposes.
The carrying value at 30 June 2010 was 1,200 million 2009 1,091 million.
All other distribution 115 rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the distribution arrangements, generally between 10 and 20 years, unless Notes to the consolidated there is an indication that the asset may be impaired, in which case, if necessary, the asset is written down or the amortisation period is fi financial statements reassessed and changed.
Amortisation of other intangible assets is recognised in other operating expenses in the income statement.
161 Auditors report in d Computer software includes 65 million 2009 25 million in respect of projects in the course of development.
Amortisation of respect of the company computer software is recognised in other operating expenses in the income statement.
162 Company balance sheet Impairment testing To ensure that brands, goodwill and other intangibles with indefi nite useful lives are not carried at above their 163 recoverable amount, impairment reviews are performed comparing the net carrying value with the recoverable amount using value Accounting policies in use calculations.
For goodwill the recoverable amount is calculated in respect of the cash-generating unit including the attributed of the company goodwill.
These calculations are performed annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 164 may not be recoverable.
The value in use calculations are based on discounted forecast cash fl ows and terminal values calculated on Notes to the company the assumption that cash fl ows continue in perpetuity at the long term growth rate of each country or region.
fi financial statements Cash fl ows are forecast for each brand, other intangible and cash-generating unit for the next fi financial year in the groups annual 167 Principal group fi financial plan, which is approved by the board and refl ects managements expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, companies based on past experience and external sources of information.
The discount rates used are calculated as the groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriated adjustment where necessary to refl ect the groups assessment of the specifi c risks relating to the relevant market or region.
The long term growth rates applied at the end of the forecast period are taken as the real gross domestic product GDP growth rate of the country or region plus its infl ation rate, based on a fi five-year average adjusted to take into account expectations specifi c to the group.
For goodwill, these assumptions are based on the cash-generating unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated.
For brands, they are based on a weighted average taking into account the country or countries where sales are generated.
For the Ketel One vodka distribution rights, a discount rate of 10% and a long term growth rate of 3.4% have been used.
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth, driven by Diageos sales, marketing and distribution expertise, which is in excess of the long term growth rates for the applicable countries or regions.
In these circumstances, the cash fl ow forecast is extended beyond the next fi financial year by up to eight years using a detailed plan.
For the Ketel One vodka distribution rights, a six-year plan has been used, as an eight-year plan was agreed with the Nolet Group on the date of the acquisition 9 June 2008, and principally refl ects the benefi ts forecast to arise when Ketel One vodka is launched in a number of countries throughout the world during that longer period.

Taxation This section provides a descriptive summary of certain US federal income tax and UK tax consequences that are likely to be material to the holders of the ordinary shares or ADSs, who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes.
It does not purport to be a complete technical analysis or a listing of all potential tax eff ects relevant to the ownership of the ordinary shares and ADSs.
This section does not apply to any holder who is subject to special rules, including: a dealer in securities or foreign currency: a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings: a tax-exempt organisation: a life insurance company: a person liable for alternative minimum tax: a person that actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the voting stock of Diageo: a person that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction: a US holder as defi ned below whose functional currency is not the US dollar: or a partnership or a partner in a partnership that holds ordinary shares or ADSs.
For UK tax purposes, this section applies only to persons who are the absolute benefi cial owners of their shares or ADSs and who hold their shares or ADSs as investments.
It assumes that holders of ADSs will be treated as holders of the underlying ordinary shares.
In addition to those persons mentioned above, this section does not apply to holders that are banks, regulated investment companies, other fi financial institutions or to persons who have or are deemed to have acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs in the course of an employment or trade.
This summary does not apply to persons who are treated as non-domiciled and resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for the purposes of UK tax law.
This section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings and court decisions, the laws of the United Kingdom and the practice of Her Majestys Revenue and Customs, all as currently in eff ect, as well as on the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Tax on Income and Capital Gains the Treaty.
These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.
