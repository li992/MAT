2 Carried interest plans In recognition of Mr Queens increased focus on infrastructure investment on his appointment in 2007 as Managing Partner, Infrastructure, his level of participation in the Global Growth 2006-08 carried interest plan was cut by half, from 0.68% to 0.34% of investments.
It was decided that he would instead receive an exceptional payment, part of which was deferred over the three years from 2007 08 to 2009 10.
The third payment as part of this arrangement, in respect of 2009 10, is set out in note 3 to the table on page 83.
3 Combined carried interest and co-investment plans Following his appointment as Chief Executive in January 2009, Mr Queen forfeited a proportion of his interests in the Global Growth 08-10 and India Infrastructure 07-10 plans.
4 General Accrued values of plan interests are calculated on the basis set out in note 5 on page 100.
Accrued values can increase and decrease with investment valuations and other factors and will not necessarily lead to an actual payment to the participant.
Audit The tables in this report including the notes thereto on pages 83 to 88 have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP.
