29. shaRe-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 53 weeks ended 3 October 2010, including national insurance of 0.9m 2009: 0.5m and dividend equivalents of 0.7m 2009: 0.3m, is 9.4m 2009: 7.
All of that expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
the britvic share incentive plan sip The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3% of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 75 per four week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the period are shown in the table below.
The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.

The option price is the average market price of Britvic plcs shares on the three business days before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% per annum in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2009: 25% of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an option holder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was 81.6p 2009: 52.3p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

the britvic performance share plan psp The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares or nil cost options to be made to selected employees subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
Different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
Awards up to and including 2008 were made in respect of ordinary shares.
Awards granted in 2009 were made in respect of nil cost options.
Nil cost options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance conditions and remain exercisable until 10 years 7 years after the date of grant for employees based in the UK Ireland respectively.
The total number of awards granted to members of the senior leadership team during the current period is divided equally between the total shareholder return TSR and return on invested capital ROIC performance conditions described below.
Prior to 2008, all of the awards granted to this group were subject to the TSR condition.
Awards granted to members of the senior leadership team are subject to a performance condition which measures the companys TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group consisting of 22 companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the companys position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 25% 2009: 25% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
Awards granted to members of the senior leadership team are subject to a performance condition which requires the companys ROIC to be at least 23.2% 2009: 18.8% over the three year performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 21.9% 2009: 16.8% over the performance period, 25% 2009: 25% of the award will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the percentage of awards that vest and no awards will vest if ROIC is below the lower threshold.
Awards granted to members of the senior management team are subject to a performance condition which requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the awards to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% pa in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2009: 25% of the awards will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of awards that vest and no awards will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In addition, a transitional award was made to members of both the senior leadership team and the senior management team shortly after flotation, at levels varying according to seniority.
These awards will vest in tranches over a period of up to three years, subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
The performance condition requires the companys ROIC to be at least 17% over the performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 15% over the performance period, 50% of the award will vest.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.
