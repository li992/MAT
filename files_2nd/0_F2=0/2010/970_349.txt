Value in use is based on the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU or reportable segment in its current state.
Fair value less costs to sell is normally supported by market observable data in the case of listed subsidiaries, market share price at 31 December of the respective entity or discounted cash flow models taking account of assumptions that would be made by market participants.
