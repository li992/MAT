Overview KPIs Strategy Operations and Finance Responsibility Governance Financial Statements Company Information Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and Interpretations IFRICs The following new and revised IFRSs have been adopted in these consolidated financial statements.
The application of these new and revised IFRSs has not had any material impact on the amounts reported for the current and prior years but may affect the accounting for future transactions or arrangements.
Other new standards and interpretations have no significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions.
The amendments clarify the scope of IFRS 2, as well as the accounting for group cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the separate or individual financial statements ofanentity receiving the goods or services when another group entity or shareholder has the obligation to settle the award.
IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations requires some significant changes to the way business combinations are accounted for.
All costs associated with business combinations are expensed directly to the Income Statement.
Additionally any changes to contingent consideration classified as debt must now be dealt with through the Income Statement subsequent to acquisition.
Improvements to IFRSs: in April 2009 the International Accounting Standards Board issued its second omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
The adoption of these amendments, which are effective from 1 January 2010, did not have any impact on the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group.
The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs and IFRICs that are EU endorsed but are not yet effective: IAS 24 revised in 2009 Related Party Disclosures.
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
Amendments to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues.
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments.
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010.
The Group is currently considering the implications of these standards and interpretations.
They are not expected to have a material impact onthe Groups financial statements.
2 Accounting policies Statement of compliance Both the consolidated Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS including International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business Review on pages 6 to 27.
The financial position ofthe Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described onpages 12 to 22 of the Business Review.
Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in note 20 to the financial statements.
Inaddition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial riskmanagement objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements ofthe Group and the Company and compared it to the level of long term debt, committed bank facilities and cash resources over the medium term.
The assessment included a review of thefinancial forecasts and the preparation of sensitivity analysis on the key factors which could affect future cash flow and funding requirements.
The Groups policy on funding capacity is to ensure that we always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak working capital requirements.
At31December 2010 the Group had cash and deposits of 126.8m, 205.3mof loan notes and 322.3m of undrawn committed bank facilities available to meet future funding requirements.
At 31 December 2010, the net debt position of the Group was 49.6m note 26 including 205.3m of debt arranged under loan notes, ofwhich 48.5m falls due to be repaid before the publication of the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2011.
Having undertaken this review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to fund its operations forthe foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue toadopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries up to 31 December each year.
Theresults of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year, are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Financial Statements Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 51 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The subsidiarys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity at the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is capitalised as an asset.
Goodwill allocated to the strategic land holdings is recognised as an asset, being the intrinsic value within these holdings in the acquired entities, which is realised upon satisfactory planning permission being obtained and sale of theland.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date by performing a value in use calculation, using a discount factor based on the pre-tax rate implicit in current market transactions of similar assets, covering the expected period of realisation and considering current market conditions.
It is tested by reference to the proportion oflegally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining acquired strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions and comparing the carrying value of the assets with their recoverable amounts.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSshas been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment.
The allocation of this goodwill for impairment testing is disclosed in note 14.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit orloss on disposal.
Brand intangibles Internally generated brands are not held on the balance sheet.
TheGroup carries assets on the balance sheet only for brands that have been acquired.
Acquired brand values are calculated based ondiscounted cash flows.
No amortisation is charged on brand intangibles, as the Group believes that the value of the brands is maintained indefinitely.
The factors that result in the durability of the brands capitalised is that there are no material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of these intangibles.
The acquired brands are tested annually for impairment by performing a value in use calculation, using a discount factor based on the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital, on the branded incremental income stream.
Where a brands life is not deemed to be indefinite it is written off over its expected useful life on a straight-line basis.
Revenue recognition Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion.
The sales proceeds of part exchange properties are included as a reduction in cost of sales.
Government grants Grants are included within work in progress in the balance sheet andare credited to the statement of comprehensive income over thelife of the developments to which they relate.
Grants related to income are deducted from the related expense in the statement ofcomprehensive income.
Other operating income Other operating income comprises profits from the sale of land holdings, freehold reversions, rent receivable, and other incidental sundry income.
Operating expenses Operating expenses represent the administration costs of the business, which are written off to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Borrowing costs Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value being proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Finance charges, including direct issue costs are accounted for and taken to the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where bank agreements include a legal right of offset for in hand andoverdraft balances, and the Group intends to settle net the outstanding position, the offset arrangements are applied to record the net position in the balance sheet.
52 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 Financial Statements Overview KPIs Strategy Operations and Finance Responsibility Governance Financial Statements Company Information Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Exceptional items Exceptional items comprise items of income and expense that are material in amount and unlikely to recur and which merit separate disclosure in order to provide an understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
Examples of events giving rise to the disclosure of income and expense as exceptional items include, but are not limited to, reorganisation of operations and economic events which necessitate a review of asset valuations.
Share-based payment Charges for employee services received in exchange for share-based payment have been made for all options awards in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, to spread the fair value of the grant over the vesting period.
The fair value of such options has been calculated using the Binomial Option Pricing Model, based upon publicly available market data at the point of grant.
Share options include both market and non-market conditions.
Market conditions are considered in the establishment of the initial valuation of the options.
In the event of failure to meet market conditions share-based payment charges are not reversed.
In the event of failure to meet non-market conditions share-based payment charges are reversed.
Share-based payments are charged wholly in the ultimate Parent Company, which makes internal recharges to subsidiaries for these services as appropriate.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes.
It also operates a defined contribution scheme for employees who are not members of a defined benefit scheme.
The liability in respect of the defined benefit schemes is thepresent value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheetdate, less the fair value of the schemes assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains and losses.
Further details of the schemes and the valuation methods applied may be found in note29.
Expected scheme gains and losses are recognised via operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income and actuarial gains and losses via the statement of other comprehensive income.
Subsidiary entities bear a charge for current employees based upontheir current pensionable salaries.
Differences between this charge and the current service cost are borne by the ultimate ParentCompany as the legal sponsor, as are all experience gains andlosses.
Payments to the defined contribution scheme are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Once the payments have been made, the Group has no further payment obligations.
Taxation Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates, and adjusted for any tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting or taxable profit, and differences relating to investment in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using the prevailing tax rates.
Where the deferred tax asset recognised in respect of share-based payments would give rise to a credit in excess of the related accounting charge at the prevailing tax rate the excess is recognised directly in equity.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset canbe utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Leases as lessee Amounts payable under operating leases are charged to work in progress or operating expenses on a straight line accruals basis over the lease term.
Financial Statements Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 53 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment It is the Groups policy to hold property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation, subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided using the straight line method to write off the cost less any estimated residual value, over the estimated useful lives on the following bases: Plant 3 to 5 years.
Fixtures and fittings 3 to 5 years.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Investments Interests in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less impairment.
Other investments are stated at fair value.
Jointly controlled entities A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest with one or more other parties where a contractual arrangement has established joint control over the entity.
Investments in jointly controlled entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Available for sale financial assets Receivables on extended terms granted as part of a sales transaction are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property, and are stated at fair value as described in note 17.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the other comprehensive income section of the statement of comprehensive income, with the exceptions of impairment losses, changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method, which are recognised within profit for the year.
Where the asset is disposed of, or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the income statement for the period.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Land with planning includes undeveloped land and land under development and is initially recorded at discounted cost.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, the carrying value differs from the amount that will ultimately be paid in setting the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of settlement.
Work in progress comprises direct materials, labour costs, site overheads, associated professional charges and other attributable overheads.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling prices less all estimated costs of completion and overheads.
Investments in land without the benefit of a planning consent are initially included at cost.
Regular reviews are carried out to identify any impairment in the value of the land considering the existing use value of the land and the likelihood of achieving a planning consent and the value thereof.
Provision is made to reflect any irrecoverable amounts.
Expenditure relating to forward land, including options and fees, is held at cost.
If the option expires or the Directors no longer consider it likely that the option will be exercised prior to the securing of planning permission, the amount is written off on that date.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables on normal terms do not carry any interest, are stated at amortised cost and are assessed for recoverability on anongoing basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses currency swaps and interest rate swaps to manage financial risk.
Interest charges are stated after taking account of these swaps.
Certain financial liabilities are held in foreign currencies, which are translated at prevailing exchange rates.
The Group has also entered into cross currency hedges to mitigate exposure to both foreign currency and interest rates on these loans.
Cash flow hedging instruments are held at fair value in the balance sheet.
The effective portion of gains and losses on these instruments are taken to the hedge reserve until realised.
On realisation such gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value hedging instruments are held at fair value in the balance sheet with gains and losses recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
These are offset against gains and losses onthe hedged item insofar as the hedges are effective.
54 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 Financial Statements Overview KPIs Strategy Operations and Finance Responsibility Governance Financial Statements Company Information Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, theCompany considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats theguarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Trade and other payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land purchases, are initially recorded at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Deposits New property deposits and on account contract receipts are held within current trade and other payables until the legal completion of the related property or cancellation of the sale.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances in the bank accounts with no notice or less than three months notice from inception, and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Interest bearing borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are carried at amortised cost unless hedged using fair value hedges.
Those interest bearing borrowings hedged using fair value hedges are carried at amortised cost adjusted for the fair value of hedged risks determined with reference to discounted risk-adjusted expected future cash flows and application of current foreign market exchange rates.
Dividends Dividends receivable from subsidiaries are accounted for on a cashbasis, or once formally approved by the shareholders of the subsidiarycompanies.
Dividends payable are recorded in the period in which they are approved or paid, whichever is earliest.
Own shares held The Group may acquire holdings in its own shares either directly orviaemployee benefit trusts.
The acquisition cost of such shares including associated purchase costs is treated as a deduction fromretained earnings.
Such shares may be used in satisfaction of employee options or rights, in which case the cost of such shares is reversed from the profit reserves on a first in first out basis.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the Groups accounting policies which are described in note 2, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have asignificant impact upon the financial statements, excepting those involving estimation which are dealt with below.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet dateare: Land and work in progress Valuations which include an estimation of costs to complete and remaining revenues are carried out at regular intervals throughout the year, during which site development costs are allocated between units built in the current year and those to be built in future years.
These assessments include a degree of inherent uncertainty when estimating the profitability of a site and in assessing any impairment provisions which may be required.
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group conducted a review of inventories in the light of the challenging UK housing market.
This resulted in a net reversal of previous write downs of inventory carrying values of 74.8m.
During the year ended 31December 2010, the Group conducted further reviews of the net realisable value of its inventory carrying values which resulted in a further net reversal of theprevious write downs of inventories of 80.2m.
The reviews were conducted on a site by site basis, using valuations that incorporated selling price and development cost movements, based onlocal management and the Boardsassessment of market conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
Ifthere are significant movements in UK house prices or development costs beyond managements expectations then further impairments reversals of previous write downs of land and work in progress may be necessary.
Goodwill The impairment testing of goodwill is substantially dependent upon the ability of the Group to successfully progress its strategic land holdings.
The assumptions on which this estimate is based may beundermined by any significant changes in the current planning regime, or adverse economic conditions in the United Kingdom.
Thecarrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 195.0mwith an impairment of 4.6m recognised during the year.
Financial Statements Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 55 Notes to the financial statements continued 3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Brand intangibles The intangible brand assets have been assessed against the discounted cash flows arising.
These are based upon estimated returns from the related businesses, which may be impacted by various factors, most notably Government social housing policy andfurther deterioration in the economic conditions in the United Kingdom.
The carrying amount of indefinite life brands at the balance sheet date was 60.0m, with no impairment recognised during the year ended 31 December 2010.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets principally comprise loans granted aspart of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legalcharge on the respective property.
Impairment allowances are determined on a portfolio basis which takes into account factors such as the length of time that the loan has been outstanding, market conditions, including those in respect of house price inflation, forced sale discount and probability of borrower default.
The variables used are kept under regular review to ensure that as far as possible they reflect current economic circumstances: however changes in interest rates, unemployment levels and bankruptcy trends in the UK, could result in actual losses differing from reported impairment allowances.
At 31 December 2010 the asset recognised on the balance sheet was 115.2m 2009: 68.0m.
Pensions The Directors have employed the services of a qualified, independent actuary in assessing pension liabilities.
However, they recognise that final liabilities and asset returns may differ from actuarial estimates and therefore the ultimate pension liability may differ from that included in the financial statements.
Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, which is dependent upon management assessment of future trading activity and is therefore subject to a degree of inherent uncertainty.
The carrying amount of investments in the Companys balance sheet is 3,198.7m 2009: 3,252.0m.
4 Principal activities The Groups operating segments, which are North, Central and South Divisions have similar economic characteristics, products, construction processes and types of customers, and meet the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8 in full.
Consequently, the Group has aggregated its geographic operations into one reportable segment which is housebuilding in the United Kingdom.
5 Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Revenue as noted in the statement of comprehensive income: Sale of goods 1,569.5 1,420.6 Other operating income 10.9 8.8 Finance income 13.4 4.8 Total revenue 1,593.8 1,434.2 Sale of goods includes 114.9m 2009: 71.0m of revenue generated where the sale has been achieved using part exchange incentives.
Proceeds received on the disposal of part exchange properties, which are not included in revenue, were 87.2m 2009: 114.3m.
56 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 Financial Statements Overview KPIs Strategy Operations and Finance Responsibility Governance Financial Statements Company Information Notes to the financial statements continued 6 Exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income and expenditure that, in the judgement of management, should be disclosed separately on the basisthat they are material, either by their nature or their size, to an understanding of the financial performance and significantly distort the comparability of financial performance between accounting periods.
Items of income or expense that are considered by management fordesignation as exceptional include such items as significant restructuring, write-downs of current assets and impairments of non-currentassets.
Impairment of inventories During the year, the Group reviewed the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying-values of its sites.
This resulted in a net reversal of the previous write-down of inventories of 80.2m 2009: 74.8m.
Further details are provided in note 18.
Amended financing arrangements In the context of the Groups strong liquidity and cash generation, management have continued to review the value and cost of credit facilities available to the Group in line with the Groups existing treasury management policies.
Given prevailing low market returns on the Groups significant cash deposits, management have taken action to optimise its debt portfolio.
On 21 June 2010 the Group used cash balances to prepay, with an applicable make-whole amount, US Senior Loan Notes due 16 April 2013 with a face value of $160m.
The prepayment resulted in an exceptional charge to the statement of comprehensive income of 14.5m, including 1.2m write-off of unamortised fees.
At the same time, associated hedging contracts, including a cross currency interest rate swap with a principal amount of $160m, were cancelled resulting in an exceptional gain of 7.4m recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The total net cash payment in relation to the prepayment and cancellation of associated hedging controls was 109.3m, including 1.1m of accelerated interest payments charged to underlying profit.
On 16 July 2010 the Group used cash balances to prepay, with an applicable make-whole amount, US Senior Loan Notes due 9 November 2010 with a face value of $104m.
The prepayment resulted in an exceptional charge to the statement of comprehensive income of 0.3m, including 0.2m write-off of unamortised fees.
At the same time, associated hedging contracts, including a cross currency interest rate swap with a principal amount of $104m, were cancelled resulting in an exceptional charge of 1.6m recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The total net cash payment in relation to the prepayment and cancellation of associated hedging contracts was 75.2m, including 1.4m ofaccelerated interest payments charged to underlying profit.
On 24 November 2010, a 322m Forward Start Revolving Credit Facility from the Groups existing lenders became available for drawing.
Thisfacility is available until 31 March 2012.
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and during the period when the facility is available the Group shows no significant use of the facility.
Accordingly, of the remaining balance of unamortised costs, 8.2m has been written off as an exceptional charge in the statement of comprehensive income.
7 Key management remuneration Key management personnel, as disclosed under IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures, have been identified as the Board of Directors and other senior operational management.
Detailed disclosures of individual remuneration, pension entitlements and share options, for those Directors who served during the year, are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 43.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start of the year, giving a figure of 302.9m 2009: 302.0m Underlying earnings per share excludes exceptional items and goodwill impairment.

37.0m 2009: 37.0m of this amount represented the brand value of Charles Church, acquired with Beazer Group plc in 2001.
Acquired brand values, including the brand value of Charles Church which is classified as goodwill as this was acquired before the date oftransition to IFRSs, are calculated based on discounted cash flows and are tested annually for impairment.
The remainder of goodwill isallocated to acquired strategic land holdings and is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
Growth rates incorporate volume, selling price and direct cost changes.
Financial Statements Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 61 Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Intangible assets continued The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolated for fouryears, to form the basis of the Groups five year business plan.
When performing the impairment review of the brands, the relevant retraction growth rates included therein vary between 1% to 14% 2009: 2% to 12%, reflecting the current state of the UK housing market.
The retraction growth rates in relation to the impairment review of goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings vary between 1% to 4% 2009:5% to 4%.
After this period the growth rates applied to calculate the cash flow forecasts vary between nil and 3% 2009: nil and 4% reflecting managements estimate of the forecast recovery in the UK housing market, which do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the industry.
Management used pre-tax discount factors between 6% and 9% 2009: 8.0% and 10.0% over the forecast periods.
The goodwill allocated to acquired strategic land holdings is further tested by reference to the proportion of legally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions.
This review resulted in an underlying impairment of 3.9m 2009: 4.0m.
The effect of testing goodwill for impairment in the manner set out is that the goodwill will be completely impaired once the final plot that management expects to receive a satisfactory planning permission, is sold.
On concluding the annual impairment testing, there remains 120.0m 2009: 123.1m and 36.6m 2009: 37.3m of Beazer and Westbury goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings and 37.0m 2009: 37.0m allocated to the Charles Church brand.
In addition, there is 60.0m 2009: 60.0m of carrying value in relation to the Westbury brand.
The remaining 1.4m 2009: 2.2m represents goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs.
Acquired know how is amortised over its estimated useful life, which is 10 years from the date of its inception.
No reasonable possible change in any of the assumptions noted above would lead to an impairment charge being required.
However, in the event of deterioration in the UK housing market conditions, operating margins reducing, or appropriate discount rates increasing the possibility of impairment losses in the future remains.

The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated future amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the Directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The Directors revisit the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each financial reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited over the estimated deferred term to finance income, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
Credit risk, which the Directors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied.
The Directors review the financial assets for impairment at each balance sheet date.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 December 2010 2009: nil.
None of the financial assets are past their due dates 2009: nil and the Directors expect an average maturity profile of between 5 and 10 years from the balance sheet date.

It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this issubject to a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
Financial Statements Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 65 Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Inventories continued As set out in note 6, the Group conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress portfolio during 2010.
Theimpact of these reviews on the net realisable value of inventories is a net exceptional credit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of80.2m 2009: 74.8m.
An impairment of land and work in progress of 47.6m was recognised in the year 2009: 209.3m and a reversal of 127.8m 2009: 284.1m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period.
These charges reversal arose due to forecast selling prices and development costs on individual sites being higher or lower than previously estimated by management as a result of changing conditions, and or development plans.
Our approach to our net realisable value review has been consistent with that conducted at 31 December 2009.
The key judgements in estimating the future net present realisable value of a site was the estimation of likely sales prices, house types and costs to complete the developments.
Sales prices and costs to complete were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon existing market conditions.
If the UK housing market were to improve or deteriorate in the future then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following the 2010 review, 433.1m 2009: 752.3m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
Land with a carrying value of 312.4m 2009: 304.8m was used as security for land payables note 21.
The value of inventories expensed in 2010 and included in cost of sales was 1,322.2m excluding an exceptional impairment reversal of 80.2m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period 2009: 1,248.9m, excluding the 74.8m exceptional impairmentreversal.

The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
Land payables are reduced for imputed interest, which is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the credit period of the purchase contract.
22 Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Liquidity risk Capital risk Credit risk This note presents basic information regarding the Groups exposure to these risks and the Groups objectives, strategy and processes for measuring and managing exposure to them.
Unless otherwise stated references to Group should be considered to apply to the Company as well.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk management of the Group.
The Board has established the Risk Committee which has the delegated task of overseeing the Boards responsibility with respect to risk and internal control.
The Risk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Risk Committee is supported in this task by the Group Risk management function.
The Group Risk function performs an annual assessment of the risks faced by the Group.
This assessment is used to drive a risk focused programme of work aimed to improve business processes and increase internal control effectiveness.
Market risk Market risk represents the potential for changes in foreign exchange prices and interest rates to affect the Groups profit and the value of its financial instruments.
It also incorporates the effect of the overall UK housing market on the Group.
The Groups objective in market risk management is to minimise its exposures to fluctuations within such variables whilst optimising returns.
The Group has entered into a number of hedge derivative arrangements to limit its exposure to these risks, particularly exchange risk.
TheGroup enters into such transactions only as part of periodic wider refinancing undertakings to take advantage of the mature private placement markets in other countries notably the USA and only with the approval of the Board of Directors.
The Group applies hedge accounting to these arrangements in order to minimise income statement volatility.
68 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 Financial Statements Overview KPIs Strategy Operations and Finance Responsibility Governance Financial Statements Company Information Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Financial risk management continued Currency risk The Groups currency risk principally resides in senior loan notes issued in US dollars and Euros to institutional investors.
The Group has entered into hedge arrangements for all such loan notes swapping them into Sterling on issue.
These hedges match the contractual maturity ofall principal payments and also match foreign currency contractual interest payment maturities, swapping these to either fixed Sterling payments designated cash flow hedges or Sterling payments linked to UK LIBOR designated fair value hedges.
All loan notes hedged to fixed Sterling payments were repaid, along with the related hedge during the year.
In this manner the Groups foreign currency senior loan note cash flows are effectively hedged to mirror those of either a fixed or floating rate Sterling denominated loan.
The Group also has investments in a number of Portuguese jointly controlled entities.
These interests are not hedged.
These investments are considered to be long term in nature.
The Group has no other significant currency exposures.
The following exchange rates applied during the year: 2010 2009 Average Year end Average Year end rate spot rate rate spot rate US Dollar 1.546 1.566 1.567 1.615 Euro 1.166 1.167 1.123 1.126 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows: 2010 2009 USD Euro USD Euro $m m $m m Investments 3.0 3.0 Senior loan notes 216.0 5.0 555.0 5.0 Forward exchange contracts 216.0 5.0 555.0 5.0 Net exposure 3.0 3.0 Sensitivity analysis The hedging arrangements in place over borrowings are such that the Groups profit will be unaffected by any reasonably expected variation in US dollar sterling exchange rate at the reporting date 2009: nil.
A rise fall in the Euro Sterling exchange rate of 10% would result in a 0.3m loss gain in relation to investments 2009: 0.3m.
Interest rate risk The Group holds a mixture of both fixed and floating interest borrowings to control its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group has no formal target for a ratio of fixed to floating funding.
The responsibility for setting the level of fixed rate debt lies with the Board of Directors and is continually reviewed in the light of economic data provided by a variety of sources.
Fixed rate borrowings are achieved by issuance of fixed rate GBP denominated senior loan notes and by interest rate swaps entered into aspart of the hedging arrangements put in place for foreign currency denominated senior loan notes detailed under currency risk above.
Thelatter hedging arrangements were all terminated during the year.
The relative fixed floating balance of net debt, after consideration of hedging arrangements, is as follows: Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Fixed rate 50.8 127.8 50.6 51.7 Floating rate 1.3 122.9 17.5 18.7 Net debt 49.5 250.7 68.1 33.0 Sensitivity analysis If in the year ended 31 December 2010 UK interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower then the Groups pre-tax profit would have decreased increased by 0.5m 2009: 2.2m.
The Groups post-tax profit would have decreased increased by 0.4m 2009: 1.6m.
These sensitivities have been prepared in respect of the direct impact of such an interest rate change on the financing expense of financial instruments only, and do not attempt to estimate the indirect effect such a change may have on wider economic environment such as house pricing, mortgage availability and exchange rates.
Financial Statements Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 69 Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Financial risk management continued Housing market risk The Group is fundamentally affected by the level of UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate such risks on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance its investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
The Group has taken steps to control its speculative build, land acquisition activities and work in progress levels so as to manage the exposure of the Group to any further market disruption.
Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2010, if UK house prices had been 5% higher lower, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial instruments, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would increase decrease in value, excluding any effects of current or deferred tax, by 5.8m 2009: 3.4m.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups strategy to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due.
This is true not only of normal market conditions but also of negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Groups reputation, which would in turn reduce the Groups ability to borrow at optimal rates.
Therefore the Group remains confident of its continued compliance with financial covenants under both syndicated loan and private placement arrangements even in the event of further deterioration in market conditions.
The Group has entered into a number of deferred payment guarantees and performance bonds in the normal course of operations.
Theliabilities to which these guarantees relate are recognised and accounted for in accordance with our standard accounting policies.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on i a daily basis to ensure that utilisation of current facilities is optimised: ii a monthly basis to ensure that covenant compliance targets and medium term liquidity is maintained and iii a long term projection basis for the purpose of identifying long term strategic funding requirements.
In light of the low gearing and strong cash generation of the Group the Directors have, following detailed review of liquidity projections, elected to repay $264m note 6 and 3m of Senior Loan Notes in advance of their due date with applicable make-whole amounts.
Related hedge instruments were also terminated at the same date.
The Group retains committed facilities sufficient to meet its projected liquidity requirements following this repayment.
The Directors also continually assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
They consider the security of capital funding against the potentially higher rates of return offered by debt financing in order to set an efficient but stable balance appropriate to the size oftheGroup.
The Group operates short term uncommitted overdraft facilities to meet day to day liquidity requirements.
These facilities are cancellable onrequest from the bank: however the Group generally maintains low levels of borrowing on these in favour of more cost efficient facilities.
These overdraft facilities are provided by five leading clearing banks to minimise exposure to any one lender.
The Group has a syndicated revolving credit facility committed to March 2012, at a rate linked to LIBOR.
Undrawn committed facilities at the reporting date amount to 322.3m 2009: 600.0m.
Cash deposits The Group has a policy of ensuring cash deposits are made with the primary objective of security of principal.
Accordingly deposits are made only with approved, respected, high credit rating financial institutions.
Deposits are spread across such institutions to minimise exposure to any single entity and are made on a short term basis only to preserve liquidity.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt borrowings as detailed in notes 20 and 26 offset by cash and bank balances and equity of the Group comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in the statement of changes in shareholders equity.
The Groups objective in managing capital is primarily to ensure the continued ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst alsomaintaining an appropriate balance of equity and borrowings and minimising costs of capital.
Close control of deployment of capital is maintained by detailed management review procedures for authorisation of significant capital commitments, such as land acquisition, capital targets for local management and a system of internal interest recharges, ensuring capital cost impact is understood and considered by all management tiers.
Decisions regarding the balance of equity and borrowings, dividend policy and all major borrowing facilities are reserved for the Board.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments not discounted.

In the majority of cases the full cash receipt for each sale occurs on legal completion, which is also the point of revenue recognition under the Groups accounting policies.
In certain specific circumstances the Group has entered into shared equity arrangements not applicable to the Company.
The pressures of recent market conditions necessitated an increase in this form of sales structure from 2008.
In such cases the long term debt is secured upon the property concerned.
The Group does not recognise collateral rights as a separate asset, nor does it have rights to trade such collateral.
Reductions in property values leads to an increase in the credit risk of the Group in respect of such sales.
There was no requirement for a charge for credit impairment in the year 2009: nil.

Where no such price is readily available then fair value is determined by discounting net forward cash flows for the residual period of the contract by a risk adjusted rate.
In the case of available for sale assets there exists an element of uncertainty over the precise final timing and value of receipts which cannot be fully assessed from observable market data.
Available for sale assets consist ofasubstantial number of low value individual assets and have therefore, due to practical constraints, been valued based on market indices and not individual valuations.
Hedge accounting Persimmon currently hedge only foreign currency denominated private placement loan notes.
All hedging instruments are in the form of forward currency swap agreements, and the entirety of the Groups forward currency swap agreements are designated hedges.
The fair value of hedging instruments is an asset of 27.5m 2009: 11.3m.
As foreign currency loan notes all bear fixed interest rates it has been possible to exactly match the foreign currency cash flow requirements with these forward currency swaps, resulting in a very high level of effectiveness.
These swaps hedge all foreign currency cash flows: both principal and interest.
The swap agreements in respect of certain US private placement loan notes, and all EU private placement loan notes, hedge the fixed foreign currency interest cash flows to sterling cash flows linked to UK LIBOR.
These swaps, taken in conjunction with the hedged loan note, therefore have the effect of mirroring a UK LIBOR linked loan arrangement.
These swaps are designated fair value hedges and hedge foreign currency risk.
Further swap agreements existed during the period in respect of certain US private placement loan notes hedge the fixed foreign currency cash flows to fixed sterling cash flows.
These swaps, taken in conjunction with the hedged loan note therefore have the effect mirroring a UK fixed rate loan arrangement.
These swaps are designated cash flow hedges and hedge both foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
All such fixed interest rate swaps and the related private placement loan notes were settled during the year.
The resulting balance of fixed and floating net debt after application of these hedges is disclosed under liquidity risk above.
The periods when the balances relating to cash flow hedges will affect profit are as follows: Group 2010 2009 m m Less than 1 year 0.6 Carrying value 0.6 There was no hedge ineffectiveness during the period.

Motor vehicles leases have an average term of 2.2 years to expiry 2009: 1.0 year.
Property leases have an average term of 6.6 years to expiry 2009: 7.9 years.
29 Retirement benefit obligations At 31 December 2010 the Group operated three employee pension schemes, a stakeholder scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as other comprehensive expense through the statement of comprehensive income.

Persimmon Group Stakeholder Scheme The Persimmon Group Stakeholder Scheme is a defined contribution scheme available to new salaried employees.
The Group matches employees own contributions to their individual Stakeholder plans up to 9% of basic salary, depending on the length of service.
Group contributions to this scheme of 0.9m 2009: 0.9m are expensed through the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme The Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Persimmon Scheme is a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members in 2001.
The assets of the Persimmon Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
An actuarial valuation of the Persimmon Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2008 by a professionally qualified actuary and adopted the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost, as a percentage of Persimmon Scheme members pensionable pay, will increase as the active members approach retirement.
Standard 2000 mortality tables applying a medium cohort effect with an underpin of 1.25% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females were used as a basis to calculate the future liability.
On 1 July 2010 the Persimmon Scheme accrual for active members changed from final salary to career average revalued earnings.
An actuarial valuation at 1 January 2011 is currently underway.
Prowting Pension Scheme On the acquisition of Westbury plc in 2006 the Group assumed control of the Prowting Pension Scheme the Prowting Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.
The assets of the Prowting Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation of the Prowting Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009 by a professionally qualified actuary and adopted the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost, as a percentage of Prowting Scheme members pensionable pay, will increase as the active members approach retirement.
Standard 2000 mortality tables, applying a medium cohort effect with an underpin of 1.25% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females were used as a basis to calculate the future liability.

Financial Statements Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2010 79 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Retirement benefit obligations continued Inflationary growth assumptions In July 2010 the UK Government announced its intention to pass legislation amending the statutory revaluation of pension scheme benefits and increases to pensions in payment under defined benefit pension schemes from RPI to CPI measures.
After reviewing UITF Abstract 48 the Directors have considered whether any reduction in pension liabilities has arisen at the balance sheet date as a result of the ministerial announcement.
This change will affect the Persimmon Scheme and the Prowting Scheme by reducing the deficit in the schemes and therefore the net liability recognised in the balance sheet.
The Groups current obligations to active members within the pension schemes is to revalue CARE benefits at RPI with a cap of 2.5%.
TheGroups obligations in respect of deferred members and pensioners are complex, given the merger of multiple schemes with differing member rights into the Persimmon Scheme, following various acquisitions.
The Directors estimate that the pension deficit would be reduced by circa 5m post tax at 31 December 2010 in relation to those deferred members where there is no RPI obligation when calculating the deferred member pension liability revaluation.
This actuarial gain has not been credited to other comprehensive income in the year as the Directors believe that all pension obligations require detailed review in light of the finalised legislation.
The Directors have continued to apply prudent inflationary assumptions in relation to benefit increases.
The assets of both defined benefit schemes have been calculated at fair value and the liabilities, at each balance sheet date, have been calculated based on the following financial assumptions figures presented are an aggregation of both defined benefit schemes : 2010 2009 % p. a.
Discount rate 5.40 5.60 General pay increases 3.50 3.60 Inflation assumption 3.50 3.60 Pension increases Limited Price Indexation 3.30 3.40 Expected return on Scheme assets: Equities 8.00 8.25 Bonds 4.75 5.00 Property 7.75 8.00 Cash 4.25 4.50 Persimmon Plc employs a building block approach in identifying the long term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
Theassumed long term rate of return on each asset class is set out above.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme at 31 December 2010.
The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of the total fair value of scheme assets are as follows: 2010 2009 % % Equities 62 65 Bonds 33 32 Property Other 5 3 The amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Current service cost 3.2 3.2 Curtailment credit 0.9 Interest cost 21.3 19.3 Expected return on scheme assets 18.4 13.8 Total included in staff costs 5.2 8.7 Actuarial gain loss recognised in other comprehensive income 2.5 29.0 Total defined benefit scheme loss recognised 2.7 37.7 The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is a weighted average of the individual expected rates of return on each asset class.
