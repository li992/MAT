Proved reserves estimates are attributed to future development projects only where there is a significant commitment to project funding and execution, and for which applicable governmental and regulatory approvals have been secured or are reasonably certain to be secured.
Furthermore, estimates of proved reserves only include volumes for which access to market is assured with reasonable certainty.
