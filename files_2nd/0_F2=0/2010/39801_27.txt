At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year 111.9 162.5 18.3 1.0 financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : Effect of foreign exchange rate changes 0.4 26.5 IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 44.6 111.9 7.3 18.3 Cash and cash equivalents per balance sheet 19 44.6 112.7 7.3 18.3 IAS 24 amended, Related Party Disclosures: Bank overdrafts 0.8 IAS 32 amended, Classification of Rights Issues: Cash and cash equivalents per cash flow 44.6 111.9 7.3 18.3 IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments: IFRIC 14 amended, Repayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement: and Improvements to IFRSs May 2010.
IFRS 9 is expected to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement applicable from 1 January 2013, subject to EU adoption.
IFRS 9 in issue at the date of this report concerns classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
It is expected that, during 2011, new requirements for the derecognition of financial instruments, impairment and hedge accounting will be added and we will assess the impact of the new standard when it is finalised.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of other standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost.
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The blended sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 10 per cent change in Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 31.8 million 2009: 62.1 million, with a sensitivity of 30.6 million against rates matching maturities of the contracts.
the euro 2009: 61.3 million and 1.2 million against the US dollar 2009: 0.8 million.
Interest rate swaps and currency swap contracts are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted For the Company, the blended sensitivity is 21.4 million 2009: 2.9 million with a sensitivity of 19.6 million against the euro based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and the appropriate exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
2009: 0.1 million and 1.8 million against the US dollar 2009: 2.8 million.

Unlisted investments, such as those classified as available-for-sale investments, are typically valued by the Some of the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts held by the Group are designated as net investment hedges of Fund Manager based on the amount at which the asset would be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length euro and US dollar denominated subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the income statement transaction.
The methodology used to estimate fair value will depend on the nature and facts and circumstances of the investment but use when the operation is sold.
The remaining forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts are effectively economic cash flow hedges, one of the following bases: transaction value, earnings multiple, net assets, price of recent investment and sale price, where appropriate using the surplus cash in one currency to fund paying off debt in another currency.
These have not been designated as hedges and as a marketability discount will be applied.
a consequence their change in fair value is taken through the income statement.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Company to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
The following table details the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts outstanding as at the year end: The face value of these borrowings is already included in the Group balance sheet.

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management Company personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and The interest rate swaps settle on either a three month or six month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR or sterling LIBOR the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle or receive the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Credit risk management The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.

Derivative financial instruments are transacted via ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by having a policy that requires adequate cash and committed bank facilities remain available to cover and match all debt maturities, committed development spend, trade related and corporate cash flows forward over a rolling 18 month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
