The Group is required to estimate the income tax due in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of differing accounting and tax treatments.
These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
recognition of deferred tax assets, and hence credits to the income statement, is based on forecast future taxable income and therefore involves the exercise of managements judgement regarding the future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which the deferred tax assets are recognised.
The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and tax rules as a consequence of its geographic spread.
It is also subject to tax audits which, by their nature, are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
The total accrual for income tax in any year requires the exercise of management judgement in respect of the interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of challenge of uncertain tax positions and their subsequent settlement.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions for uncertain tax positions.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
as amounts set aside in any year could differ from actual tax liabilities, adjustments may be required in subsequent years which may have a material impact on the Groups income statement and or cash tax payments.
payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items with tax authorities and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this are given on page 28.

In addition, a deferred tax credit of 46 million has been recorded directly in other comprehensive income in relation to the availability of future tax deductions for post-employment contributions in the US and UK.
The recognition of these assets has been based on management projections which indicate the availability of taxable profits to absorb the deductions in future years.
In territories where there is more uncertainty regarding the availability of a sufficient level of future taxable profits, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in full.

It is anticipated that future profitability arising from restructuring and other actions will result in their realisation.
