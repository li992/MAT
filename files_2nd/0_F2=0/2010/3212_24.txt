com report2010 3 Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 Chief Executives Review Energy industry overview In last years Annual Report I highlighted Energy for the the need for Centrica to pursue growth opportunities and lead the drive to the low carbon world.
This has been the focus of our activities in 2010.
Whilst climate change, security of energy demands of today, supply and the affordability of energy supply are issues that impact all countries, the UK has a number of particular issues.
Our past reliance on low cost North Sea and for the future gas is being replaced by an increasing dependence on imports.
While a few years ago we were self-sufficient, this winter we imported 50% of our gas.
In power generation many of the UKs coal fired stations will have to be closed in the next five years to comply with our EU and International Climate Change commitments and our existing nuclear fleet is ageing.
Taken together it is estimated that the UK requires some 200 billion of investment in energy infrastructure to meet the challenges In 2010 we delivered a of climate change and energy security.
This is a huge task and the majority of this strong operational and investment will be in offshore wind, new financial result, reflecting nuclear, additional gas fired generation and grid reinforcement to support intermittent the contribution from wind generation.
the enlarged upstream Investment on this scale will require the policy and regulatory framework to ensure business in the UK, that carbon is correctly priced, that all forms together with a good of low carbon generation are rewarded and that energy diversity is encouraged.
We downstream performance welcome the UK Governments intent to address these issues through the proposed in both the UK and North reform of the electricity market.
Our investment Decarbonising power generation is, programme for 2011 however, only part of the story.
Much more can be done to help customers, whether and beyond will enable residential or commercial, to reduce their continued growth for CO2 emissions through energy efficiency measures.
For Centrica this has been the benefit of all our about helping customers, whether in the UK or North America, to use less energy stakeholders, offering a rather than the traditional paradigm of competitive deal for maximising the energy we sell.
Homes in the UK are responsible for a quarter of the customers, creating UKs CO2 emissions, and programmes to further job opportunities, assist on insulation, high efficiency boilers, smart meters and microgeneration have and delivering superior the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in this sector by 20% over the next 10 years.

electricity that homes will be using will become lower carbon, the overall saving for households could amount to 35%.

International commodity done to help customers, costs are rising and, unless we are able to entirely offset this increase with increased whether residential or consumption savings, higher household commercial, to reduce bills are inevitable.
We need to be honest about this as an industry and as a nation their CO2 emissions and continue to take steps to protect the through energy efficiency most vulnerable in our society.
Centricas business model is now better balanced and is well placed to thrive, with most of our energy being sourced from our own lower carbon sources.
The opportunity for us is to help our customers through our growing services businesses to reduce their fuel bills for today and their emissions for tomorrow.
2010 performance Centrica delivered a strong financial and operational performance in 2010.
We reported a significant increase in year-onyear earnings in a competitive market and Upstream in the UK, our gas and oil continued to grow our downstream business delivered strong production operations, both in the UK and in North performance and benefited from higher America.

We know that in addition to delivering superior financial returns, it is vital to have a strong health and safety focused culture.
Safety is therefore embedded in our strategy and culture.
Over the past year we have been working hard across all of our businesses to raise awareness of health and safety issues.
We equip our employees with the competence and confidence to take responsibility for the safety of themselves and others.
We want to encourage everyone to do things only if they can be done safely: and to take the time to do things right.
As well as managing personal safety, we also focus on process safety, ensuring the safe operation of the complex, high hazard upstream assets in our gas production and power generation portfolios.
Safety is fundamental to the way we will measure our success.
Our lost time injury rate, which we now report as a key performance indicator, fell again in 2010 but we are still seeking significant further improvement.

Over six million of our services contracts are now insurance-based, meaning we are able to offer most customers a more flexible product range.
We also reached agreement with our service and repair engineers regarding new contract terms and conditions, enabling us to offer greater flexibility to meet increased customer demand for evening and weekend appointments and during peak winter periods.
