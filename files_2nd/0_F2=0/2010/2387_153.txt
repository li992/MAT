Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 34.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows that could be of a significantly different amount, or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows cash outflows for derivative hedging instruments based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair value liability where the instruments will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency interest rate swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $6,725 million at 31 December 2010 2009 $7,999 million to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.
These amounts represent the maximum exposure of the group, substantially all of which could be called within one year.
Other investments $ million 2010 2009 Current Non-current Non-current Listed 953 1,296 Unlisted 1,532 238 271 1,532 1,191 1,567 Other non-current investments comprise equity investments that have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
These investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and as such are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss arising as a result of changes in fair value recorded directly in equity.
Accumulated fair value changes are recycled to the income statement on disposal, or when the investment is impaired.
The fair value of listed investments has been determined by reference to quoted market bid prices and as such are in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Unlisted investments are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses and are in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
At 31 December 2010, current unlisted investments relate to repurchased gas pre-paid bonds see Note 35 for further information.
In 2010, no impairment losses were incurred relating to either unlisted investments or other listed investments.
In 2009, impairment losses were incurred of $13 million relating to unlisted investments and nil relating to other listed investments.
BP has pledged listed equity investments with a carrying value of $948 million as part of a financing arrangement.
As BP has retained substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the shares they continue to be reflected as an asset on the balance sheet, with a liability being reflected within finance debt.
BP can request to have the shares returned at any time with 20 days notice, up to the date of maturity in three tranches, up to December 2013, subject to repayment of the outstanding loan.
