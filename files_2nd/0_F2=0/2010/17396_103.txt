Post-employment benefit liabilities The Groups post-employment benefit liabilities are analysed below: Group 2010 2009 m m Retirement benefit liabilities 440.0 298.4 Other post-employment benefit liabilities 10.5 13.1 450.5 311.5 a Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates both dened benefit and dened contribution pension schemes.
The two main dened benefit schemes are the Atkins Pension Plan and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded final salary schemes.
The assets of both schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, which is a final salary funded dened benefit scheme, and a range of dened contribution schemes or equivalent.
On 1 September 2009 the terms of the Railways Pension Scheme were amended to offer two options regarding future benets.
The options were to receive future benets linked to final salary in exchange for higher contributions or to receive future benets linked to salary as at 1 September 2009 with future increases capped at ination.
Following consultation 83 members selected to cap their future benets which has resulted in a curtailment gain of 2.6m in the year.
The remaining members retained benets linked to final salary.
During the year as a result of a TUPE transfer 49 members transferred out of the Atkins section of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The bulk of the assets were transferred in January 2010 and the liabilities in respect of transferring members were valued at 31 December 2009.
The bulk transfer resulted in a settlement gain of 4.1m.
The Company also made a top-up payment to the receiving section to ensure full funding for protected members which amounted to 1.8m.
The payment was made directly to the receiving section and so does not appear in the disclosures for the Atkins section of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The net gain recognised in the income statement is 2.3m.
In the previous year, on 31 March 2009 the dened benefit section of the Atkins McCarthy pension scheme was closed to future accrual of benets for members who do not enjoy a statutory or contractual right to a final salary pension.
These members transferred to the Personal Retirement Savings Accounts Ireland PRSA Irish Life scheme with effect from 1 April 2009.
The Atkins Pension Plan was closed to future accrual of benets on 30 September 2007 and all members were transferred to a dened contribution section for future service where it was clear they did not enjoy a statutory or contractual right to a final salary pension.
Although the service accrual under the dened benefit sections ceased for these members, the link to final salary remains whilst employed by Atkins Limited unless opting out or retiring if sooner.
