Group reserves are low due to the capital restructuring undertaken at the time of flotation.
This does not impact on Britvic plcs ability to make dividend payments.
The liquidity of the group remains strong in particular in light of the refinancing of the groups committed facility in the prior period as well as the 2009 Notes secured in the current period and the 2010 Notes which will be secured in December 2010 subject to documentation and due diligence see note 23.
