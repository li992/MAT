Global seaborne iron ore demand discuss the waste-removal programme increased by 5% to 979 Mt, driven by a 19% in the newly created pit.
increase in demand from the steel industry in the rest of the world.
Index prices rose strongly during the year, with the 62% Fe Platts index averaging approximately $147 t CFR, up from $80 t in 2009.
The manganese ore and alloy market reflected the increase in world crude steel production and demand, resulting in significantly increased prices for alloy and ore during the year.
Production increased to meet demand, with furnaces reaching full capacity for the first time since 2008.
Operating performance Kumba Iron Ore Kumba generated an operating profit of $3.4billion, more than double the $1.5 billion for 2009, largely attributable to a 92% weighted average increase of realised iron ore export prices and a 6% increase in export sales volumes.
This was partly offset by the 15% strengthening of the rand against the dollar and the implementation of the South African mining royalty, effective from 1March 2010.
Total sales volumes increased by 8% to 43.1Mt.
Export sales volumes from Sishen Mine for the year increased by 1.9 Mt or achieved 13.3 Mt of production for the year, a focus on cost containment and the price 6% to 36.1 Mt.
Export sales volumes to China 0.3 Mt above the nameplate capacity of the environment, partially offset by an adverse of 19.8 Mt represented 61% of total export plant, through improved quality of plant feed change in product mix and plant availability volumes for the year, compared with 75% material and more efficient shutdown issues experienced in the early part of the during 2009.

Amap produced 4.0 million tonnes of Japan and South Korea increased by 54% to separation DMS plant decreased by 3% iron ore, a 52% increase.
Total domestic sales volumes for the to 28.1 Mt due to the failure of single-line cost profile at Amap remains in line with the year increased by 21% to 7.0 Mt due to higher equipment and less feedstock from the pit.

Volumes railed on the Sishen-Saldanha IOEC $15.83 per tonne increased by 15% increased by 5% to 36.5 Mt.
This performance compared with R98.83 $11.78 per tonne in Samancor was adversely impacted by industrial action at 2009.
This expected increase was driven by Samancor generated an operating profit of Transnet and significant derailments during a 24% increase in waste mining volume and $382 million, a 167% increase, due to higher the second and third quarters of 2010, before above inflation increases in the key input costs sales volumes and prices following the returning to a more solid performance in the of labour, diesel and electricity.
