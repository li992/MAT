Based on the position at 31 December 2010, over a full year, an increase of 100 basis points would have increased the net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 395,000 2009 186,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share by 0.49p 2009 0.23p.
The calculations are based on the cash balances as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
b Fixed rate bonds An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 December 2010 would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 678,000 2009 803,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 0.85p 2009 0.99p.
A decrease in bond yields would have had an equal and opposite effect.
The Convertible loan stocks having an element of equity are not included in this analysis as given the nature of the businesses and the risk profile of the balance sheets they are considered to have more equity like characteristics.
c Bank loans The effect of an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in 3 month LIBOR interest rates as at 31 December 2010 on the interest cost of the bank loans and the net income return has been eliminated through a 30 year floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap.
The swap generates payments or charges that offset changes in the 3 month LIBOR interest rate, so that the interest payable on the bank loans is effectively converted to a fixed rate loan at 4.8975% 2009 4.8975% plus margin cost.
The initial term of the swap on commencement at 30 years did not match the term of the loans, therefore, hedge accounting is not used and mark to market gains or losses on the swap are captured in the net return on ordinary activities as set out in d below.
d Floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap A decrease of 100 basis points on 30 year interest rates as at 31 December 2010 would have a direct mark to market effect on the value of the swap and net assets.
Based on the position as at 31 December 2010, over a full year, a decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased the gains on investments and net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 9,617,000 2009 9,059,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 12.03p 2009 11.18p.
An increase of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
iii Foreign Currency Risk The Companys reporting currency is sterling, but investments are made in overseas markets as well as the United Kingdom and the asset value can be affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
Furthermore many companies trade internationally both through foreign subsidiaries, and through exports.
The greatest foreign currency risk occurs when companies have a divergence in currencies for costs and revenues.
A much less risky exposure to currency is straight translation of sales and profits.
The List of Investments on pages 16 to 20 breaks down the portfolio by geographic listing.
However the location of the stock market quote only has a limited correlation to the costs, revenues and even activities of those companies, and so this note should not be regarded as a reliable guide to the sensitivity of the portfolio to currency movements.
For example, the holdings in the portfolio that have suffered most from US$ weakness are UK companies with dollar revenues and sterling costs.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
Overseas income is subject to currency fluctuations.
The Company does not hedge these currency fluctuations because it is impossible to quantify the effect for the reasons stated above.
However, from time to time the Manager takes a view by holding financial assets or liabilities in overseas currencies.

Financial instruments continued iii Foreign Currency Risk continued Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation by currency of listing is indicated below: At 31 December 2010 Other debtors Cash and and Net Investments deposits Loans creditors exposure 000 000 000 000 000 US dollar 120,967 3 120,970 Taiwan dollar 14,435 2,245 16,680 Korean won 9,952 33 9,985 Euro 8,994 14 8,980 Other overseas currencies 10,568 10,568 Exposure to currency risk on translation of valuations of securities listed in overseas currencies 164,916 2,278 11 167,183 Sterling 330,485 37,219 50,000 10,325 307,379 495,401 39,497 50,000 10,336 474,562 Includes net non-monetary assets of 49,000.
Foreign currency risk sensitivity At 31 December 2010, had sterling strengthened by 10% 2009: 10% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and net return on ordinary activities after taxation would have decreased by the amounts shown on page 51 based solely on translation of securities quoted in currencies overseas.
A 10% 2009: 10% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
However companies whose cost base diverges in currency terms from its sales will in the longer term have a significantly greater effect on valuation than simple translation.
In the short term investee companies generally cover their currency exposure to varying degrees.
There is insufficient publicly disclosed information to quantify this, but in the long term this effect is expected to dwarf simple translation of foreign listings in terms of both risk and reward, because many investee companies trade globally.
Furthermore the country of listing is not necessarily an indication of the geography of some or even any operational activities for investee companies.
The Manager does not use financial instruments to protect against currency movements.
From time to time financial leverage has been made using debt in overseas currencies.
