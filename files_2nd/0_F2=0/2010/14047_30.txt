Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year.
Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and applicable UK law.
Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on the going concern basis.
Restatement The prior year gures have been restated to reclassify the assets and liabilities of the Serco Group plc Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOP from amounts owed by subsidiary companies due within one year to an Own Share reserve.
This has resulted in a decrease in both current debtors and reserves of 15.4m.
Fixed asset investments Investments held as xed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Share-based payment The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were not fully vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme open to eligible employees which allows the purchase of shares at a discount.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Where the fair value of share options requires the use of a valuation model, fair value is measured by use of the Binomial Lattice or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take account of market conditions applicable to the option.
Dividends Dividends are approved by the Board of Directors, and recorded in the Companys financial statements in the period in which they are declared, appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company.

Accounting policies continued 'HULYDWLYH QDQFLDO LQVWUXPHQWV DQG KHGJLQJ DFWLYLWLHV Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the profit and loss account except where the derivative is a designated cash ow hedging instrument.
The accounting treatment of derivatives classied as hedges depends on their designation, which occurs on the date that the derivative contract is committed to.
The Company designates derivatives as: O a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability fair value hedge : O a hedge of the income cost of a highly probable forecast transaction or commitment cash ow hedge : and O a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.
Gains and losses on fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Gains or losses on cash ow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability, only gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassied to profit or loss in the same period as the asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Where the forecast transaction or commitment results in a non-financial asset or liability, any gains or losses previously deferred in equity are included in the cost of the related asset or liability if the forecast transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure.
Gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred to the profit and loss account in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For the ineffective portion of hedges or transactions that are not designated for hedge accounting under FRS 26, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the profit and loss account when the committed or forecast transaction is recognised in the profit and loss account.
However, where cash ow hedge accounting has been applied for a forecast or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account.
Where the Company hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the profit and loss account when the foreign operation is disposed of.
&XUUHQW WD[ Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
'HIHUUHG WD[ The charge for taxation takes account of taxation deferred because of differences between the timing of recognition of certain items for taxation purposes and for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is considered more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is recognised on a non-discounted basis using tax rates in force at the date the timing differences are expected to reverse.
