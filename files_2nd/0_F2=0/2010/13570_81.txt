expected dividends are based on the companys payments to shareholders in respect of the previous year.
PSP the fair value of shares awarded under the psp is calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends or equivalent during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of Ftse 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and tsR vesting.
this adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.
ShareSave the fair value of the options granted under the sharesave plan is calculated using a binomial pricing model that assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
this results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
APRA the fair value of shares awarded under ApRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends.
