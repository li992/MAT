ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union.
The particular policies adopted are described below.
a Accounting convention The financial statements have prepared under the historical cost convention, except as required in the valuation of certain financial instruments which are carried at fair value.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements deal with the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 30 September 2010.
Subsidiaries comprise all those entities over which the Group has control.
The results of businesses acquired are dealt with in the consolidated accounts from the date of acquisition.
In accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation: Special Purpose Entities companies owned by charitable trusts into which loans originated by Mortgage Trust Limited were sold as part of its securitisation programme, where the Group enjoys the benefits of ownership, are treated as subsidiaries.
Similarly, trusts set up to hold shares in conjunction with the Groups employee share ownership arrangements are also treated as subsidiaries.
c Goodwill Goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, representing the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of acquired assets, including intangible assets, is held on the balance sheet and reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment has occurred.
Negative goodwill is written off as it arises.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations to combinations taking place before its transition date to IFRS 1 October 2004.
Therefore any goodwill which was written off to reserves under UK GAAP will not be charged or credited to the profit and loss account on any future disposal of the business to which it relates.
d Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise purchased computer software and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Purchased computer software is capitalised where it has a sufficiently enduring nature and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is provided in equal instalments at a rate of 25% per annum.
Other intangible assets acquired in business combinations include brands and business networks and are capitalised in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Such assets are stated at attributed cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is provided in equal instalments at a rate of 6.67% per annum.
e Leases Leases are accounted for as operating or finance leases in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
A finance lease is deemed to be one which transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset concerned.
Any other lease is an operating lease.
Rental income and costs under operating leases are credited or charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the leases.
50 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC f Contract hire Motor vehicles acquired in connection with contract hire arrangements are sold to finance houses, who lease them to customers for a pre-determined period.
The Group has undertaken to repurchase these vehicles at the end of the lease term.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 17, the assets are not derecognised on the sale to the finance house and remain as the Groups assets and the consideration received is spread over the customers lease term.
g Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost for property held under a sale and leaseback transaction represents the sale value.
Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the lives of the assets.
The rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold premises 2% per annum Short leasehold premises over the term of the lease Computer hardware 25% per annum Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 15% per annum Company motor vehicles 25% per annum Motor vehicles subject to contract hire arrangements over the term of the lease h Associates The Groups interest in associated undertakings is valued at the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, as required by IAS 28 Investments in Associates.
The interest of the Group in the profit after tax of the associate is recognised in the income statement.
The Companys interest in the shares of associated undertakings is valued at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends received from the associate by the Company are included in income when they become receivable.
i Investments The Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less provision for impairment.
j Loans to customers Loans to customers are considered to be loans and receivables as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are therefore accounted for on the amortised cost basis.
Loans advanced are valued at inception at the initial advance amount, which is the fair value at that time, inclusive of procuration fees paid to brokers or other business providers and less initial fees paid by the customer.
Loans acquired from third parties are initially valued at the purchase consideration paid or payable.
Thereafter all loans to customers are valued at this initial amount less the cumulative amortisation calculated using the Effective Interest Rate EIR method.
The loan balances are then reduced where necessary by a provision for balances which are considered to be impaired.
The EIR method spreads the expected net income arising from a loan over its expected life.
The EIR is that rate of interest which, at inception, exactly discounts the future cash payments and receipts arising from the loan to the initial carrying amount.
The Groups policy is to hedge against any exposure to fixed rate loan assets.
k Finance lease receivables Finance lease receivables are included within Loans to Customers at the total amount receivable less interest not yet accrued, unamortised commissions and provision for doubtful debts.
Income from finance lease contracts is accounted for on the actuarial basis.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 51 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued l Impairment of loans and receivables Loans and receivables are reviewed for indications of possible impairment throughout the year and at each balance sheet date, in accordance with IAS 39.
Where loans exhibit objective evidence of impairment, the carrying value of the loans is reduced to the net present value of their expected future cash flows, including the value of the potential realisation of any security, discounted at the original EIR.
Loans are assessed collectively, grouped by risk characteristics and account is taken of any impairment arising due to events which are believed to have taken place but have not been specifically identified at the balance sheet date.
For financial accounting purposes provisions for impairments of loans to customers are held in an allowance account.
These balances are offset against the gross value of the loan when it is written off on the administration system.
After this point a salvage balance may be held in respect of any further recoveries expected on the loan.
m Amounts owed by or to group companies In the accounts of the Company balances owed by or to other group companies are carried at the current amount outstanding less any provision.
Where balances owing between group companies fall within the definition of either financial assets or financial liabilities given in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation they are classified as Loans and Receivables or Other financial liabilities, respectively.
n Cash and cash equivalents Balances shown as cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise demand deposits and short-term deposits with banks with initial maturities of not more than 90 days.
o Own shares Shares in The Paragon Group of Companies PLC held in treasury or by the trustees of the Groups employee share ownership plans are shown on the balance sheet as a deduction in arriving at total equity.
Own shares are stated at cost.
p Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences.
Temporary differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Tax relating to items taken directly to equity is also taken directly to equity.
q Borrowings Borrowings are carried in the balance sheet on the amortised cost basis.
The initial value recognised includes the principal amount received less any discount on issue or costs of issuance.
Interest and all other costs of the funding are expensed to the income statement as interest payable over the term of the borrowing on an Effective Interest Rate basis.
Gains on the purchase of the Groups Floating Rate Notes or corporate bonds are recognised as income at the time of the transaction.
r Finance lease payables Balances due on the lease arising from the sale and leaseback of a Group property are recognised in creditors at the total amount payable less interest not yet accrued.
Interest is accrued on the actuarial basis.
The profit which arose on the sale and leaseback transaction is held within deferred income and is being credited to profit over the lease term on a straight line basis.
52 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC s Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group comprise currency swap, interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of the existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All derivatives are carried in the balance sheet at fair value, as assets where the value is positive or as liabilities where the value is negative.
Fair value is based on market prices, where a market exists.
If there is no active market, fair value is calculated using present value models which incorporate assumptions based on market conditions and are consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement, except where such amounts are permitted to be taken to equity as part of the accounting for a cash flow hedge.
t Hedging For all hedges, the Group documents, at inception, the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management strategy and objectives for undertaking the transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging arrangements put in place are considered to be highly effective as defined by IAS 39.
For a fair value hedge, as long as the hedging relationship is deemed highly effective and meets the hedging requirements of IAS 39, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in income can be offset against the fair value loss or gain arising from the hedged item for the hedged risk.
For macro hedges hedges of interest rate risk for a portfolio of loan assets this fair value adjustment is disclosed in the balance sheet alongside the hedged item, for other hedges the adjustment is made to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability.
Only the net ineffectiveness of the hedge is charged or credited to income.
Where a fair value hedge relationship is terminated, or deemed ineffective, the fair value adjustment is amortised over the remaining term of the underlying item.
Where a derivative is used to hedge the variability of cash flows of an asset or liability, it may be designated as a cash flow hedge so long as this relationship meets the hedging requirements of IAS 39.
For such an instrument the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is taken initially to equity, with the ineffective part taken to profit or loss.
The amount taken to equity is released to the income statement at the same time as the hedged item affects the income statement.
Where a cash flow hedge relationship is terminated, or deemed ineffective, the amount taken to equity will remain there until the hedged transaction is recognised, or is no longer highly probable.
u Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on temporary differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that they will be recovered.
As required by IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to take account of the expected timing of realisation.
v Retirement benefit obligations The expected cost of providing pensions within the funded defined benefit scheme, determined on the basis of annual valuations by professionally qualified actuaries using the projected unit method, is charged to the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and do not form part of the result for the period, being recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets at the balance sheet date.
Both the return on investment expected in the period and the expected financing cost of the liability, as estimated at the beginning of the period are recognised in the result for the period.
Any variances against these estimates in the year form part of the actuarial gain or loss.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The charge to the income statement for providing pensions under defined contribution pension schemes is equal to the contributions payable to such schemes for the year.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 53 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued w Provisions Provisions are recognised where there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that this obligation will result in an outflow of resources and this outflow can be reliably quantified.
Provisions are discounted where this effect is material.
x Revenue The revenue of the Group comprises interest receivable and similar charges and other income.
The accounting policy for the recognition of each element of revenue is described separately within these accounting policies.
y Fee and commission income Other income includes administration fees charged to borrowers, which are credited when the related service is performed, fees charged to third parties for account administration services, which are credited as those services are performed, and commissions receivable on the sale of insurances, which are taken to profit at the point at which the Group becomes unconditionally entitled to the income.
z Share based payments In accordance with IFRS 2 Share based payments, the fair value at the date of grant of awards to be made in respect of options and shares granted under the terms of the Groups various share based employee incentive arrangements is charged to the profit and loss account over the period between the date of grant and the vesting date.
As permitted by IFRS 1, only those options and awards granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 1 January 2005 have been restated on transition to IFRS.
National Insurance on share based payments is accrued over the vesting period, based on the share price at the balance sheet date.
Where the allowable cost of share based awards for tax purposes is greater than the cost determined in accordance with IFRS 2, the tax effect of the excess is taken to reserves.
aa Dividends In accordance with IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date, dividends payable on ordinary shares are recognised in equity once they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date, but before the authorisation of the financial statements remain within shareholders funds.
bb Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions, assets and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
The functional currency of the Group is the pound sterling.
Transactions which are not denominated in sterling are translated into sterling at the spot rate of exchange on the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities which are not denominated in sterling are translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on retranslation are included in interest payable or interest receivable depending on whether the underlying instrument is an asset or a liability, except where deferred in equity in accordance with the cash flow hedging provisions of IAS 39. cc Segmental reporting The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described above for the Group as a whole.
Costs attributed to each segment represent the direct costs incurred by the segment operations and an allocation of the costs of areas of the business which serve all segments.
Such allocations are weighted by the value of loan assets in each segment, adjusted for the relative effort involved in the administration of each asset class.
54 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 4.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Certain of the balances reported in the financial statements are based wholly or in part on estimates or assumptions made by the directors.
There is, therefore, a potential risk that they may be subject to change in future periods.
The most significant of these are: a Impairment losses on loans to customers Impairment losses on loans are calculated based on statistical models.
The key assumptions revolve around estimates of future cash flows from customers accounts, their timing and, for secured accounts, the expected proceeds from the realisation of the property.
These key assumptions are based on observed data from historical patterns and are updated regularly based on new data as it becomes available.
In addition the directors consider how appropriate past trends and patterns might be in the current economic situation and make any adjustments they believe are necessary to reflect the current conditions.
The accuracy of the impairment calculations would therefore be affected by unexpected changes to the economic situation, variances between the models used and the actual results, or assumptions which differ from the actual outcomes.
In particular, if the impact of economic factors such as employment levels on customers is worse than is implicit in the model then the number of accounts requiring provision might be greater than suggested by the model, while falls in house prices, over and above any assumed by the model might increase the provision required in respect of accounts currently provided.
b Effective interest rates In order to determine the effective interest rate applicable to loans an estimate must be made of the expected life of each loan and hence the cash flows relating thereto.
These estimates are based on historical data and reviewed regularly.
The accuracy of the effective interest rate applied would therefore be compromised by any differences between actual borrower behaviour and that predicted.
c Fair values Where financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, in the majority of cases this can be derived by reference to quoted market prices.
Where such a quoted price is not available the valuation is based on cash flow models based, where possible, on independently sourced parameters.
The accuracy of the calculation would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements or other variances in the operation of the models or the assumptions used.
d Retirement benefits The present value of the retirement benefit obligation is derived from an actuarial calculation which rests on a number of assumptions.
Where actual conditions differ from those assumed the ultimate value of the obligation would be different.
e Goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisition The value of goodwill and intangible assets recognised on the Groups acquisition of TBMC was derived from the projected cash flows for that business at the time of acquisition, based on management forecasts.
The accuracy of this valuation would therefore be compromised by any differences between these forecasts and the levels of business activity that the entity might actually have been able to generate in the absence of the acquisition.
This valuation will also be affected by the accuracy of the discount factor used.
The carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets is dependent on the accuracy of the inputs into the impairment test described in note 25.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 55 5.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives in managing capital are: To safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk, availability and cost.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets, having particular regard to the relative costs and availability of debt and equity finance at any given time.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, issue or redeem other capital instruments, such as corporate bonds, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Board of Directors regularly review the proportion of working capital represented by debt and equity.
Net debt is calculated as total debt, other than securitised and warehouse debt, valued at principal value, less free cash up to a maximum of the total debt.
Adjusted equity comprises all components of equity i. e. share capital, share premium, minority interest, retained earnings, and revaluation surplus other than amounts recognised in equity relating to cash flow hedges.
The debt and equity amounts at 30 September 2010 and at 30 September 2009 were as follows: 2010 2009 m m Debt Corporate bond 110.0 110.0 Bank overdraft 0.1 0.3 Less: Applicable free cash 110.1 84.0 Net debt - 26.3 Equity Total equity 692.3 650.8 Less: cash flow hedging reserve 1.4 1.2 Adjusted equity 690.9 649.6 Total working capital 690.9 675.9 Debt - 3.9% Equity 100.0% 96.1% Total working capital 100.0% 100.0% In addition the Group held 37.7m of free cash in excess of that shown above.
The increased proportion of working capital represented by equity during 2010 resulted primarily from the operation of the policy described above.
56 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 6.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The principal financial risks arising from the Groups normal business activities are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Board operates through the Credit Committee and the Asset and Liability Committee to review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, as described in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 36 to 39, and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year and since the year end.
The position disclosed below is materially similar to that existing throughout the year.
Use of derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Such instruments are used only to limit the exposure of the Group to movements in market interest or exchange rates.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken, and hence all of the Groups derivative financial instruments are for commercial hedging purposes only.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures principally arising from fixed rate lending or borrowing and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
Hedge accounting is applied where appropriate, though it should be noted that some derivatives, while forming part of an economic hedge relationship, do not qualify for this accounting treatment under the IAS 39 rules, while in other cases hedge accounting has not been adopted either because natural accounting offsets are expected or because complying with the IAS 39 hedge accounting rules would be especially onerous.
The Group has designated a number of derivatives as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
In particular this treatment is used for: a hedging the interest rate risk of groups of fixed rate prepayable loan assets with interest rate derivatives on a portfolio basis.
The Group believes this solution is the most appropriate as it is consistent with the economic hedging approach taken by the Group to these assets.
b hedging the interest rate risk of fixed rate corporate bond borrowings with a designated fixed to floating interest rate swap, which was taken out for this specific purpose.
The Group has also designated cash flow hedging relationships, principally arising from currency borrowings, where a specified foreign exchange basis swap, set up as part of the terms of the borrowing is used.
The only derivative financial instrument held by the Company is the swap related to the fixed rate corporate bond borrowing described above.
Credit risk The Groups business objectives rely on maintaining a high-quality customer base and place strong emphasis on good credit management, both at the time of acquiring or underwriting a new loan, where strict lending criteria are applied, and in the collections process.
Primary responsibility for credit risk management across the Group lies with the Credit Committee.
The Credit Committee is made up of four senior members of staff, headed by the Finance Director.
Its key responsibilities include setting and reviewing credit policy, controlling applicant quality, tracking account performance against targets, agreeing product criteria and lending guidelines and monitoring performance and trends.
The assets of the Group and the Company which are subject to credit risk are set out below: The Group The Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Loans to customers note 33 8,911.2 9,314.3 - - Derivative financial assets note 37 1,160.3 1,287.5 8.0 8.7 Amounts owed by Group companies note 40 - - 125.8 88.5 Accrued interest note 40 0.5 0.5 0.6 - Cash note 41 536.7 480.4 143.6 78.8 Maximum exposure to credit risk 10,608.7 11,082.7 278.0 176.0 The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its loans to customers.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 57 6.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Credit risk continued While this maximum exposure represents the potential loss which might have to be accounted for by the Group, the terms on which the Groups loan assets are funded, described under Liquidity Risk below, limit the amount of principal repayments on the Groups securitised and warehouse borrowings in cases of capital losses on assets, significantly reducing the effective shareholder value at risk.
The Groups underwriting philosophy is based on a combination of sophisticated individual credit assessment and the automated efficiencies of a scored decision making process.
Information on each applicant is combined with data taken from a credit reference bureau to provide a complete credit picture of the applicant and the borrowing requested.
Key information is validated through a combination of documentation and statistical data which collectively provides evidence of the applicants ability and willingness to pay the amount contracted under the loan agreement.
First mortgages and secured loans are secured by charges over residential properties in England and Wales, or similar Scottish or Northern Irish securities.
Car loans are effectively secured by the financed vehicle.
Despite this security, in assessing credit risk, an applicants ability and propensity to repay the loan remain the principal factors in the decision to lend.
In considering whether to acquire loan assets, the Group reviews documentary and statistical evidence to achieve a level of confidence that the Groups investment will be recovered similar to that provided by the underwriting process.
In order to control credit risk relating to counterparties to the Groups derivative financial instruments and cash deposits, the Asset and Liability Committee determines which counterparties the Group will deal with, establishes limits for each counterparty and monitors compliance with those limits.
Such counterparties are typically highly rated banks and, for all cash deposits and derivative positions held within the Groups securitisation structures, must comply with criteria set out in the financing arrangements.
Where a derivative counterparty fails to meet the required criteria they are obliged under the terms of the instruments to set aside a cash collateral deposit.
The amounts of these cash collateral deposits, which do not form part of the Groups cash position, are given in note 37.
The Groups cash balances are held in sterling at London banks in current accounts and as short fixed term deposits.
Credit risk on these balances, and the interest accrued thereon, is considered to be immaterial.
58 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC An analysis of the indexed loan to value ratio for those loan accounts secured on property by value at 30 September 2010 is set out below.
2010 2010 2009 2009 First Secured First Secured Mortgages Loans Mortgages Loans %% %% Loan to value ratio Less than 70% 23.6 28.3 17.7 26.0 70% to 80% 23.0 14.8 16.5 13.2 80% to 90% 30.1 15.2 30.2 16.5 90% to 100% 19.2 14.7 30.0 14.2 Over 100% 4.1 27.0 5.6 30.1 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Average loan to value ratio 79.4 86.5 82.6 88.4 The number of accounts in arrears by asset class, based on the most commonly quoted definition of arrears for the type of asset, at 30 September 2010 and 30 September 2009, compared to the most recent available industry averages published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders CML and the Finance and Leasing Association FLA, was: 2010 2009 % % First mortgages Accounts more than three months in arrears Buy-to-Let accounts including receiver of rent cases 0.83 1.54 Buy-to-Let accounts excluding receiver of rent cases 0.10 0.29 Owner Occupied accounts 4.00 4.11 CML data for mortgage accounts more than three months in arrears at 30 September 2010 Buy-to-Let accounts including receiver of rent cases 2.45 3.23 Buy-to-Let accounts excluding receiver of rent cases 1.71 2.19 Owner Occupied accounts 2.20 2.45 All mortgages 2.15 2.42 Secured loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 9.36 7.94 FLA data for secured loans at 30 September 2010 24.40 19.80 Car loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 5.85 4.44 FLA data for all personal loans at 30 September 2010 4.80 5.00 Other loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 59.75 47.94 No published industry data for asset classes comparable to the Groups retail finance and other books has been identified.
During the year ended 30 September 2010 the CML has enhanced the analysis of its published data, enabling the Group to provide clearer comparisons of the performance of its loan book.
Accordingly additional data has been given for both 2010 and 2009.
The portfolio of buy-to-let mortgage assets acquired on 30 September 2010 has not been included above.
This portfolio was acquired for 20.7m at a discount to the total of its current balances and had not been brought within the Groups collection processes at the year end, so its performance is not directly comparable to other Group buy-to-let assets.
28.0% of these assets were more than three months in arrears at the year end.
The number of accounts in arrears will be higher for closed books such as the owner occupied mortgage book and the car finance, retail finance and unsecured loan books than for comparable active ones, as performing accounts pay off their balances.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 59 6.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Credit risk continued The payment status of the current balances of the Groups loan assets, at 30 September 2010 and at 30 September 2009 split between those accounts considered as performing and those included in the population for impairment testing, is shown below.
FIRST MORTGAGES 2010 2009 restated m m Not past due 7,852.2 7,928.9 Arrears less than 3 months 337.4 431.8 Performing accounts 8,189.6 8,360.7 Arrears 3 to 6 months 24.6 48.0 Arrears 6 to 12 months 28.9 53.7 Arrears over 12 months 53.4 61.9 Possessions and similar cases 48.6 80.0 Impairment population 155.5 243.6 8,345.1 8,604.3 During the year the Group has changed the analysis of arrears accounts used internally and now classifies Receiver of Rent cases which are unlet or in the process of being sold with possession cases, regardless of their arrears status, as this gives more useful information.
The arrears analysis at 30 September 2009 has been restated on a comparable basis.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Liquidity risk The Group uses securitisation to mitigate its exposure to liquidity risk, ensuring, as far as possible, that the maturities of assets and liabilities are matched.
The Groups loan assets are principally financed by asset backed loan notes Notes issued through the securitisation process.
In a securitisation deal a Group company, referred to as a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV will issue Notes secured on a pool of mortgage or other loan assets owned by the SPV.
The Notes have a maturity date later than the final repayment date for any asset in the pool, typically over thirty years from the issue date.
The noteholders are entitled to receive repayment of the Note principal out of principal funds generated by the loan assets from time to time, but their right to the repayment of principal is limited to the cash available in the SPV.
Similarly, payment of accrued interest to the noteholders is limited to cash generated within the SPV.
There is no requirement for any Group company other than the issuing SPV to make principal or interest payments in respect of the Notes.
This has the effect of matching the maturities of the assets and the related funding, substantially reducing the Groups exposure to liquidity risk.
Details of Notes in issue are given in note 52 and the assets backing the Notes are shown in notes 31 and 32.
In the Groups consumer finance SPVs, principal cash was not required to be repaid to noteholders during an initial period, but instead could be used to acquire new loans from the Group, subject to underwriting conditions being met.
Following the completion of this initial period, principal cash is repaid in the same way as for other SPVs.
The Group provides additional funding to the SPV at inception, subordinated to the external funding, which means that credit risk on the pool assets is retained within the Group.
The Group also receives the residual income generated by the assets.
These factors mean that the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets remain with the Group, and hence the loans remain on the Groups balance sheet.
Cash received in each SPV is held until the next interest payment date, after which the remaining balances become available to the Group.
Cash balances are also held within each SPV to provide credit enhancement for the particular securitisation, allowing principal payments to be made even if loans default.
In order to provide further credit enhancement in certain of the SPVs there exist specific economic trigger events which cause additional cash to be retained in the SPV, rather than being transferred to the Group.
While the Group can, if it chooses, contribute additional cash to cover these requirements, it is under no obligation to do so.
No such trigger event has occurred to date in any of the Groups SPVs and whether one arises in the future will depend on the performance of the general economy and its impact on mortgage and loan arrears.
However if such trigger events occurred in all of the SPVs, a total of 65.7m of additional cash would be retained in those companies 2009: 65.3m.
The cash balances of the SPV companies are included within the restricted cash balances disclosed in note 41.
New loan originations are held within a revolving warehouse facility from the point of their origination until their inclusion in a securitisation deal.
A warehouse functions in a similar way to an SPV, except that funds are drawn down as advances are made and repaid when loans are securitised.
Before 29 February 2008 a warehouse facility was provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited.
On this date the warehouse ceased to be available for new drawings, although assets held within it at that time continued to be funded.
Repayment of the principal on these assets is not required unless amounts are realised from them.
The final repayment date of the facility is later than the final due date of the assets it is used to fund.
On 27 September 2010 a new warehouse facility agreement was signed with Macquarie Bank.
This warehouse is available for drawing and redrawing until 21 December 2012 for the purpose of funding new first charge mortgage loans.
After that the loan has a further two year period for the assets funded to be sold or refinanced.
Repayment of the principal drawn in respect of assets is not required unless amounts are realised from them, even after the two year period.
There is no further recourse to the assets of the Group in respect of either interest or principal on the borrowing.
As with the SPVs, the Group provides funding to the warehouse companies and restricted cash balances are held within them.
Further details of the warehouse facilities are given in note 52 and details of the loan assets within the warehouses are given in note 31.
Between 29 February 2008 and 30 September 2010 the only advances made by the Group were consumer loans and further advances on existing mortgage accounts, which are funded using the existing drawings in the SPV companies.
The provision of new consumer loans ceased on 9 April 2009, except for further advances on existing accounts, when the period over which new loans could be sold to the consumer finance SPVs ended.
The securitisation process and the terms of the warehouse facilities effectively limit liquidity risk from the funding of the Groups loan assets.
It remains to ensure that sufficient funding is available to fund the Groups participation in the SPVs, provide capital support for new loans and working capital for the Group.
This responsibility rests with the Asset and Liability Committee which sets the Groups liquidity policy and uses detailed cash flow projections to ensure that an adequate level of liquidity is available at all times.
62 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The final repayment date for all of the securitisation borrowings and the old warehouse borrowing is more than five years from the balance sheet date, the earliest falling due in 2033 and the latest in 2050.
The equivalent sterling principal amount outstanding at 30 September 2010 under these arrangements, allowing for the effect of the cross currency basis swaps, described under currency risk below, which are net settled with the loan payments, was 8,598.3m 2009: 9,007.3m.
The total sterling amount payable under these arrangements, were these principal amounts to remain outstanding until the final repayment date would be 19,550.9m 2009: 21,413.7m.
As the principal will, as discussed above, reduce as customers repay or redeem their accounts, the cash flow will in practice be far less than this amount.
The total undiscounted amounts, inclusive of estimated interest, which would be payable in respect of the Groups other borrowings, should those balances remain outstanding until the contracted repayment date, together with amounts payable in respect of the other accruals shown in note 57 are shown below.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Interest rate risk The Group manages interest rate risk, the risk that margins will be adversely affected by movements in market interest rates, by maintaining floating rate liabilities and matching these with floating rate assets, hedging fixed rate assets and liabilities by the use of interest rate swap or cap agreements.
The rates of interest payable on the loan facilities and on asset backed loan notes issued in the securitisation process are reset quarterly on the basis of LIBOR.
Where asset backed loan notes are issued in foreign currencies, cross-currency basis swaps are put in place converting the reference interest rate to a sterling LIBOR basis.
The Groups assets predominantly bear LIBOR linked interest rates or are hedged fixed rate assets.
The interest rates charged on the Groups variable rate loan assets are determined by reference to, inter alia, the Groups funding costs and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
Generally this ensures the matching of changes in interest rates on the Groups loan assets and borrowings and any exposure arising on the interest rate resets is relatively short term.
Forward rate agreements may be used to hedge against any perceived risk of temporary increases in LIBOR rates at month ends.
The fixed rate corporate bond is hedged by use of a long-term interest rate swap agreement, of notional principal equal to the principal amount of the bond.
This swap is in place until the optional repayment date in 2012 and converts the interest payable to a LIBOR-linked floating rate basis.
The Group has entered into various interest rate basis swap arrangements to alter the effective basis of interest payments on certain borrowings to match the underlying assets, though due to their nature and the low notional value of these swaps, they do not have a significant impact on the Groups results.
The Asset and Liability Committee monitors the interest rate risk exposure on the Groups loan assets and asset backed loan notes and ensures compliance with the requirements of the trustees in respect of the Groups securitisations.
To assess the Groups exposure to interest rate movements the notional impact of a 1% change in UK interest rates on the equity of the Group at 30 September 2010, and the notional annualised impact of such a change on the operating profit of the Group, based on the year end balance sheet have been calculated.
On this basis a 1% increase in UK interest rates would reduce the Groups equity at 30 September 2010 by 4.3m 2009: 4.5m and increase profit before tax by 5.1m 2009: increase profit before tax by 3.8m.
This calculation allows only for the direct effects of any change in UK interest rates.
In practice such a change might have wider economic consequences which would themselves potentially effect the Groups business and results.
Although certain of the Groups borrowings have interest rates dependant on US Dollar and Euro LIBOR rates, the effect of the cross currency basis swaps is such that the Groups results have no material exposure to movements in these rates.
The effects of independent 1% increases in US or Euro interest rates would be to increase the Groups equity by 1.4m 2009: 1.4m and 2.4m 2009: 2.7m respectively.
The only interest rate risk in the Company arises from the corporate bond described above which is a fixed rate instrument, until its maturity in 2017, which is fully hedged.
Loans to associates and inter company assets and liabilities bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR which reset within three months of the balance sheet date.
The finance lease bears notional interest only: all other balances are non-interest bearing.
64 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Currency risk All of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling with the exception of the asset backed loan notes denominated in US dollars and euros, which are described in note 52.
Although IAS 39 requires that they be accounted for as currency liabilities and valued at their spot rates, it was a condition of the issue of these notes that interest rate and currency swaps were put in place for the duration of the borrowing, having the effect of converting the liability to a LIBOR linked floating rate sterling borrowing.
As a result the Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk, and no sensitivity analysis is presented for currency risk.
The equivalent sterling principal amounts of notes in issue under these arrangements, and their carrying values at 30 September 2010 and 30 September 2009 are: 2010 2010 2009 2009 Equivalent Carrying Equivalent Carrying sterling value sterling value principal principal m m m m US dollar notes 3,054.8 3,652.3 3,177.3 3,717.8 Euro notes 2,108.2 2,663.9 2,191.8 2,930.1 5,163.0 6,316.2 5,369.1 6,647.9 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values have been determined for all derivatives, listed securities and any other financial assets and liabilities for which an active and liquid market exists.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair values in the accounts.
The Group uses a number of techniques to determine the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities, for which observable prices in active markets are not available.
These are principally present value calculations based on estimated future cash flows arising from the instruments, discounted using a risk adjusted interest rate.
The principal inputs to these valuation models are LIBOR benchmark interest rates for the currencies in which the instruments are denominated, sterling, euros and dollars.
The cross currency basis swaps have a notional principal related to the outstanding currency borrowings and therefore the estimated rate of repayment of these notes also affects the valuation of the swaps.
In order to determine the fair values the management applies valuation adjustments to observed data where that data would not fully reflect the attributes of the instrument being valued.
The management reviews the models used on an ongoing basis to ensure that the valuations produced are reasonable and reflect all relevant factors.
For assets and liabilities carried at fair value IFRS 7 requires that the measurements should be classified using a fair value hierarchy reflecting the inputs used, and defines three levels.
Level 1 measurements are unadjusted market prices, level 2 measurements are derived from observable data, such as market prices or rates, while level 3 measurements rely on significant inputs which are not derived from observable data.
As described above the valuations of the Groups derivatives are based on market information and they are therefore classified as level 2 measurements.
Details of these assets are given in note 37.
The Group had no financial assets or liabilities in the year ended 30 September 2010 or the year ended 30 September 2009 valued using level 1 or level 3 measurements.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts and asset backed loan notes, which are carried at amortised cost, are not materially different from their book values because all the assets mature within three months of the year end and the interest rates charged on financial liabilities reset on a quarterly basis.
While the Groups asset backed loan notes are listed, the quoted prices for an individual note may not be indicative of the fair value of the issue as a whole, due to the specialised nature of the market in such instruments and the limited number of investors participating in it.
In the absence of a liquid market in loan assets the directors have considered the estimated cash flows expected to arise from the Groups investments in its loans to customers and have concluded that the carrying value of these assets, determined on the amortised cost basis, is not significantly different from the fair value of the assets derived on a discounted cash flow basis.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION For internal reporting purposes the Group is organised into two major operating divisions, First Mortgages and Consumer Finance.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports segmental information.
The revenue generated by the First Mortgages segment includes interest and fees generated by the buy-to-let and owner-occupied mortgage assets and other income derived from first charge mortgages.
Consumer Finance revenue includes interest and fees generated by second charge loans and the residual car and retail finance and unsecured loan assets, and other sources of income derived from the consumer loans.
All of the Groups operations are conducted in the United Kingdom, all revenues arise from external customers and there are no inter-segment revenues.
No customer contributes more than 10% of the revenue of the Group.

SHARE BASED REMUNERATION During the year the Group had various share based payment arrangements with employees.
They are accounted for by the Group and the Company as shown below.
The effect of the share based payment arrangements on the Groups profit is shown in note 13.
Further details of share based payment arrangements are given in the Report of the Board to the Shareholders on Directors Remuneration on pages 27 to 32. a Share option schemes Options under the Executive Share Option Executive schemes have been granted to directors and senior employees from time to time, on the basis of performance and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
These options vest so long as the grantee is still employed by the Group at the end of the vesting period and, where applicable, performance criteria have been satisfied.
The Executive schemes are no longer available for the grant of further awards.
The Group also operates an All Employee Share Option Sharesave scheme.
Grants under this scheme vest after the completion of the appropriate service period and subject to a savings requirement.
A reconciliation of movements in the number and weighted average exercise price of options over 1 ordinary shares during the year ended 30 September 2010 and the year ended 30 September 2009 is shown below.

A number of the above options were granted to former employees whose rights terminate at the later of twelve months following redundancy or forty-two months after the issue of the options.
The fair value of options granted is determined using a Binomial model.
Details of the awards over 1 ordinary shares made in the year ended 30 September 2010, which were all made under the Sharesave scheme, are shown below.
No grants were made in the year ended 30 September 2009.

72 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC b Paragon Performance Share Plan Awards under this plan comprise a right to acquire ordinary shares in the Company for nil or nominal payment and will vest on the third anniversary of their granting, to the extent that the applicable performance criteria have been satisfied, if the holder is still employed by the Group.
The awards will lapse to the extent that the performance condition has not been satisfied on the third anniversary.
The growth in the Companys EPS as adjusted for a common rate of corporation tax and its TSR will be compared over the vesting period to the performance of a group of designated comparator companies.
35% of each element of the award will vest for median performance with full vesting for upper quartile performance: between these points awards will vest on a straight line basis.
For below median performance, none of the relevant element of the award will vest.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will have regard to the underlying financial performance of the Company as compared with the level of TSR and EPS performance.
The receipt of these shares is subject to the Companys TSR exceeding the TSR of a comparator group drawn from the FTSE All Share Banks and General Financial sectors.
No part of an award will vest for below median performance, 35% will vest for median performance and 100% will vest for upper quartile performance.
Between median and upper quartile performance, awards will vest on a straight line basis.
The receipt of these shares is subject to an absolute TSR performance condition, whereby the increase in the net return index over the performance period, based on a share price that is equivalent on the grant date to 125 pence per share, must at least equal compound annual growth of 10%.
35% of the awards will vest for 10% compound annual growth over the performance period, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for compound annual growth of 15%.
The performance period is the three year period commencing on the date of grant.
The receipt of these shares is subject to a performance condition comparing the rank of the Companys TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE-250 on the date of grant over the three years commencing on the date of grant.
25% of the awards will vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
The number of awards outstanding under each of the arrangements shown above was adjusted in accordance with the scheme rules, following the share consolidation on 29 January 2008 and the rights issue on 21 February 2008.
During the year the outstanding awards were modified so that awards vesting would be exercisable for a period of seven years after the vesting date rather than six months.
This change had no incremental effect on the fair value of the awards, as it implied no changes in any of the assumptions used in the valuations.

SHARE BASED REMUNERATION continued The fair value of awards granted under the Performance Share Plan is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, to take account of the effect of the market based condition.
Details of the awards over 1 ordinary shares made in the year ended 30 September 2010 and the year ended 30 September 2009 are shown below: Grant date 02 09 10 04 01 10 21 05 09 Number of awards granted 141,844 1,903,737 3,419,550 Market price at date of grant 140.00p 135.20p 70.75p Fair value per share at date of grant 103.35p 99.36p 11.67p Inputs to valuation model Expected volatility 85.51% 84.76% 82.78% Risk-free interest rate 1.51% 2.04% 2.13% Expected dividend yield 2.43% 2.44% 4.43% For all of the above grants the contractual life and expected life at grant date is three years and no departures are expected.
For awards granted before 18 July 2008 the expected volatility of the share price used in determining the fair value was based on the annualised standard deviation of daily changes in price over the previous year from the grant date.
The expected volatility for awards granted between this date and 30 September 2008 is calculated using the same method but using daily changes in price over the six years preceding the grant date.
The expected volatility for awards granted after this date is calculated using the same method but using daily changes in price over the three years preceding the grant date.

The directors currently expect that these borrowings will be repaid in full and the present values of such cash flows will not be materially different to the carrying value.
The gains described above have been made on purchases in a market with a very low level of activity, where the prices which can be achieved in one-off transactions will not necessarily be representative of the fair value of the liabilities concerned.

Some accounting volatility arises on these items due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges, or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain items.
The losses and gains are primarily due to timing differences in income recognition between the derivative instruments and the economically hedged assets and liabilities.

The expected impact of this change on the values at which deferred tax amounts are expected to crystallise has been accounted for in the year ended 30 September 2010.
The Government has announced its intention to make further reductions in the rate of corporation tax in future years.
The effect of any such changes on deferred tax balances will be accounted for in the period in which any such changes are enacted.

GOODWILL The goodwill carried in the accounts was recognised on the acquisition of The Business Mortgage Company and its subsidiaries TBMC in December 2008.
The cash generating unit to which this goodwill was attributed for impairment testing purposes was TBMC, which is the lowest level within the Group at which this goodwill is currently monitored, though the operations of the acquired entity will, in time, be integrated with those of the First Mortgage division.
An impairment review undertaken at 30 September 2009 indicated a write down of 6.0m which was charged to the profit and loss account.
A further review was undertaken at 30 September 2010, which indicated no further impairment.
The recoverable amount of TBMC used in this impairment testing is determined on a value in use basis using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board covering a 4 year period.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projection is 7.25% and cash flows beyond the 4 year budget are extrapolated using a 2.40% growth rate, being the average long term growth rate in the United Kingdom economy over a twenty year period.
The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for the TBMC business are: Level of business activity, based on management expectations.
Management have concluded that the levels of activity assumed for the purpose of this forecast are reasonable, based on past experience and the current economic environment.
Discount rate, which is based on the Groups cost of capital.
The directors believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions above would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 85 31.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES continued Mortgage loans have a contractual term of up to thirty years, secured loans up to twenty five years, retail finance loans up to ten years and other unsecured loans up to ten years.
In all cases the borrower is entitled to settle the loan at any point and in most cases early settlement does take place.
All borrowers are required to make monthly payments, except where an initial deferred period is included in the contractual terms.
Under the terms of certain first mortgage products, the customer has the right to draw down further funds.
At 30 September 2010 the Groups commitment in respect of such facilities was 43.3m 2009: 48.6m.
The loans shown above pledged as collateral for the liabilities described in note 52 at 30 September 2010 and 30 September 2009 were: First Consumer Total Mortgages Finance m m m 30 September 2010 In respect of: Asset backed loan notes 6,915.5 397.6 7,313.1 Warehouse facilities 1,514.0 - 1,514.0 Total pledged as collateral 8,429.5 397.6 8,827.1 Not pledged as collateral 46.1 17.0 63.1 8,475.6 414.6 8,890.2 30 September 2009 In respect of: Asset backed loan notes 7,166.0 479.1 7,645.1 Warehouse facilities 1,566.4 - 1,566.4 Total pledged as collateral 8,732.4 479.1 9,211.5 Not pledged as collateral 31.9 22.6 54.5 8,764.3 501.7 9,266.0 32.
FINANCE LEASE RECEIVABLES The Groups finance lease receivables are car finance loans.
The average contractual life of such loans is 56 months 2009: 56 months, but it is likely that a significant proportion of customers will choose to settle their obligations early.

Whilst the Group has the benefit of the underlying vehicle as security on these loans, no account of this is taken in the allowance for uncollectible amounts shown above.
The Group has insufficient information on the current condition of finance leased vehicles to derive a reliable estimate of the value which could be realised from vehicles to offset against arrears accounts.
Accordingly, no such disclosure is provided.

The fair value of loans to customers is considered to be not materially different to the amortised cost value at which they are disclosed.

IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS ON LOANS TO CUSTOMERS The following amounts in respect of impairment provisions, net of allowances for recoveries of written off assets, have been deducted from the appropriate assets in the balance sheet.
FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS FROM PORTFOLIO HEDGING The Group applies fair value hedge accounting in respect of portfolios of loan assets where the appropriate criteria are met.
In these circumstances the change in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk is shown under this heading.
LOANS TO ASSOCIATE The Groups associated undertaking became a subsidiary on 17 December 2008.
After that date the loan balances were eliminated on consolidation.
Loans to the associated undertaking at 30 September 2008 were all denominated and payable in sterling.
Interest is charged on these loans at a fixed margin above six-month LIBOR.
Details of these loans are shown below.
2008 m Carrying value m 15.5 Outstanding principal m 16.2 Maximum contractual life months 108 Average contractual life months 76 Maximum remaining life months 88 Average remaining life months 56 Average margin charged above LIBOR 5.06% The fair values of these loans were not considered to be significantly different to their carrying values and the effective interest rates were not materially different to the rates charged.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES All of the Groups financial derivatives are held for economic hedging purposes, although not all may be designated for hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39.
The analysis below therefore splits derivatives between those accounted for as hedges and those which, while representing an economic hedge, do not qualify for this treatment.
All of the financial derivatives shown are valued using methodologies where the principal inputs are directly or indirectly derived from market data and are therefore classified within level two of the fair value hierarchy laid down by IFRS 7.
The Groups securitisation borrowings are denominated in sterling, euros and US dollars.
All currency borrowings are swapped at inception so that they have the effect of sterling borrowings.
These swaps provide an effective hedge against exchange rate movements, but the requirement to carry them at fair value leads, when exchange rates have moved significantly since the issue of the notes, to large balances for the swaps being carried in the balance sheet.
This is currently the case with both euro and US dollar swaps, although the debit balance is compensated for by retranslating the borrowings at the current exchange rate.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within Financial Assets note 30 and Financial Liabilities note 51 respectively.

BORROWINGS All borrowings shown as falling due after more than one year fall due after more than five years.
The fair values of borrowings are not considered to be significantly different to their carrying values and the effective interest rates are not materially different to the rates charged.
a Asset backed loan notes The asset backed loan notes are secured on portfolios comprising variable and fixed rate mortgages or personal, retail and car loans, and are redeemable in part from time to time, but such redemptions are limited to the net capital received from borrowers in respect of the underlying assets.
There is no requirement for the Group to make good any shortfall out of general funds.
The maturity date of the notes matches the maturity date of the underlying assets.
It is likely that a substantial proportion of these notes will be repaid within five years.
In each issue there exists an option for the Group to repay all of the notes at an earlier date the call date, at the outstanding principal amount.
Interest is payable at a fixed margin above: the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR on notes denominated in sterling: the Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR on notes denominated in euros: and the London Interbank Offered Rate US Dollar LIBOR on notes denominated in US dollars.
All payments in respect of the notes are required to be made in the currency in which they are denominated.
The notes outstanding at 30 September 2010 comprised 7,877.8m 2009: 8,225.9m, 2008: 8,241.6m in respect of mortgage backed notes and 458.4m 2009: 593.3m, 2008: 787.1m in respect of notes backed by other loan assets.

98 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC b Bank borrowings Prior to the recent difficulties in the capital markets, assets were typically securitised within twelve months of origination.
New loans were funded by a bank facility the old warehouse facility.
This was drawn down to fund completions and repaid when assets were securitised.
More information on this process is given in note 6.
The old warehouse facility was available for further drawings until 29 February 2008 at which point it converted automatically to a term loan and no further drawings were allowed.
The old warehouse facility is provided by a committed sterling facility provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited by a consortium of banks.
This facility is secured on all the assets of Paragon Second Funding Limited, Paragon Car Finance No.
1 Limited and Paragon Personal Finance No.
1 Limited and although its final repayment date is 28 February 2050 it is likely that substantial repayments will be made within the next five years.
Interest on this loan is payable monthly in sterling at 0.675% above LIBOR 2009: 0.675% above LIBOR.
The principal amount outstanding on the facility at 30 September 2010, which was also the maximum available amount, was 1,403.6m 2009: 1,453.1m.
The carrying value of the borrowing in the balance sheet was 1,403.6m 2009: 1,453.1m.
Details of assets held within the old warehouse are given in note 32.
As with the asset backed loan notes, repayments of this facility before the final repayment date are restricted to the amount of principal cash realised from the funded assets.
In order to provide funding for new lending, on 27 September 2010 the Group entered into a 200.0m committed sterling facility provided to Paragon Fourth Funding Limited by Macquarie Bank plc the new warehouse.
This facility is secured on all the assets of Paragon Fourth Funding Limited and is available for drawing for a period of two years and has a term of four years.
It is the Groups intention to refinance loans originated in the new warehouse in the mortgage backed securitisation market when appropriate.
Interest on this loan is payable monthly in sterling at 2.875% above LIBOR.
The facility has a renewal process that allows the Group to agree a new two year commitment period prior to the expiry of the existing commitment period.
No amounts had been drawn on this facility at 30 September 2010 and hence the maximum available drawing at that date was 200.0m 2009: nil.
As with the old warehouse, repayments on the new warehouse are limited to principal cash received from the funded assets.
The Group additionally has entered into 64.8m 2009: 79.8m of sterling revolving credit facilities to fund, where necessary, the purchase of mortgage redraws in certain subsidiary companies.
At 30 September 2010 nil 2009: nil had been drawn down under these facilities.
The weighted average margin above LIBOR on bank borrowings at 30 September 2010 was 0.675% 2009: 0.675%.
c Corporate bond On 20 April 2005 the Company issued 120.0m of 7% Callable Subordinated Notes at an issue price of 99.347% to provide long term capital for the Group.
These bonds bear interest at a fixed rate of 7% per annum and are repayable on 20 April 2017, but may be repaid on 20 April 2012 at the Companys option.
They are unsecured and subordinated to any other creditors of the Company.
At 30 September 2010 115.8m 2009: 126.8m was included within the financial liabilities of the Company in respect of these bonds.
At 30 September 2009 bonds to the principal value of 10.0m were held by other group companies and hence the value included within the financial liabilities of the Group in respect of these bonds was 116.8m.
During the year ended 30 September 2010 these notes were cancelled, realising a profit of 10.0m in the Company, and at 30 September 2010 none of the bonds were held by other entities within the Group and therefore the value included within the financial liabilities of the Group in respect of the bonds at 30 September 2010 was the same as that for the Company.

OBLIGATIONS UNDER FINANCE LEASES The finance lease obligations recorded in the accounts arise from a sale and leaseback transaction of the Groups former head office building in 1997 which falls to be treated as a finance lease under IAS 17 - Leases.
The lease expires in 2019 and is subject to five yearly rent reviews, with guaranteed minimum rent increases.
The minimum lease payments payable under this lease are: 2010 2009 2008 m m m Amounts payable Within one year 1.9 1.9 2.0 Within two to five years 8.2 8.0 7.8 After five years 7.0 9.1 11.2 17.1 19.0 21.0 Less: future finance charges 5.3 6.4 7.6 Present value of lease obligations 11.8 12.6 13.4 The present value of these payments recognised in the financial statements is: 2010 2009 2008 m m m Amounts payable Within one year 0.9 0.8 0.8 Within two to five years 5.0 4.3 3.8 After five years 5.9 7.5 8.8 11.8 12.6 13.4 The fair value of the lease obligation is not considered to be materially different to the present value of the future obligations shown above.
The interest rate implicit in the lease is 9.13% 2009: 9.13% At 30 September 2010 the minimum amount of payments expected to be received in respect of non-cancellable sub-leases in respect of this building was 1,100,000 2009: 2,100,000.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK the Plan.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2007 and updated to 30 September 2010 by a qualified independent actuary.
A full actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010 is currently being carried out.
The results of this valuation will be used in compiling the financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2011.
The liabilities of the Plan are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the Projected Unit method.
This amount is reflected in the liability in the balance sheet.
The Projected Unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the technical provisions are calculated based on service up until the valuation date allowing for future salary growth until the date of retirement, withdrawal or death, as appropriate.
The future service rate is then calculated as the contribution rate required to fund the service accruing over the control period again allowing for future salary growth.
As a result of the Plan being closed to new entrants, the service cost as a percentage of pensionable salaries is expected to increase as the members of the Plan approach retirement.
However the membership is expected to reduce so that the service charge in monetary terms will gradually reduce.
The major weighted average assumptions used by the actuary were in nominal terms : 30 September 30 September 30 September 2010 2009 2008 In determining net pension cost for the year Discount rate 5.70% 6.50% 6.10% Expected long term rate of return on scheme assets 6.60% 7.70% 7.20% Rate of compensation increase 4.20% 4.35% 4.10% Rate of increase of pensions in payment accrued before 6 April 2006 3.20% 3.35% 3.10% in payment accrued after 5 April 2006 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% in deferment 3.20% 3.35% 3.10% In determining benefit obligations Discount rate 5.20% 5.70% 6.50% Rate of compensation increase 4.00% 4.20% 4.35% Rate of increase of pensions in payment accrued before 6 April 2006 3.00% 3.20% 3.35% in payment accrued after 5 April 2006 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% in deferment 3.00% 3.20% 3.35% Further life expectancy at age 60 Pensioner male 30 30 30 Pensioner female 33 33 33 Non-retired member male 31 31 31 Non-retired member female 35 35 35 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 101 54.

The trustees of the Plan are required to act in the best interests of the Plans beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees to the Plan is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by active and pensioner members of the Plan.
At 30 September 2010 the Plan assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and gilt investments.
The majority of the equities held by the Plan are in developed markets.
The target asset allocations for the year ending 30 September 2011 are 55% equities, 25% bonds and 20% other assets.
In conjunction with the trustees, the Group has continued to conduct asset-liability reviews of the Plan.
These studies are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the Plan.
The results of the studies are used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the scheme deficit by providing information used to determine the investment strategy of the Plan.
Following the 2007 actuarial valuation, the trustees put in place a recovery plan.
The trustees recovery plan aims to meet the statutory funding objective within ten years and nine months from the date of valuation, i. e. by 1 January 2018.
The rate of return expected on scheme assets is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The movement in the market value of the scheme assets during the year was as follows: 2010 2009 m m At 1 October 2009 52.0 43.9 Movement in year Contributions by the Group 2.3 2.3 Contributions by scheme members 0.3 0.3 Benefits paid 1.4 0.8 Expected return on scheme assets 3.6 3.5 Actuarial gain 0.4 2.8 At 30 September 2010 57.2 52.0 The actual rate of return on scheme assets in the year ended 30 September 2010 was 7.8% 2009: 14.5%.

An actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010 is in progress, but the results have not been finalised.
The sensitivity of the valuation of the scheme liabilities to the principal assumptions disclosed above at 30 September 2010 is as follows: Assumption Increase in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate 0.1% p. a.
Decrease by 2.6% Rate of inflation 0.1% p. a.

With the significant downturn in market activity during 2008 the business of TBMC suffered and, in order to secure the future of this strategically important business channel, the Group agreed to a reorganisation of TBMC whereby it accepted the remaining 67% of the equity on 17 December 2008, bringing the company within the Group, and suspended interest payments on its loan to TBMC.
No payment was made in respect of the shares accepted.
This transaction was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
