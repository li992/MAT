Share-based payments 2005 Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP, senior executives can be granted nil exercise price options normally exercisable three to ten years following grant over shares worth up to 200% of salary p. a.
Awards made before 8 March 2010 were made as conditional awards to acquire free shares on vesting.
To provide flexibility to participants, those awards have been converted into nil exercise price options.
Awards granted in 2010 vest subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition.
Half of an award is tested against constituents of the FTSE 100 index excluding investment trusts and the other half against a comparator group of oil and gas companies.
Performance is measured over a fixed three-year period starting on 1 January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for the shares to vest.
No dividends are paid over the vesting period.
There are further details of PSP award measurement in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 86 to 94.

Options normally only become exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant and if the performance condition has been met.
The awards are tested against constituents of an index and 100% of awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median of the index over three years following grant.
For awards from March 2008 the Index is the FTSE 100 index excluding investment trusts : for awards before March 2008, the Index is the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts.
Options granted under the previous 1998 ESOS had all been exercised at 31 December 2009.
All awards under the 1998 ESOS were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the IFRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options under the 2000 ESOS during the year.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2010 had exercise prices of 79p to 1,299.9p 2009: 63.0p to 1,179.0p and remaining contractual lives of 1 to 10 years.
The fair values were calculated using a proprietary binomial valuation model.
The principal inputs to the options valuation model were: Risk-free interest rate 1.8-2.5% pa Expected volatility 49% Dividend yield 0.5% pa Employee turnover 5% pa Early exercise At rates dependent upon potential gain from exercise Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected lifetime of the awards.
