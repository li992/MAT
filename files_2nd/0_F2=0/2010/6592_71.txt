The operating activities of the Group are largely structured according to the markets served: automotive, aerospace and the land systems markets.
automotive is managed according to product groups: driveline and powder metallurgy.
reportable segments derive their sales from the manufacture of product.
revenue from services, inter segment trading and royalties is not significant.
on 16 June 2M1M the Group announced the formation of GKN Land Systems.
Land Systems brought together the operations of GKN offHighway excluding axles, GKN autoStructures and GKN Industrial and Distribution Services.
Land Systems builds on existing strengths in the agricultural, mining and construction equipment markets with a strategic focus on developing these and new markets in defence vehicles, mass transit and renewable energy.
autoStructures was included in the former other automotive segment and IDS was included in the Driveline segment.
The remaining businesses in the former other automotive reportable segment, emitec and Cylinder Liners, are no longer reportable and are included as reconciling items as other businesses.
Comparative information has been restated.
Driveline, aerospace and Land Systems are operating and reportable segments.
powder Metallurgy comprises GKN Sinter Metals and Hoeganaes Corporation.
