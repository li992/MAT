Retirement benefit obligations 8 the Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below.
Kier Group Pension Scheme this is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan.
the assets of the scheme are held under trust separately from those of the Group: the trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
the defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002: existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the trustees independent actuaries as at 1 July 2007 using the projected unit method.
the market value of the schemes assets at that date were 508.9m which represented approximately 87% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
the contributions paid during the year were 32.5m 2009: 20.2m which include special contributions of 21.2m 2009: 8.0m to fund the past service deficit.
An actuarial valuation is currently being undertaken by the trustees independent actuaries as at 1 April 2010 using the projected unit method.
it is not expected that the results of the valuation will be finalised until towards the end of the new financial year.
Going forward contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2007 valuation date until the 2010 valuation is finalised when a revised allowance will be included.
the Group expects to pay contributions for future service of 11.8m being 20.3% of pensionable pay plus 8.0m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2011. the pension protection Fund ppF levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group pension scheme.
the Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
the contributions paid during the year and the pension charge, amounted to 6.0m 2009: 5.8m.
Kier Sheffield LLP the Group participates in this defined benefit scheme through its subsidiary Kier sheffield llp which has participated as an admitted body in the south Yorkshire pension Fund since 1 April 2003.
As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with assets and ongoing past service liabilities of 65.0m.
the scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from sheffield councils employment to Kier sheffield llp upon the start of the contract.
new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group pension scheme.
Kier sheffield llp is required to pay contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier sheffield llps pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
the contributions paid during the year were 1.1m 2009: 1.1m.
Going forward Kier sheffield llp expects to pay contributions for future service at the rate of 11.5% of pensionable pay which the funds actuary has determined is sufficient to meet ongoing benefits.
Other schemes contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme, and in respect of employees who are members of a local government pension scheme.
the pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid during the year.

this amount has been included as a contribution received by the scheme.
the past service credit in the current year arose in the Kier sheffield llp pension scheme due to changes announced in the budget in June 2010 to use the cpi in place of the rpi to determine pension increases.
this has been accounted for as a change in benefits and recognised in the income statement as an exceptional item.
the potential effect of the change in the rpi to cpi on the Kier Group pension scheme is yet to be determined.
the credit on the benefit curtailment in the prior year arose in the Kier Group pension scheme as a consequence of the Boards decision to restrict pensionable salary increases to the lower of actual pay increases and the annual rate of increase in rpi.
the previous valuations were based on salaries increasing at 1.5% above the rate of increase in rpi.

if the rate change from 28% to 27% had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2010 it would have had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax asset of 21.5m Group 21.2m, joint ventures 0.3m held at this date by 1.4m, with 1.0m being credited to the income statement and 2.4m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
it has not been possible to quantify the full-anticipated effect of the announced further 3% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the deferred tax assets accordingly.
d Tax losses At the balance sheet date the Group has unused income tax losses of 2.5m 2009: 12.9m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of nil 2009: 10.0m of income losses.
no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset.
under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Vesting may be in full or in part with the balance of the award lapsing, and is subject to the Group achieving specific performance targets.
the awards which are taken as shares are intended to be satisfied from the following shares held by the Kier Group 1999 employee Benefit trust rather than from the issue of new shares.
these shares are accounted for as a deduction from retained earnings.
the dividends on these shares have been waived.
A description of these schemes and the terms and conditions of each scheme are included in the directors remuneration report on pages 57, 58 and 61.

Guarantees and contingent liabilities 24 there are contingent liabilities in respect of performance bonds, guarantees and claims under contracting and other arrangements, including joint arrangements and joint ventures, entered into in the normal course of business.
Financial instruments 25 Capital risk management the Group and company manage their capital to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
the capital structure of the Group and company comprises: equity attributable to equity holders of Kier Group plc, consisting of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 19. the Group and company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issue of new shares and issuing or repaying borrowings.
the Groups policy is to carry no significant debt, other than the non-recourse debt of joint ventures engaged in commercial property and pFi projects.
the Groups overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
in the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
the overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
the Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board.
treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts.
there is no Group-wide rate of provision, and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
92 Kier Group plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2010 Financial instruments continued 25 An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
2010 2009 m m provision as at 1 July 3.6 1.6 increase in provision during the year 4.2 2.5 provision utilised during the year provision released during the year 0.4 0.5 provision as at 30 June 7.4 3.6 there are 53.8m 2009: 43.8m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which 40.2m 2009: 32.2m had been received by the end of August 2010. there are no indications as at 30 June 2010 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and unprovided.
the proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2010 that were overdue for payment was 21% 2009: 20%.
credit terms vary across the Group: the average age of trade receivables was as follows: construction 50 days 2009: 41 days support services 29 days 2009: 26 days overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Market risk Interest rate risk the Group has hedged part of its exposure to interest rate movements through a private placement of 30.3m of loan notes for ten years from February 2003, which bear interest on a fixed rate basis at 6.4% p. a. the balance of the Groups borrowings are to finance short-term working capital requirements.
such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to liBor.
in addition, a number of the Groups pFi and developments joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk the Group operates primarily within the uK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk the Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
the Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities.
the quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Derivative financial instruments Current Non-current Total liabilities liabilities liabilities At 30 June 2010 m m m Fuel price forward contracts 0.2 0.1 0.3 Fuel price forward contracts have been accounted for as an ineffective cash flow hedge.
the fair value of these contracts have been determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are based on observable market data.
in addition to the above, a number of the Groups pFi joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without recourse to the Group.
At 30 June 2010 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 178.5m.
the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2010 based on quoted prices in active markets, amounted to 15.0m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of 4.2m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.
Kier Group plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2010 93 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Financial instruments continued 25 Financial assets analysis by currency and maturity dates At 30 June 2010 the Group had cash, and short-term deposits denominated in the following currencies: 2010 2009 m m Currency: sterling 200.1 117.2 us dollar 0.6 0.3 euro 1.2 0.3 other 3.6 4.9 total 205.5 122.7 Financial liabilities analysis of maturity dates At 30 June 2010 the Group had financial liabilities as detailed below together with the maturity profile of their contractual cash flows: Derivative Trade Long-term financial payables borrowings instruments Total m m m m 30 June 2010 carrying value 568.5 30.3 0.3 599.1 contractual cash flows less than one year 554.4 0.2 554.6 one to two years 9.9 0.1 10.0 two to three years 1.9 30.3 32.2 three to four years 1.8 1.8 Four to five years 0.8 0.8 More than five years 0.6 0.6 569.4 30.3 0.3 600.0 30 June 2009 carrying value 514.2 30.2 0.9 545.3 contractual cash flows less than one year 504.7 0.6 505.3 one to two years 9.5 0.3 9.8 three to four years 30.2 30.2 514.2 30.2 0.9 545.3 there is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of the Groups financial liabilities.
the carrying value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows.
the long-term borrowings represent a 17.0m uK sterling loan and a 13.4m us dollar loan, net of 0.1m of capitalised finance costs, from the private placement of loan notes made in February 2003. the loans are repayable in one payment in February 2013. the uK sterling loan is at a fixed interest rate of 6.4% for the term of the loan.
the Group has entered into interest payment and repayment swaps for the us dollar loan, which give an effective 6.4% fixed interest rate for the term of the loan.
