The decrease in income tax losses in the year of 5.8 million is explained by a foreign currency retranslation difference of 9.6 million on losses carried forward at 2009, net of an increase in losses carried forward of 3.8 million.
It is probable that future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.
Included in the losses are US income tax losses of USD 102 million 2009: USD 102 million which are unlikely to be available for use due to the change of ownership restrictions.

The remaining losses held in overseas entities may expire over periods of up to 20 years.
Following the recent introduction of a UK dividend exemption, there should be no deferred tax liability in respect of unremitted earnings other than where a withholding tax liability may arise on payment of a dividend.
The potential deferred tax liability in respect of this withholding tax is 6.9 million, but the Group is in a position to control the timing of the dividends, and therefore no liability has been recognised.
In the previous period, prior to the introduction of the UK dividend exemption, the unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of unremitted earnings of non-UK subsidiaries was 69.1 million.
5. earninGs per 0.10 ordinary share Earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

The geographical segment reporting format reflects the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement of segment results since the last annual financial statements.
Intra-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
No individual customer accounted for more than 10 per cent of revenue in any year reported in the consolidated financial statements.
The European and Asia Pacific and the Rest of the World segments generate revenue from the sale of Durex, Scholl footcare and Scholl footwear branded products, in addition to sales derived from locally-owned brands and the distribution of other consumer products.
The Americas segment derives sales from the sale of Durex branded products.
Details of the Groups product range are included in the business review on pages 13 to 16.
GeoGraphical seGments The Group is comprised of the following geographical segments: Europe includes acquired Russian and Ukrainian operations Americas Asia Pacific and Rest of the World Central costs relate entirely to the European segment, and are therefore included within the result for that segment.

The assets under construction at 31 March 2009 related to the factory under construction in China, and the expansion of the manufacturing facilities in Thailand.
As entities are transferred onto SAP, fully written down assets are removed from the system.

Risk adjusted pre-tax discount factors of 10.3-30.6 per cent 2009: 11.4-12 per cent have been applied to the projections.
The pre-tax discount rate has been based on managements calculation of the pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to calculate the cost of equity.
A range of alphas were used to reflect the risk of the different cash generating units.
The Directors do not believe that a reasonably possible change of assumptions would cause the recoverable amounts to fall below book value for any of the following material assets.
material assets Scholl brand The Scholl brand, with a carrying value of 61.2 million at 31 March 2010 2009: 61.4 million, is not amortised.
The brand has been tested for impairment using the method described below.
No charge for impairment was required in the year.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the Scholl brand, the Group is regarded as two cash generating units, that part relating to Schollbranded products and that relating to all other consumer products.
The Scholl brands recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the brand using the following key assumptions: cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results.
revenue growth was anticipated at 2 per cent 2009: 2 per cent per annum and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of eight years.
This is considered an appropriate medium-term assumption based on prior performance.
operating results were then held at the year nine figures into perpetuity reflecting the Directors assertion that the brand has an indefinite useful economic life based upon its proven value over long periods and its position in the market which is considered sustainable for the foreseeable future.
a pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor of 10.1 per cent 2009: 11.4 per cent was applied to the pre-tax cash flow projections.
For the Scholl brand to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 38.2 per cent before the brands value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 28.9 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 28.2 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.
goodwill ariSing on acquiSiTion oF qingdao london durex company limiTed china goodwill Goodwill denominated in Chinese Renminbi arose on the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited in January 2007.
The carrying value of the goodwill at 31 March 2010 is 25.2 million 2009: 26.4 million.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the China goodwill, the Chinese commercial business and manufacturing entities of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited and SSL Healthcare Shanghai Limited were identified as a single cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill using the following key assumptions: cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results.
revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent 2009: 3 per cent per annum, based on mediumto long-term forecasts, with operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of nine years.
This is in line with historical experience.
operating results were then held at the year 10 figures into perpetuity reflecting the expected maintenance of the position in the market.
a pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor of 11.5 per cent 2009: 12 per cent was applied to the projections.
For the China goodwill to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 71 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 27 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 3.3 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
vaSyli goodwill and inTangible aSSeTS The Vasyli business was acquired in November 2007, with goodwill of 12.8 million initially recognised on acquisition.
During the current and prior financial year, the Directors have reviewed the contingent consideration payable in the forthcoming year, as detailed in note 17, and consequently the goodwill relating to the Vasyli business was increased to 20.7 million at 31 March 2009 and 37.3 million at 31 March 2010.
The carrying value of the other intangible assets acquired as part of the Vasyli acquisition at 31 March 2010 is 2.7 million 2009: 3.1 million.
The useful economic lives attributed to the other intangible assets at recognition were 20 years for the brands and related intellectual property, and three to five years for customer relationships: no changes have been made to the estimated remaining useful economic lives since acquisition.
An impairment review has been performed at 31 March 2010 in relation to the revised goodwill of 37.3 million.
The Vasyli business, encompassing sales of the Orthaheel, Orthastyle, Vasyli and VAS brands across the Group, was identified as a single cash-generating unit.
cash flows for years two and three were based upon the business plan forecast operating results.
revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent 2009: 3 per cent per annum from year four to year 10, nil thereafter, and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue.
operating results were then held at the year 10 figures for a further 10 years reflecting the current expected useful life of the goodwill and related brands and the longer-term strategic benefit of the integration of the Vasyli business with that of Scholl footcare.
a pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor of 11.7 per cent 2009: 11.8 per cent was applied to the projections.
For the Vasyli goodwill to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 19.7 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing all revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 10.1 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 1.8 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
conTex ruSSia brand, medcom ruSSia goodwill and oTher inTangible aSSeTS The Medcom Russia business was acquired in June 2009 as detailed in note 9 : the individually material assets recognised at acquisition were the Contex brand valued at 126.6 million and goodwill of 27.6 million.
These assets are denominated in Russian Roubles, and at 31 March closing exchange rates, were valued at 140.9 million and 30.8 million respectively.
The carrying value of the other intangible assets acquired as part of the Medcom Russia acquisition at 31 March 2010 is 9.6 million.
The useful economic lives attributed to the other intangible assets at recognition were 10 years for the brands and related intellectual property, and six years for customer relationships: no changes have been made to the estimated remaining useful economic lives since acquisition.
An impairment review has been performed at 31 March 2010 in relation to the Contex Russia brand and Medcom Russia goodwill of 140.9 million and 30.6 million.
The cash flows of the Medcom Russia business were separated into two cash-generating units: the first encompassing cash flows generated from the sale of Contex-branded condoms and lubricants within Russia and the CIS states, and the second including cash flows generated by the sale of all other consumer and medical goods across Russia and the CIS states.
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the Contex brand and goodwill using the following key assumptions: cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results.
revenue growth was anticipated at 13 per cent from year two, to 7 per cent in perpetuity in line with inflation assumptions for the region.
operating results were held at a constant percentage of revenue.
results into perpetuity were then calculated based on the operating results for year ten, reflecting the expected indefinite useful economic life of the goodwill and Contex brand, and the longer-term strategic benefit of the integration of the Medcom business with that of the Group.
a pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor of 21.9 per cent was applied to the projections.

Removing all revenue growth from the cash flow projections would decrease the valuation by 69.5 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 9.0 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
For the Contex Russia brand to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 24.8 per cent before the value-in-use calculation showed any impairment.
Reducing revenue growth by one per cent would decrease the valuation by 11.9 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 4.3 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
conTex ukraine brand, medcom ukraine goodwill and oTher inTangible aSSeTS The Medcom Ukraine business was acquired in October 2009 as detailed in note 9 : the individually material assets recognised at acquisition were the Contex brand, valued at 10.2 million, and goodwill of 10.1 million.
These assets are denominated in Ukrainian Hryvnia and at 31 March 2010 closing exchange rates, were valued at 11.2 million and 11.1 million respectively.
The carrying value of the other intangible assets acquired as part of the Medcom Ukraine acquisition at 31 March 2010 is 1.4 million 2009: nil.
The useful economic lives attributed to the other intangible assets at recognition were 10 years for the brands and related intellectual property, and 2.5 years for customer relationships: no changes have been made to the estimated remaining useful economic lives since acquisition.
An impairment review has been performed at 31 March 2010 in relation to the Contex Ukraine brand and Medcom Ukraine goodwill of 11.2 million and 11.1million.
The cash flows of the Medcom Ukraine business were separated into two cash-generating units: the first encompassing cash flows generated from the sale of Contex-branded condoms and lubricants within Ukraine, and the second including cash flows generated by the sale of all other consumer and medical goods in Ukraine.
revenue growth was anticipated at 15.5 per cent from year two and 5 per cent in perpetuity, in line with inflation assumptions for the region.
results into perpetuity were then calculated based on the operating results for year 10, reflecting the expected indefinite useful economic life of the goodwill and Contex brand, and the longer-term strategic benefit of the integration of the Medcom Ukraine business with that of the Group.
a pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor of 30.6 per cent was applied to the projections.
For the Medcom Ukraine goodwill to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 32.6 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Reducing all revenue growth by one per cent would decrease the valuation by 0.5 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 0.5 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
For the Contex Ukraine brand to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 48.4 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing all revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 5.4 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
9. acquisition of suBsidiaries  lemore Bv BlBv On 1 June 2009, the Group fulfilled its intention to increase its investment in the issued share capital of  Lemore BV BLBV from 15.5 per cent to 50 per cent plus one share, thereby securing control of the company.
The cash consideration was 60.2 million.
On 12 February 2010, the Group exercised an option, conditional upon the approval of SSLs shareholders, to increase its stake in BLBV to 75.3 per cent, and has a further option, exercisable in 2011, to take the Group shareholding in BLBV to 100 per cent.
BLBV is the Parent Company of a group of companies involved in the sale and distribution of consumer and medical products across Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States CIS.
Approval for the increase in the stake was received post year-end see note 26.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of BLBV were as follows: Book value of IFRS adjustments fair value assets acquired and accounting Fair value of assets Russian GAAP policy alignment adjustments acquired m m m m Contex brand 126.6 126.6 Other brands 6.9 6.9 Customer relationships 2.7 2.7 Other intangible assets 0.1 0.9 0.6 0.4 Property, plant and equipment 2.1 0.1 2.2 Inventory 23.6 0.4 1.0 23.0 Trade and other receivables 21.0 1.9 1.1 18.0 Cash 1.5 1.5 Trade and other payables 18.2 1.7 1.1 21.0 Loans 2.9 2.9 Deferred tax asset provision 0.1 0.5 27.2 26.6 27.3 1.7 105.2 130.8 Minority interest 64.7 Goodwill 27.6 Total consideration 93.7 Satisfied by: Cash 85.7 Direct costs associated with acquisition 8.0 93.7 Total consideration 93.7 Costs incurred in year ended 31 March 2009 in relation to the acquisition of the 15.5 per cent interest note 10 30.7 Addition during year ended 31 March 2010 63.0 Cash acquired with subsidiary 1.5 Net adjustment for closing accruals at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2010 0.5 net cash outflow on BlBv during the year ended 31 march 2010 62.0 Net cash outflow on Gainbridge during the year ended 31 March 2010 18.3 net cash outflow on acquisitions of subsidiaries during the year ended 31 march 2010 80.3 Of the cash consideration and direct costs noted above, 62.0 million related to cash outflows during the year ended 31 March 2010: in the consolidated statement of cash flows, this figure is presented net of cash acquired with the subsidiary of 1.5 million.
A further 30.7 million related to costs incurred in the year ended 31 March 2009 in relation to the acquisition of the 15.5 per cent interest.
Negligible intangible assets were included in the underlying records of BLBV, or its main trading subsidiary, Medcom MP.
On acquisition, the Group identified the following intangible assets: Contex brand and related trademarks: this is the market-leading brand of condoms and lubricants in Russia, and was one of the primary reasons for the acquisition of BLBV.
The Contex brand is considered to have an indefinite economic life, and has been valued using the excess earnings method at RUB 6,287 million 126.6 million.
Rouble-denominated cash flows have been based upon local management forecasts for the first five years, with future sales growth rates incorporating Russian inflation expectations, ranging from 23 per cent in the first year post-acquisition to 7 per cent in perpetuity.
The discount rate of 18.7 per cent has been adjusted for risk factors specific to Russia and Medcom.
Capital asset charges have been applied using risk-adjusted weighted average costs of capital in respect of fixed assets, working capital and the local workforce.
Other brands: additional brands, relating to condoms, pregnancy testing kits, plasters and medical gloves have been valued at RUB 342 million 6.9 million using the relief from royalty method.
Royalty rates of between 2.5 per cent and 7 per cent have been used in the valuations, dependent upon the relative strength of the brands, and a discount rate of 20.2 per cent has been applied to the expected royalty savings.
The brands have been assessed as having remaining useful economic lives of 10 years, with future growth rates incorporating Russian inflation, ranging from 13 per cent in the first year post-acquisition to 7 per cent after year five.
Customer relationships customer relationships totalling RUB 133 million 2.7 million have been recognised with regards to existing customer lists and contracts.
The customers were separated into two groups sharing similar characteristics, namely consumer and medical, with cash flows forecast over a period of six years, representing the expected useful life of the relationships.
The rouble-denominated cash flows were based upon local management forecasts: sales growth assumptions incorporate Russian inflation expectations, ranging from 13 per cent in the first year post-acquisition to 7 per cent in year six.
A discount rate of 21.7 per cent was applied.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of BLBV is attributed to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Groups existing products, for example, the Durex and Scholl footcare portfolios in the Russia and CIS markets and distribution channels, and the anticipated future manufacturing synergies arising from the combination.

A deferred tax liability was also recognised in respect of the temporary timing differences created by the fair value adjustments.
Given the short time frame between the intial and subsequent investments, and the fact that there was no significant change to the business during this period, the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired between the two dates are consistent.
BLBV contributed 115.9 million revenue and 28.6 million to the Groups profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and 31 March 2010.
It is not practicable to disclose what the contribution to Group revenue and profits would have been had the acquisition of BLBV been completed on the first day of the current period, as consoldiated financial information was not prepared on an IFRS basis prior to 1 June 2009.
GainBridGe investments cyprus limited GainBridGe On 1 October 2009, the Group completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the shares of Gainbridge from CCD Estate, for cash consideration of 20.6 million 18.7 million, at which point control of the group was deemed to pass to SSL International plc.

Negligible intangible assets were included in the underlying records of Gainbridge or its main trading subsidiary, Medcom MP Ukraine.
On acquisition, the Group identified the following intangible assets: Contex brand and related trademarks: this is the market-leading brand of condoms and lubricants in Ukraine and was one of the primary reasons for the acquisition of Gainbridge.
The Contex brand is considered to have an indefinite economic life, and has been valued using the excess earnings method at UAH 134 million 10.2 million.
Hryvnia-denominated cash flows have been based upon local management forecasts for the first five years, with future sales growth rates incorporating Ukrainian inflation expectations, ranging from 23 per cent in the first year post-acquisition to 5 per cent in perpetuity.
The discount rate of 24 per cent has been adjusted for risk factors specific to Ukraine and Medcom.
Other brands: additional brands, relating to condoms, pregnancy testing kits and plasters have been valued at UAH 13.8 million 1.0 million using the relief from royalty method.
Royalty rates of 7 per cent have been used in the valuations, and a discount rate of 25.5 per cent has been applied to the expected royalty savings.
The brands have been assessed as having remaining useful economic lives of 10 years, with future growth rates incorporating Ukrainian inflation, ranging from 13 per cent in the first year post-acquisition to 7 per cent after year five.
Customer  relationships totalling UAH 2.6 million 0.2 million have been recognised with regards to existing customer lists and contracts.
The customers were separated into two groups sharing similar characteristics, namely consumer and medical, with cash flows forecast over a period of 2.5 years, representing the expected useful life of the relationships.
The hryvnia-denominated cash flows were based upon local management forecasts: sales growth assumptions incorporate Ukraine inflation expectations, ranging from 23 per cent in the first year post-acquisition to 13 per cent in year two.
A discount rate of 27 per cent was applied.

Stirus Global Solutions Limited is an unquoted entity, therefore fair value of the shareholding cannot be readily ascertained: the investment is therefore held at initial cost and subject to annual impairment review.
An impairment charge of 1.0 million was recorded in the year ended 31 March 2010 in relation to this investment.
On 19 May 2008 the Group completed the first stage of its investment in  Lemore BV, BLBV, acquiring a 15.5 per cent stake for 24.6 million, plus acquisition costs of 6.1 million, with the ability to purchase the remainder exercisable over the next two years.
The investment was classed as a financial asset available for sale and was held at fair value at 31 March 2009.
At that date, the Directors concluded that it was not appropriate to account for the investment in BLBV as an associate because the Group held less than 20 per cent of the voting power, and the options to purchase the remainder of BLBV were not exercisable at the balance sheet date: it was concluded that the Group did not exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policy decisions of BLBV.
On 1 June 2009, the Group completed the second stage of its investment and gained control of BLBV as detailed in note 9: from this date, the results of BLBV have been included in the Group results, therefore the investment has been replaced wiht the results of the business in the financial statements.

The principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
Overdrafts and facilities of 9.0 million 2009: 13.5 millon are unsecured.
The average effective interest rate on bank overdraft approximates 2.25 per cent 2009: 1.25 per cent per annum.
The Group has the following bank facilities: A syndicated Group facility of 410.0 million available until June 2013, of which 108.9 million 2009: 137.4 million had been drawn down at 31 March 2010.
Drawdowns can be made for periods of one, two, three or six months, or any other mutually-agreed term: interest rates are set at the corresponding LIBOR plus 215 basis points at the time of the drawdown.
The individual drawdowns under the Group facility at 31 March 2010 all had repayment dates in April 2010: the drawdowns under the Group facility at 31 March 2009 all had repayment dates in April 2009.
At 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, the Group had the ability to roll-over these drawdowns, and expected that they all would be rolled over for at least 12 months, therefore the borrowings under the facility were classed as non-current.
At 31 March 2009, SSL Healthcare Italia SpA had fixed rate unsecured loans of 10.2 million: as there was no committed facility, the loans were disclosed within current liabilities.
Various overdraft facilities exist across the Group, including a UK facility of 7.5 million 2009: 7.5 million net.
undrawn BorrowinG facilities At 31 March 2010, the Group had available 301.1 million 2009: 82.6 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.

The 60.0 million drawdowns on the Group facility designated as part of the cash flow hedge relationship are for periods of one month, repayable in April 2010, and therefore are held at notional value which is deemed equivalent to fair value.
The interest rate swaps are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value totalling 0.8 million 2009: 3.2 million have been charged directly to equity in relation to fair value movements in the interest rate swaps during the year ended 31 March 2010.
Changes in fair value of 2.7 million 2009: 0.1 million previously charged credited directly to equity have been recycled through profit and loss in the current year.
The cash flow hedge was 100 per cent effective in the current and prior year.
Bank loans held as a net investment hedGe The Japanese Yen drawdown on the Group Facility of 6.5 million 2009: 6.5 million is designated as a net investment hedge of the Groups investment in subsidiaries denominated in Japanese Yen.
As explained in note 20, the net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective in the current and prior year.
oBliGations under finance leases Finance lease liabilities are secured on the assets to which they relate.
The average lease term outstanding is one year.
For the year ended 31 March 2010, the average effective borrowing rate was 8.6 per cent 2009: 6.7 per cent.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
The lease obligations are denominated in Thai Baht, and the fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying value.

These payments are based on service and are payable to employees and agents upon termination of services for the Group, regardless of the reason for such termination.
The terms of the payments vary by territory and include, for example, average salary over the service life of the employee or the final salary of the employee, or payment required under collective agreements to sales agents upon termination of their contracts by the Group.
The main assumptions underlying the calculation on a weighted average basis across the various schemes are salary increases of 1 per cent, an inflation rate of 2 per cent and a discount rate of 5.3 per cent.
The calculation of the provision is determined by contractual obligation and therefore can be estimated reliably.
No terminations are expected in the forthcoming year.
euroPean suPPly chain restructuring During the year ended 31 March 2008, as part of the European supply chain restructuring programme, provisions of 41.3 million were made in relation to the closure of the manufacturing facilities at Rubi Spain and Guernsey, the closure of the Technical Services Centre in Cambridge, and the restructuring of the Footwear Development Group.
Operations in Spain and Cambridge had ceased by 31 March 2008: operations in Guernsey ceased, and substantially all of the remaining European supply chain restructuring activities were completed, during the previous financial year.
During the year ended 31 March 2010, the surplus property at Guernsey has been disposed of.
The remaining elements of the restructuring programme to be completed are the final integration and validation of plant transferred from Guernsey to Peterlee, and the disposal of the surplus property in Rubi.
The key remaining uncertainties at the balance sheet date were in relation to the disposal of this property, for example whether the property will be sold or sub-let, the potential proceeds receivable under either alternative, and the time period in which the disposal will be completed.
It is anticipated that all of the remaining European supply chain restructuring provision will be utilised within the forthcoming year, subject to property transactions being completed.
other Other provisions relate to a number of pre-merger environmental provisions of 1.6 million and surplus property provisions of 3.6 million.
Environmental provisions are provided for to the extent that a present obligation exists, it is probable such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably.
No provision is made for possible additional costs that are not currently probable.
The surplus property provision relates to Group commitments under non-cancellable leases which, following historical restructuring exercises, are no longer used by the Group.
The obligation, net of expected rental income, has been provided for.
Surplus property and environmental costs of 4.1 million have been included as non-current.
It is expected that all other provisions will be utilised during the next financial year.
contingent consideration Contingent consideration of 25.5 million 2009: 9.4 million relates to the acquisition of the Vasyli business during the year ended 31 March 2008.
The consideration is contingent upon the level of Orthaheel-branded sales achieved across the Group in the 15 months-ended 30 June 2010, and is capped at 25.5 million.
The estimated liability recognised within provisions during the year ended 31 March 2010 reflects the amount which is considered probable to be paid based on actual sales for 2009 10 and detailed budgets for the three months to 30 June 2010.
This estimate has been increased by 16.6 million during the year after sales of Orthaheel-branded products exceeded budgeted levels in the period to 31 March 2010.
Post-retirement benefits The Group continues to operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans in the UK and overseas.
All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants and no further benefits are accruing.

It also operates defined contribution executive pension plans for senior executives.
Employer contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of UK defined contribution schemes was 1.5 million 2009: 1.5 million.
b defined benefit schemes The Group continues to operate a number of defined benefit schemes following the mergers of Seton Healthcare Group plc and Scholl PLC to form Seton Scholl in 1998, and the subsequent merger of Seton Scholl and LIG in 1999.
All UK schemes have been closed to new entrants and no further benefits are accruing.
Benefits for members who are still employed by the Group remain linked to their final earnings.

Post-retirement benefits CONTINUED overseas Pensions and similar obligations The Group has a number of pension schemes in different countries, both defined benefit and defined contribution.
Defined benefit schemes are set up under separate trust funds and liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of overseas defined contribution schemes was 5.9 million 2009: 2.4 million.
Details of the material overseas defined benefit schemes are included below.
The most recent actuarial valuations for each scheme were updated for IAS 19 purposes to 31 March 2010 by independent qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions used by the actuaries in determining the present value of the liabilities were: seton scholl lig overseas 2010 Rate of increase in salaries 4.7% 4.7% 4.7% 3.0% Pensions increases per annum 3.6% 1.5% Pensions accrued to 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.0% Open section 2.2% Pensions accrued from 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.8% Open section 3.6% Pre April 1997 1.8% Post April 1997 3.6% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.5% 5.5% 5.5% 5.3% Inflation assumption 3.7% 3.7% 3.7% 2.3% 2009 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 3.0% Pensions increases per annum 2.9% 1.9% Pensions accrued to 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.0% Open section 1.5% Pensions accrued from 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.4% Open section 2.9% Pre April 1997 1.5% Post April 1997 2.9% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.9% 6.9% 6.9% 6.7% Inflation assumption 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 2.6% For the UK schemes, the mortality assumption was updated at 31 March 2009 to include a minimum underpin for future improvements in mortality of 1.0 per cent per annum for males and 0.5 per cent per annum for females.
The assumed life expectancy for a 65 year old male retiring in the current period is 21 years 2009: 20.7 years and for a male retiring in 20 years at age 65, life expectancy is 22.9 years 2009: 22.6 years.
The assumed life expectancy for a 65 year old female retiring in the current period is 22.4 years 2009: 23.2 years and for a female retiring in 20 years at age 65, life expectancy is 23.6 years 2009: 24.4 years.
The expected rate of return on pension scheme assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long-term returns of the major asset classes in which the schemes invest equities, corporate bonds, and government bonds for the UK schemes, and insurance contracts for the overseas schemes weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
Based on the assumptions made and the distribution of assets, the weighted average expected return on assets as at 31 March 2010 is 6.6 per cent 31 March 2009: 6.4 per cent.
These rates are net of an allowance for investment management expenses.
An allowance for administrative expenses is included in the present value of scheme liabilities.

19,190,000 new ordinary shares of 10 pence were placed with institutions at a price of 4.55 per share on 28 January 2009, generating gross proceeds of 87.3 million 84.3 million net of financing costs, some of which had been accrued but not paid at 31 March 2009.
The share placing was enacted via the use of a new subsidiary Company, SSL Capital Limited, registered in Jersey: the institutions subscribed for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary shares and 100 per cent of preference shares in the subsidiary, which were subsequently exchanged for an allotment of the newly issued shares in SSL International plc.
Shares issued under employee share options generated proceeds of 2.3 million 2009: 1.1 million.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
Details of the share option schemes in place are included in note 19. share Premium and merger reserve The share premium account and the merger reserve are non-distributable.
The increase in the merger reserve of 82.4 million during the year ended 31 March 2009 arose from accounting for the share-for-share exchange in which SSL International plc issued new ordinary shares in exchange for the remaining ordinary and preference shares in SSL Capital Limited.
cumulative foreign exchange reserve The cumulative foreign exchange reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
During the year, foreign exchange losses of nil 2009: losses of 1.8 million on foreign currency borrowings were offset by gains of nil 2009: gains of 1.8 million arising from retranslation of foreign assets, designated as the hedging instrument.
The net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective in the current and prior year.
cash flow hedge reserve The cash flow hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate borrowings transferred to the reserve during the current and previous financial year.
caPital management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 16, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed above.
The Group manages its capital structure through maintaining close relationships with its bankers who provide the majority of funds used for operational requirements.
The key indicator of capital management performance used by internal management is the level of net debt, which is defined as financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt is monitored on a monthly basis to ensure that actual results are in line with net debt forecasts.
The Groups main banking facility is a syndicated Group facility of 410.0 million.
This facility was arranged in December 2009 and is committed until June 2013.
The banking syndicate comprises ten members and is administered by Barclays Bank plc.
Further information in relation to the Groups financial liabilities is given in notes 16 and 22.
A reconciliation of movements in net debt is provided in note 22.
Net debt at 31 March 2010 is 41.1 million compared with 17.7 million at 31 March 2009.
The Group is required to maintain covenant ratios in respect of net debt to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA and net interest costs to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
A further covenant requires subsidiaries accounting for 70 per cent of the unconsolidated assets of the Group to be guarantors.
The Group has met its covenant ratios for the year ended 31 March 2010.
The Group has prepared forecasts of the cash flows for the next 18 months which indicate that the Group, after considering all known commitments and appropriate sensitivities, will meet its covenant requirements for this period.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group has the authority to purchase its own shares on the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Groups share option and performance share plans.
No such purchases were made during the current or previous financial year.
Decisions to purchase shares are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board: there is no defined share buy-back plan.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

92 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS annual rePort and accounts 2010 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23. financial risK management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit: liquidity: interest rate: and currency.
Further information on the Groups exposure to these risks is presented below, with an explanation of the Groups policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and review of the Groups risk management policies and procedures: these guidelines are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, including setting and monitoring compliance with appropriate limits and controls.
The policies are reviewed regularly and amended where appropriate to reflect changes in the Groups operations, risk exposure and market conditions.
The Board is assisted by the Groups Business Assurance function, which undertakes regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Groups Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group.
credit risK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups trade receivables and investment securities.
trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer: the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, approximately 80 per cent of the Groups debtors are in Europe.
Group exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy, which is reviewed annually, for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, reviewing credit ratings, and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
Customer credit risk is monitored at a subsidiary level by divisional management, and is reviewed at Group level by country.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payments statistics for similar financial assets.
investment securities Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded derivatives.
The Group deposits central funds, when available, with highly rated banks, in line with Group policy.
The central funds on deposit at the balance sheet date were 20.4 million 2009: 104.5 million.
Guarantees The Groups policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2010, no guarantees were outstanding 2009: none.
liquidity risK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risks by ensuring that any anticipated funding requirements, based on detailed cash flow forecasts at subsidiary and Group level, will be met by access to different sources of funding.
Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 30-60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations.
In addition, the Group maintains the credit facilities detailed in note 16.
Committed undrawn facilities available to the Group in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2010 2009 m m Expiring in one year or less Expiring in more than one year and less than two years Expiring in more than two years 301.1 82.6 total 301.1 82.6 marKet risK Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, would affect the Groups income, the value of its holdings of financial instruments, or its obligations in respect of retirement benefits.
foreiGn currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Groups entities.
Where practicable, the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge major transactional exposures on working capital balances.
At the start of each financial year, the Group hedges approximately 50 to 70 per cent of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast sales and purchases over the forthcoming financial year.
Interest on borrowings is primarily denominated in Sterling, such that no related foreign currency derivatives are required.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Groups investment in its Japanese subsidiary is hedged by a Japanese Yen-denominated secured bank loan which mitiages the currency risk arising from the subsidiarys net assets.
interest rate risk The Groups variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates over the longer term: the Group has reduced its exposure to this by entering into interest rate swaps over 60.0 million of the drawndown facility.
The remaining drawndown facility of 48.9 million was at LIBOR plus 215 basis points at 31 March 2010 with all contracts ending in April 2010.
Interest rates will be reset for each tranche on the amounts redrawn in April 2010. other market price risk The Group does not speculate in equity securities, nor does the Group enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage requirements.
The Group held a strategic investment of 1.0 million in the equity securities of an unlisted company at 31 March 2009, as detailed in note 10: this is not deemed to expose the Group to market price risk, although the investment is subject to annual impairment reviews and a 1.0 million impairment provision has been recorded during the year ended 31 March 2010. exPosure to credit risK The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: carrying amount Carrying amount 2010 2009 m m Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and derivative financial assets 221.7 194.9 Available for sale financial assets 31.7 Cash and cash equivalents 74.5 147.9 Other forward exchange contracts 0.1 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: carrying amount Carrying amount 2010 2009 m m United Kingdom 24.9 28.0 Europe 143.1 118.4 Asia Pacific and Rest of the World 37.5 31.9 Americas 5.3 5.6 210.8 183.9 94 95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS annual rePort and accounts 2010 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23. financial risK management CONTINUED The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: allowance for Allowance for gross impairment Gross impairment 2010 2010 2009 2009 m m m m Trade receivables due within terms 210.8 186.7 Past due by less than 30 days 10.2 8.3 Past due 31-120 days 9.9 8.0 Past due 120-365 days 6.0 3.6 4.4 3.0 More than one year 5.1 5.1 4.1 4.1 242.0 8.7 211.5 7.1 Provision for rebates 22.5 20.5 Gross trade receivables note 11 219.5 191.0 Allowance for impairment 8.7 7.1 Net credit exposure 210.8 183.9 There are no customers representing more than 2.0 per cent 2009: 3.3 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for impairment.
Movement on the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables is disclosed in note 12.
The allowance for impairment has been determined based on historical trends, and relevant market and customer information.
The Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
All receivables classified as non-current are within the respective payment contractual terms.

At 31 March 2010, the carrying amount for secured bank loans of 104.4 million 2009: 137.4 million relates to drawdowns under the syndicated Group facility.
As explained in note 16, the contractual repayment dates of each drawdown, along with accumulated interest, were in April 2010 2009: repayment dates were in April 2009 : however, at the balance sheet date, it was expected that all of these drawdowns would be rolled over for at least 12 months, and therefore classification as non-current liabilities at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009 was concluded to be appropriate.
Within the table above, 0.2 million 2009: 0.2 million of contractual cash flows relating to the interest to be paid on maturity in April 2010 2009: April 2009 have been included within the category six months or less.
The contractual cash flows relating to the underlying drawdowns of 108.9 million 2009: 137.4 million have been included in the category two to five years, the period in which the Group facility expires.
The interest rate swaps used for hedging at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009 are designated in a cash flow hedge relationship against 60.0 million of the secured bank loans, and therefore the related cash flows will not impact upon profit or loss until the hedge relationship ceases.
currency risK exposure to currency risk The Groups main exposure to foreign currency risk was in respect of the Euro, based on notional amounts: 2010 2009 exposure Exposure to euro risk to Euro risk m m Trade receivables 113.9 111.3 Prepayments and other receivables 4.2 3.9 Trade payables 35.3 45.5 Other payables 28.2 23.9 Gross balance sheet exposure 54.6 45.8 Net exposure to currency risk with regards to other foreign currencies was not significant at 31 March 2010 or 31 March 2009.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: average rate for the year balance sheet date 2010 2009 2010 2009 Euro 1.1289 1.2041 1.1211 1.0796 sensitivity analysis A 10 per cent strengthening of sterling against the Euro at 31 March would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
2010 2009 Profit Profit equity or loss Equity or loss Euro 8.6 5.5 1.0 4.1 A 10 per cent weakening of sterling against the Euro at 31 March would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
interest rate risK cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Due to the short maturity dates of the drawdowns on the Group facility at 31 March 2010 average maturity 22 days and 31 March 2009 average maturity 18 days, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at either reporting date would have negligible impact on the carrying value of variable rate financial instruments, and similarly upon profit or loss.
The interest rate swaps at 31 March 2010 and also at 31 March 2009 are included as part of a cash flow hedge relationship, therefore any change in interest rates at the reporting date would have no impact upon profit or loss for the year, only upon the amount recognised in equity within the cash flow hedge reserve and the carrying value of derivative financial liabilities on the balance sheet.

available for sale financial assets The available for sale financial assets at 31 March 2009 related to unquoted entities, therefore fair value of the shareholding could not be readily ascertained.
Both investments were therefore held at initial cost, which is deemed to be comparable to fair value, although the investments are subject to annual impairment review.
derivatives The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for ther residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate based on government bonds.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes.
Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
In respect of finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
The carrying values of all borrowings are equal to the fair values due to the relatively short contractual maturity dates.
trade and other receivables The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices, or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

These are placed on terms not exceeding three months.
financial liabilities The Groups fixed rate financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups variable rate financial derivatives and variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates.
hedging At 31 March 2010, the Group had interest rate and currency swaps with a notional amount of 239.5 million 2009: 122.4 million.
Interest rate swaps including those in effective fair value hedging relationships are measured at fair value under IAS 39.
The fair value of interest and currency swaps recognised as hedges at 31 March 2010 is a net liability of 2.1 million comprising liabilities of 2.1 million 2009: net liability of 4.0 million comprising liabilities of 4.0 million.
The maturity dates of all financial liabilities, together with details of their fair values and carrying values are disclosed in note 16.
