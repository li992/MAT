As noted in the OFR on pages 10 to 24, the Aerospace Division consists of 15 operations and the Flexonics Division consists of 11 operations.
Each of these operations is considered to be a separate CGU.
Goodwill has been allocated to 15 of these individual CGUs 10 in Aerospace and five in Flexonics.
The table below highlights the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGUs that are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
Where the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is individually not considered significant, it is aggregated in the table below.
The carrying amount of goodwill of the aggregated Aerospace CGUs is considered significant and the recoverable amounts for these units are based principally on the same key assumptions.

The 2010 goodwill impairment review was undertaken as at 31 December 2010.
The recoverable amounts of all the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The calculations for all the CGUs use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts per individual unit, as approved by management for the next three years: a detailed budget covers the next financial year which is supplemented by forecasts of performance for the two years after that.
These forecasts, where appropriate, take account of the current economic environment as set out in the OFR on pages 10 to 24.
Cash flows thereafter have been extrapolated based on estimated growth rates.
These growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the relevant markets.
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU have also been adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 10.4% 2009 10.6%.
This is based on the Groups weighted average pre-tax cost of capital and is the measurement used by management in assessing investment appraisals.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 65 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 13.
Goodwill continued The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for all Aerospace CGUs are the forecast build rates for aircraft, forecast gross margins and long-term average growth rates.
Forecast build rates for aircraft are in line with market forecasts and guidance available from manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus.
Forecast gross margins are set individually by each CGU and reflect past experience, notably the most recently achieved margins, but also factor in continuing efficiency improvements to counteract inflationary increases in underlying costs.
Cash flows extrapolated beyond the initial forecast period of three years are based on growth rates of 2.5% per annum which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate forecasts for the aerospace market as included in market outlooks from Boeing and Airbus.
As noted in the OFR on pages 10 to 24, aircraft deliveries in the business jet market declined 12% in the year, adversely impacting profitability in the Aerospace Division.
This decline had a similar impact at Capo Industries, which operates mainly in the business jet market.
Taking this into consideration, projections for Capo Industries for the initial forecast period have been expanded a further three years beyond the initial forecast period of three years to reflect the medium-term plan of management to recover from this downturn in the market.
Beyond this combined six-year period, cash flows are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% from 2017 to 2029, in line with Boeing and Bombardier 20-year market projections, and 2.5% per annum thereafter as noted above.
This results in Capo Industries carrying value exceeding its recoverable amount by 8.7m, before recognition of an impairment loss.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of AMT, Jet Products, Sterling Machine, BWT, Bird Bellows and all other aggregated Aerospace CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount of those units and aggregated units, respectively.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for Pathway which includes WahlcoMetroflex are the forecast orders and forecast gross margins.
Forecast orders are based on the orders secured and quote activity at the time of setting the budget, and also reflect past experience with the build-up of orders and quote success rates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, notably the most recently achieved margins, but also factor in expected efficiency improvements to counteract inflationary increases in underlying costs.
They are also adjusted to incorporate anticipated savings from headcount reductions and other cost control measures to be implemented in light of the current economic environment.
Cash flows extrapolated beyond the initial forecast period of three years are based on growth rates of 1% per annum which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate forecasts for power generation and energy markets as noted by the International Energy Agency.
Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which Pathways recoverable amount is based would not cause Pathways carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
No significant goodwill is associated with CGUs operating in land vehicle markets.
At 31 December 2010, before impairment testing, goodwill of 37.5m was allocated to Capo Industries, within Aerospace.
As noted above, and in the OFR on pages 10 to 24, Capo Industries operates mainly in the business jet market and the decline in this market since 2008, coupled with few signs of market improvement, has led to a reduction in its recoverable amount based on value in use calculated per the methodology noted above.
This has led to the recognition of an impairment loss against goodwill of 8.7m, which is included within trading profit in the Consolidated Income Statement.
No impairment charges were recognised in 2009.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
There are no other credit or impairment losses for other classes of financial assets.
Further disclosures on credit risk are included in Note 21.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 69 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Trade and Other Receivables continued The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 54 days.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 1.3m 2009 2.3m.
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision risk in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
For the Company, the carrying amount of amounts due from subsidiaries approximates their fair value.

The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings to be as follows: Group Group Company Company Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Bank overdrafts 0.1 1.1 Bank loans 4.5 Other loans 132.1 120.3 131.4 119.4 132.2 125.9 131.4 119.4 The fair value of Other loans has been determined by applying a make-whole calculation using the prevailing treasury bill yields plus the applicable credit spread for the Group.
The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The effective interest rates on bank overdrafts are determined based on appropriate LIBOR rates plus applicable margin.
The Groups and the Companys main loans are unsecured guaranteed loan notes in the US private placement market and revolving credit facilities.
Notes of $25m carry interest at the rate of 6.42% and are due for repayment in October 2015.
Notes of $75m carry interest at the rate of 6.84% and are due for repayment in October 2018.
Notes of $20m carry interest at the rate of 6.94% and are due for repayment in October 2020. b Loan notes of $30m, 2010 19.1m 2009 18.6m were taken out in January 2007 and are due for repayment in January 2017.

The Group also has two revolving credit facilities: a committed 80m syndicated multi-currency facility maturing in July 2012 and a committed $20m single bank 12.7m facility maturing in August 2011.
There were no amounts drawn under the first facility by either the Group or the Company at 31 December 2010.
As at 31 December 2009, 4.5m was drawn by the Group under the first facility, comprising 5.0m.
No amounts were drawn by the Company at 31 December 2009.
There were no amounts drawn under the second facility as at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group had available 92.7m 2009 87.9m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.

Financial Instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the balance between debt and equity.
In considering the appropriate level of net debt the Group pays close attention to its level as compared to the cash generation potential of the Group, measured by adjusted profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group also monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as the total of bank and other loans, obligations under finance leases, forward exchange contract losses less cash and cash equivalents and forward exchange contract gains.
Total capital is the equity shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
All of the Groups external borrowing facilities have a requirement for the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be less than 3.0x.
Internally the Group aims for this ratio to not exceed 2.5x.
At 31 December 2010 net debt was 0.7x the Groups level of EBITDA 31 December 2009 1.3x.
In addition, all borrowing facilities contain the requirement for EBITDA interest cover the number of times net interest is covered by the Groups EBITDA to be in excess of 3.5x.
At 31 December 2010 EBITDA was 11.8x the level of net interest 31 December 2009 10.6x.
Therefore, the Group currently has considerable funding headroom.
The Groups strategy in respect of gearing is to target a long-term gearing ratio within the range of 60% to 80%.
Ratios outside this range may still be considered to be acceptable, in certain circumstances.
The gearing ratio for the Group at the end of 2010 was 28% 2009 55%.
The decrease in 2010 is attributable mainly to the strong profit and free cash flow generation during the year.
Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall treasury risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets, and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposures limits is reviewed by the Groups Treasury Committee on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign exchange risk management The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising on the operations trading activities in foreign currencies.
Where commented on below, the sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and left unchanged throughout the reporting period, with all other variables held constant such as interest rates.
Translation risk The Group derived 90% of its revenue from businesses outside the United Kingdom, of which 66% related to operations in North America.
Fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and other currencies in relation to the Pound Sterling have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the results of the Groups operations when reported in Pound Sterling.
The Group decided not to hedge this translation risk.
In addition, the majority of assets are denominated in foreign currency, particularly in US dollars.
In order to provide a hedge against volatility in the value of these assets compared to the Groups earnings, and hence provide a natural hedge against the Groups principal lending covenant the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, the Group aims to borrow in foreign currencies in similar proportions to its generation of foreign currency EBITDA, where practical and economic.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of all other currencies against Pound Sterling would have increased or decreased 2010 Group operating profit by 5.9m 4.2m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement and would have increased or decreased net equity by 21.2m 16.4m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement.
Transaction risk The Group has a number of transaction-related foreign currency exposures, particularly between the Euro and the South African Rand, and between the US dollar and the Pound Sterling.
The Group seeks to hedge transaction-related exposures on a rolling 15- to 18-month forward basis and applies hedge accounting where the forwards can be designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship.
Based on the net of the annual sales and purchase-related exposures, all transaction-related foreign currency exposures to Group profit after hedging in existence at 31 December 2010 are immaterial.
The impact on net equity is determined by the unrecognised portion of open forward contracts at the year-end.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Euro against the Rand and of the US dollar against Pound Sterling would have decreased or increased net equity by 0.5m and 1.6m, respectively.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 73 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21.
Financial Instruments continued Interest rate risk management The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 60% of its borrowing costs at fixed interest rates.
The Group generally borrows long term in fixed rates but at times may borrow at floating rates and swap into fixed depending on credit market conditions.
Occasionally a portion of fixed debt interest is swapped into floating rates.
The combination of maintaining an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate debt, and the Groups policy of borrowing in foreign currency in proportion to its generation of foreign currency earnings, provides an effective hedge against the impact of interest rate and foreign currency volatility on total interest costs.
The following sensitivity analysis of the Groups and the Companys exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the beginning of the financial year, and held constant throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant such as foreign exchange rates.
If variable interest rates had been 0.5% lower or higher, the Groups and Companys net profit would have increased or decreased by 0.2m.
Any fixed interest debt is held to maturity and not fair value adjusted through the profit and loss.
An increase or decrease of 0.5% in the US dollar market interest rate for the fixed rate debt held up to maturity would have decreased or increased the fair value of the Groups and Companys borrowings by 3.5m.
The Groups and Companys sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the increased proportion of fixed debt.
Credit risk management The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The credit quality of customers is assessed taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Group is guarantor under the leases of two buildings in the UK, which arose on the disposal of former Group-owned subsidiaries in 2001 and 2004. Credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups and Companys maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Cash flow forecasts are produced monthly, together with appropriate capacity planning and scenario analysis, to ensure that bank covenant and liquidity targets will be met.
The Directors also regularly assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group, as part of a process to satisfy the Groups long-term strategic funding requirements.
As noted in the OFR on pages 10 to 24, the Group is currently in a well-funded position, with significant headroom under its committed borrowing facilities and no major renewal of borrowing facilities due until 2012.
It is considered unlikely that the Group will face any significant funding issues in the foreseeable future.

Acquisitions WahlcoMetroflex, Inc. On 16 August 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of WahlcoMetroflex, Inc. WMX, a manufacturer of dampers, expansion joints and exhaust gas systems for the global power generation, refinery and chemical processing industries based in Lewiston, Maine, USA.
WMXs products and markets are highly complementary to those of the Groups existing, and successful, Senior Flexonics Pathway operation and the combination of WMXs capabilities with the global market leadership of Senior Flexonics Pathway will allow the Group to offer an enhanced range of product solutions to its industrial customers.
The cash consideration was 8.9m and the acquisition was funded from the Groups existing debt facilities.

Acquisitions continued The goodwill of 5.5m arising from the acquisition results largely from the expectation that WMX will be able to leverage the combination of the Groups financial resources and Senior Flexonics Pathways customer network to generate significant medium-term growth well beyond what WMX would have been able to achieve if it had remained a privately held company.
The amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes is 6.2m, which includes 5.5m goodwill as noted above plus 0.1m of acquisition costs and 0.6m of adjustments resulting from the fair value exercise not recognised for tax purposes.
The financial assets acquired include trade receivables with a fair value of 1.3m and a gross contractual value of 1.3m, all of which is expected to be collectible.
Acquisition-related costs included in administrative expenses within trading profit in the Groups Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 amounted to 0.1m.
WMX contributed 2.8m external revenue and 0.3m to the Groups operating profit from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2010.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2010, Group revenue for the year ended 31 December 2010 would have been 573.2m and Group operating profit would have been 62.9m.

The disclosures below are in respect of both Group and Company.
a 1999 Executive Share Option Plan Equity-Settled Share Option Plans Under the 1999 Executive Share Option Plan 1999 Plan, options normally only became exercisable if the Groups adjusted earnings per share grew by not less than 4% per annum compound above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI over a period of three or more financial years commencing in January of the year of grant.
They lapse if not exercised within six years of the date of grant.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average of the closing mid-market price of the Companys shares in the three days prior to the date of grant.
The 1999 Plan is closed for new awards.
The following options were outstanding as at 31 December 2010 and 2009: Year ended 2010 Year ended 2009 Weighted Weighted Number average Number of average of share exercise share exercise options price options price Outstanding at 1 January 239,894 21.97p Granted Exercised 239,894 21.97p Forfeited Expired Outstanding at 31 December Exercisable at 31 December The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was nil p 2009 25.04p.
There were no equity-settled options outstanding at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
Cash-Settled Share Option Plans Under the 1999 Plan, shadow options were granted to certain employees.
These are subject to the same general terms and conditions as the above equity-settled options, however, on exercise the holder is entitled to receive an amount equal to the difference between the exercise price and the then market value of the shares in relation to which the shadow option is exercised.
There were no shadow share options outstanding at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.

Share-based Payments continued b 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan Equity-Settled Long Term Incentive Plans 2,122,172 shares were awarded under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan on 15 March 2010.
Awards under this plan have a three-year vesting period, subject to earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance conditions being met.
Half the awards have an attaching performance target for EPS growth over the three-year performance period of at least 5% per annum above the RPI.
The other half of the awards begin to vest if the Companys TSR falls in the top half of a comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period.
Vesting levels increase with higher performance.
The awards are settled by delivering shares to the participants.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with EPS conditions is 87.10p per share, which is essentially the share price at the date of grant of 95.25p per share less an allowance for dividends foregone over the three-year vesting period.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with TSR conditions is 66.70p per share, reflecting an adjustment of 77% to the fair value of the awards with EPS conditions due to the stringent TSR condition.
These fair values were calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
This model incorporates a technique called bootstrapping, which models the impact of the TSR condition.
The model inputs at the date of grant were the share price of 95.25p, a risk-free interest rate of 1.9% per annum, expected volatility of 64.0% per annum, net dividend yield of 3.0% per annum, and the performance conditions as noted above.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous three years.

Retirement Benefit Schemes The Group operates a number of pension plans in the UK, North America and Europe.
These include both defined contribution arrangements and defined benefit arrangements.
The largest defined benefit arrangement for the Group and Company, the Senior plc Pension Plan, is a funded scheme in the UK, providing benefits based on final pensionable emoluments for the employees of the Group and Company.
This plan was closed to new employees from April 2008.
A change to the Rules of the Plan was implemented prior to 31 December 2009 to introduce a cap on future pensionable earnings growth of 2% per annum from 6 April 2010.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2010 and, for the purposes of accounting under IAS 19, this valuation has been rolled forward to 31 December 2010.
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit plans in the USA, one of which was closed to future accrual from October 2009.
Separate disclosure is made for the funded UK and US defined benefit arrangements.
In both the UK and the USA the assets of funded plans are held in separate trustee administered funds managed by independent financial institutions and have pension costs assessed by consulting actuaries using the Projected Unit Method.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
For the Senior plc Pension Plan in the UK, the Trustee is Senior Trustee Limited.
The appointment of the Directors to the Board is determined by the plans Trust documentation.
There is a policy that at least one-third of all Directors should be nominated by members of the plan.
Currently there are two member-nominated Directors and four Directors that have been nominated by the Company, of which the Chairman and one other Director are viewed as independent.
The investment strategy for the plan is decided locally by the Trustees.
The primary investment objective is for the plan to be able to meet benefit payments as they fall due.
This objective is implemented by setting strategic asset allocations using a horizon-based approach.
Under this approach, all benefit cash flows expected to fall in the next 13 years the horizon period are met by investment in low-risk assets such as fixed interest and index-linked bonds.
Cash flows after the horizon period are met by investment in more volatile assets which are expected to deliver a higher return than bonds in the longer term.
In setting this strategy, the Trustees consider a wide range of asset classes, the risk and rewards of a number of possible asset allocation options, the sustainability of each asset class within each strategy, and the need for appropriate diversification between different asset classes.
The Trustees continue to review their investment strategy and have also implemented a switching mechanism to secure any outperformance of equities relative to bonds, by selling equities to buy bonds.
The Group also has a small number of unfunded post-retirement plans, including a closed healthcare scheme in the US.
Separate disclosure is provided for these arrangements.
a Defined contribution schemes The Group has a number of different defined contribution and government-sponsored arrangements in place in the countries in which it operates.
None of these are individually material to the Group and the aggregate cost of such schemes for the period was 3.9m 2009 3.9m.
b Defined benefit schemes The amount included in the Balance Sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of its defined benefit plans is set out below.

The expected rate of return on assets is calculated as a weighted average rate of return on each asset class.
Where such rates are not available in the market, the expected rate of return for each asset class is calculated by giving consideration to inflation, the risk-free rate of return based on government gilts securities, and the risk premium expected return in excess of the risk-free rate.
The market provides implied forecasts of both the inflation rate and the risk-free rate.
The risk premium is based primarily on historical data adjusted to reflect any systemic changes that have occurred in the relevant markets.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 89 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 36.
Retirement Benefit Schemes continued For the UK plan, the expected return on each asset class is as follows: 2010 2009 % % Equities 6.9 7.4 Bonds 4.7 4.8 Gilts 3.4 3.6 Cash 3.7 3.9 Total 5.0 5.6 For the UK plan, the estimated impact on the plan deficit at 31 December 2010 for changes in assumptions is as follows: Increase in plan deficit m 0.5% decrease in the discount rate 15.0 One-year increase in life expectancy 5.0 0.5% increase in inflation 9.0 For the UK plan, the Group has agreed with the Trustees to fund the plan deficit over a nine-year period.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid during 2011 to the UK plan is 8.1m 6.6m of which is to fund the past service deficit and to the USA funded plans is 1.1m.
g Other post-retirement liabilities This balance comprises an unfunded German pension plan 2.8m 2009 2.8m, unfunded closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the USA 0.6m 2009 0.5m and provision for post-retirement payments in France of 1.7m 2009 1.4m.
The closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the US have been valued on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 5.3%, and annual healthcare cost trend rate of 8.7%, reducing to 4.5% in 2028.
The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the healthcare cost trend rate is negligible to the Groups results.
The German plan has been subject to formal actuarial valuation on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 4.7%, salary growth 2.0% and inflation 1.5%.
In France, the provision arises from a legal obligation to make payments to retirees in the first two years post-retirement.
Hence, it is not subject to discounting to the same extent as the other longer-term post-retirement liabilities.
