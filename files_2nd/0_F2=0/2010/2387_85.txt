chairman and 10 years on the board, I would like to thank the shareholders The remuneration committee shared the group chief executives both for their challenge and their support as the company has navigated view that no bonuses should be paid on group-level results.
Thus through difficult, as well as successful, times.
Mr Dudley received no bonus for the year.
There is also no vesting of the 2008-2010 share element for any executive director.
Dr Hayward and Mr Inglis, who left BP during the course of the year, received their contractual entitlements of one years salary on termination, together with other limited entitlements.
Outstanding share element awards were preserved on a pro rata basis, with vesting being conditional on meeting applicable performance targets.
Neither was awarded any annual bonus for 2010.
While the tragedy of lost lives and environmental damage remains foremost in everyones minds, the committee also wished to fairly acknowledge the good business results in many parts of BP, delivered in the most testing of times.
Mr Conn and Dr Grote met or exceeded their specific segment functional targets for the year and were awarded 30% of their overall on-target bonuses, including the deferred element.
This reflected no payout on the portion related to group results as with all executive directors and was limited to on-target for the portion related to their strong segment functional results.
A third of their bonus is deferred into shares on a mandatory basis, matched, and will vest in three years subject to meeting a safety and environmental hurdle during the period.
Both individuals may elect to defer an additional third into shares on the same basis as the mandatory deferral.
Both will receive salary increases in 2011 as noted in the table opposite.
