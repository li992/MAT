The Company elected to pay dividends to the Babcock Employee Share Trust at the rate of 0.001p per share during the year, though full dividends were paid in respect of shares held by the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust.
The Company meets the operating expenses of the Trusts.
The Trusts enable shares in the Company to be held or purchased and made available to employees through the grant and exercise of rights or awards under the Companys employee share schemes.
The Trusts are discretionary settlements for the benefit of employees within the Group.
The Company is excluded from benefiting under them.
They are controlled and managed outside the UK and each has a single corporate trustee which is an independent trustee services organisation.
The right to remove and appoint the trustees rests ultimately with the Company.
The trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust is required to waive both voting rights and dividends payable on any share in the Company in excess of 0.001p, unless otherwise directed by the Company, but the trustee of the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust does not have the power to waive dividends due on Babcock ordinary shares and therefore receives the full amount of any dividends declared.
