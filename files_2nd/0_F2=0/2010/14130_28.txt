Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 101 28 Retirement benefit schemes continued c Background The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, covering the majority of UK employees.
The defined benefit schemes are funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary.
Under the 1 1 defined benefit schemes, members are entitled to retirement benefits calculated as a proportion varying between and for 30 80 each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of employment.
The final salary sections of all of the pension schemes listed below are closed to new entrants and the age profile of scheme participants is expected to rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise in the future.
The UK defined benefit schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: UK defined benefit scheme Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension Scheme STPS 31 March 2007 Severn Trent Water Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2009 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK defined benefit schemes.
The Severn Trent Senior Staff Pension Scheme was merged with the STPS on 31 March 2009.
The group has an obligation to pay pensions to a number of former employees, whose benefits would otherwise have been restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision for such benefits amounting to 7.6 million 2009: 6.2 million is included in an unfunded scheme within the retirement benefit obligation.
d Actuarial assumptions The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the valuations of all group schemes were as follows: 2010 2009 % % Price inflation 3.60 2.90 Salary increases 4.10 3.90 Pension decreases in payment 3.60 3.00 Pension increases in deferment 3.60 2.90 Discount rate 5.70 6.70 Long term rate of return on: Equities 8.00 8.00 Gilts 4.50 4.20 Corporate bonds 5.70 6.70 Property 7.00 6.10 Cash 4.50 0.50 The assumption for price inflation is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term fixed rate gilts and on index linked gilts.
The discount rate is based on the annualised yield from the iBoxx over 15 year AA rated sterling corporate bond index.
The expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the life of the benefit obligation.
For gilts and corporate bonds the expected rates of return are based on market yields.
For equities, an equity risk premium has been added to the gilt rate.
Financial statements 102 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2010 28 Retirement benefit schemes continued d Actuarial assumptions continued The mortality assumptions adopted are based on mortality tables applicable to the sex and year of birth of individual members, with the medium cohort allowance for future improvements in longevity.
For men the assumptions are based on the 00 series tables and for women the 92 series, both projected to calendar year 2005 with medium cohort improvements to 2005 and a two year age rating applied.
These have been based on a mortality investigation carried out in conjunction with the valuation of the STPS, carried out on behalf of the trustees, as at 31 March 2007.
The life expectancies implied by the mortality assumptions adopted at each year end are as follows 2010 2009 Age to which current pensioners aged 65 are expected to live men years 85.3 85.1 women years 88.6 88.2 Age to which future pensioners aged 45 at the balance sheet date are expected to live men years 86.5 85.9 women years 89.6 88.9 The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price inflation and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities and service cost resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 34 million Price inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 34 million Mortality Increase life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 40 million e Contributions to the schemes Contribution rates are set in consultation with the trustees for each scheme and each participating employer.
It is anticipated that normal contributions to the scheme in the year ending 31 March 2011 will be in the order of 30 million and lump sum deficit reduction contributions of 10 million are planned subject to the outcome of the ongoing actuarial valuation.

Weekly volatility in the observed data varied between 10% and 40%.
For the 2009 10 LTIP award and the 2008 09 award the comparator group is the companies ranked 51150 in the FTSE index.
Comparator group volatility was therefore based on observed volatility for the FTSE 250 index.
Correlation between Severn Trent and the comparator group was based on the average pairwise correlation for companies in the FTSE 250.
The share price at the grant date was 11.34 2009: 12.80.
The vesting period commences before the grant date.
Performance in the vesting period prior to the grant date is taken into account in determining the fair value of the award.
Dividends paid on shares during the vesting period are accumulated during the vesting period and released subject to achievement of the performance condition, in the same manner as the underlying shares.
As a result a dividend yield assumption is not required.
The 2009 Services LTIP is based entirely on non-market conditions and hence market assumptions are not required to determine the fair value of the award.
For 2010 it has been assumed that performance against the Services LTIP non-market vesting conditions will be 78%.
Details of the basis of the LTIP schemes are set out in the remuneration report on page 50. ii Employee Sharesave Scheme Under the terms of the Sharesave Scheme, the board may grant the right to purchase ordinary shares in the company to those employees who have entered into an HMRC approved Save As You Earn contract for a period of three or five years.

On 5 March 2007 the group received notice of a claim for 23.4 million from Veolia Proprete SA Veolia alleging breach of warranty in relation to the disposal of Biffa Belgium.
The group has subsequently received notice from Veolia of a further claim for 5 million relating to the same matter.
The group considers that there is no basis for this claim and hence no provision has been recorded in the financial statements in relation to this matter.
Following a hearing in the Commercial Court in Belgium in February 2010, the Court rendered judgment in favour of the group on 1 April 2010 and declared all of Veolias claims to be unfounded.
The group is not aware of any other liability that is likely to result from these guarantees and indemnities that has not been provided for in these financial statements.
