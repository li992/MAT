Finance debt continued Fair values The estimated fair value of finance debt is shown in the table below together with the carrying amount as reflected in the balance sheet.
Long-term borrowings in the table below include the portion of debt that matures in the year from 31 December 2010, whereas in the balance sheet the amount would be reported within current finance debt.
The disposal deposits noted above are excluded from this analysis.
The carrying amount of the groups short-term borrowings, comprising mainly commercial paper, bank loans, overdrafts and US Industrial Revenue Municipal bonds, approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the groups long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.

Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The group defines capital as the total equity of the group.
The groups approach to managing capital is set out in its financial framework which was revised during 2010, with the objective of maintaining a capital structure that allows the group to execute its strategy and is resilient to inherent volatility.
The group intends to invest to grow the company and shareholder value sustainably through the business cycle, whilst providing the group with financial flexibility in the medium term as the disposal programme is completed and commitments to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust are fulfilled.
In the light of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the agreement to establish the $20-billion trust fund, the BP board reviewed its dividend policy and decided that no ordinary share dividends would be paid in respect of the first three quarters of 2010.
On 1 February 2011, BP announced the resumption of quarterly dividend payments, with a fourth quarter dividend of 7 cents per share.
We believe this level is supported by the success of our disposal programme thus far, and by the improving business environment, but is balanced by the recognition of our continuing obligation to fund the trust until the end of 2013 and the need to retain financial flexibility.
We intend to increase the dividend level over time in line with the circumstances of the company.
Going forward, the group intends to maintain a significant cash liquidity buffer and reduce the net debt ratio to within a range of 10-20%.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is claimed, less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt and net debt ratio are non-GAAP measures.
BP uses these measures to provide useful information to investors.
Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total.
The net debt ratio enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to equity from shareholders.
The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings Derivative financial instruments.
All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
During 2010, the company did not repurchase any of its own shares.
