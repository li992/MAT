336 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 E10 Geographical analysis of value of new business The value generated by new business written during the period is the present value of the projected stream of after-tax distributable profit from that business, including expected profit between point of sale and the valuation date.
The value of new business has been calculated using economic assumptions at the point of sale which has been implemented with the assumptions being taken as those appropriate to the start of each quarter.
For contracts that are re-priced more frequently, weekly or monthly economic assumptions have been used.
The operating assumptions are consistent with those used to determine the embedded value.
The value of new business is shown after the effect of the frictional costs of holding required capital, and after the effect of the costs of residual nonhedgeable risks on the same basis as for the in-force covered business.
