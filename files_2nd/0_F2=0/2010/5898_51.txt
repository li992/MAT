Notes to the Group financial statements continued 33.
Acquisitions On 10 September 2009, the Group acquired certain operating assets and liabilities of Belt Service Srl, a conveyor belting service company based in Italy.
The acquisition strengthens the Groups service network in Europe.
The initial cash consideration was 0.2m with deferred consideration of 0.5m, based on exchange rates at the date of completion.
On 7 July 2010, the Group acquired the entire share capital of MRI Manufacturing & Research, Inc, based in Arizona, USA.
They are a development and manufacturing company that designs, validates and manufactures cutting-edge silicone based medical devices.
The acquisition strengthens the Groups presence in the medical device market.
The initial cash consideration was 2.9m with deferred consideration estimated at 2.6m, based on exchange rates at the date of completion.
From the respective dates of acquisition, these businesses contributed 2.3m to Group revenue, 0.2m to Group operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items and 0.1m to Group operating profit.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 September 2009, it is estimated that Group revenue would have been 557.5m, Group operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items would have been 57.3m and Group operating profit would have been 49.4m.
These amounts have been calculated by adjusting the results of the acquired businesses to reflect the effect of the Groups accounting policies as if they had been in effect from 1 September 2009.
Details of the provisional aggregate assets and liabilities acquired, based on exchange rates at the dates of completion, are given below.

Contingent and deferred consideration on current year acquisitions principally relates to the estimated value of earn-out payments based on future performance.
The maximum amount payable is 10.1m, based on exchange rates at the date of completion.
This amount is discounted using a suitable risk free, pre-tax rate based on borrowings that match the maturity of the consideration being discounted.
Adjustments to increase the fair value of net assets acquired by 0.3m in respect of prior year acquisitions have been made within 12 months of the acquisition date, as permitted by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Deferred consideration held as provisions on prior year acquisitions has also been increased by 0.3m due to a re-assessment of the total consideration payable.
The overall effect of these adjustments on goodwill is nil.
The comparative financial information has not been re-stated by way of a prior year adjustment as the amounts are not considered to be material.
Goodwill arising on acquisition principally represents the workforce and anticipated synergies gained through the acquisitions.
All goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
