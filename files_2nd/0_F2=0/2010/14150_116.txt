A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below.
2010 2009 m m Netherlands 224.5 232.9 Belgium 18.6 19.6 United Kingdom 12.9 11.4 256.0 263.9 The Group estimates the recoverable amount of a CGU using a value in use model by projecting cashflows for the next five years from the five year plan with a terminal value using a growth rate all discounted at the Groups estimated average cost of capital.
In circumstances where this is considered inappropriate, such as for landfill sites, projected cashflows may be estimated over much longer periods of up to 25 years.
The post-tax discount rate used is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC of 8%.
As most CGUs have integrated operations across large parts of the Group this is considered appropriate for all parts of the business.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 11%.
The growth rate is 2% and does not exceed the long term average growth.
