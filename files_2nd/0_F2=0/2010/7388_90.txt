FInAnCIAL PoLICIes For rIsk mAnAGement And tHeIr oBJeCtIves Credit and concentration of risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks, expired goods and without recourse discounts.
A provision for impairment is made where there is an identified lossevent which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
In line with local market practice, clients in the MENA region are offered relatively longer payment terms compared to clients in Europe and theUS.
