The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded where available.

Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
This is shown in the table in Note 11 a above.
Cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit The Companys exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is managed by cash deposits only being placed with banks and financial institutions which carry Moodys ratings of Aa3 P1 for long-term and short-term deposits.
Other receivables Other receivables at the period end consist primarily of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.
Management provide for irrecoverable debts when there are indicators that a balance may not be recoverable.

No financial assets are held in foreign currencies.
Due to the Companys lack of exposure to currency risk no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Interest rate risk The Company has no interest bearing financial liabilities, and its interest bearing financial assets consists of only cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment.
These financial assets are exposed to interest rate risk as the Company holds money market deposits at floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by investing cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks split between fixed term deposits, notice accounts and money market funds.
At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Companys interest bearing financial instruments was: 28 November 2010 000 Fixed rate instruments Financial assets 70,000 Variable rate instruments Financial assets 74,361 Sensitivity analysis An increase of 100 basis points 1.0% in interest rates at the balance sheet date will increase equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
100 basis points was deemed an appropriate rate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.
This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.

13 Loss per share Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares in issue during the period adjusted to reflect the conversion of the ordinary shares and preference shares from Ocado Limited to Ocado Group plc on a 1:100 basis on 9 February 2010.
The loss for the period is equally attributable to the shareholders of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares.
For more information see Note 10.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares, adjusted to reflect the conversion of the ordinary shares and the convertible preference shares from Ocado Limited to Ocado Group plc as mentioned above.
The Company has two categories of potentially dilutive shares, namely share options and shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOS.
There was no difference in the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share as the effect of all potentially dilutive shares outstanding was anti-dilutive.
Basic and diluted loss per share has been calculated on the following basis: 51 weeks ended 28 November 2010 000s Issued ordinary shares and convertible preference shares at the beginning of the period Effect of shares issued in the period 374,461 Effect of share options exercised in the period 414 Weighted average number of shares in issue during the period 374,875 Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement 000 Loss attributable to owners of the Company 2,084 pence Basic and diluted loss per share 0.56 The only transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of these financial statements were the exercise of 525,000 share options.
