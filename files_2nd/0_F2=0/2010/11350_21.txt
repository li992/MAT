Directors report Introduction Business strategy Operating Financial Operational Risks and Appendix Board directors and business environment performance performance resources biographies review Financial performance continued Earnings per share and dividend cover Basic and diluted earnings per share EPS for the year were 23.67 pence and 23.62 pence respectively.
In 2009, the basic and diluted loss per share was 2.45 pence.
EPS from continuing operations, adjusted for deferred tax, were 25.51 pence 2009: 22.05 pence.
From 2009 10, the Group has not adjusted for the credit in respect of the amortisation of debt fair value as this is no longer considered material and has now reached a stable level.
The credit for the year ended 31 March 2010 is 5.3 million 2009: 5.6 million and would have an impact on the adjusted EPS of 1.02 pence per share 2009: 1.08 pence per share.
A final dividend of 8.85 pence per share for the year ended 31 March 2010 will be recommended by the Board to shareholders at the AGM on 29 July 2010 and, if approved, will be paid on 10 September 2010 to shareholders on the Companys Register of Members at the close of business on 13 August 2010.
Together with the ordinary interim dividend of 4.39 pence per share, the ordinary dividends paid and proposed for the year will be 13.24 pence per share 2009: 12.79 pence per share.
This represents an increase of 3.5%, based on average inflation over the year of 0.5%, on the ordinary dividend for the previous year and is consistent with the Boards decision to maintain a progressive dividend policy with real increases of around 3% per annum.
The board of our main subsidiary, NWL, has proposed a dividend policy consistent with the underlying growth assumptions adopted by Ofwat at its price reviews in 2004 and 2009.
The dividend cover for the year, excluding deferred tax, was 2.0x 2009: 1.8x.
The cover level has increased principally as a consequence of the application of lower RPI to the index linked bonds.
Northumbrian Water Share Scheme Trustees Limited, which at the date of this report held 914,518 shares to be used in the future to satisfy the vesting and exercise of awards under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, has waived the right to all dividends on the shares it holds.
Further details of the LTIP can be found in the directors remuneration report.
