Notes to the financial statements continued Exceptional items Items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement.
The Directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Groups underlying business performance.
Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing and newly-acquired businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or individual assets and asset impairments, including currently developable land, work in progress and goodwill.
Restructuring costs Restructuring costs are recognised in the income statement when the Group has a detailed plan that has been communicated to the affected parties.
A liability is accrued for unpaid restructuring costs.
Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2010, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these are expected to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Comments on specific new standards or amendments are as follows: IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
This interpretation outlines when refunds or reductions in future contributions can be treated as available under IAS 19 Employee Benefits and how a minimum funding requirement affects future contributions or may give rise to a liability.
This is effective from the period beginning 1 January 2011.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure Amendment.
The amendment provides clarification of the standard and requires additional disclosures in relation to financial instruments.
This is effective for the period beginning 1 January 2011.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.

Exceptional items Inventory carrying value The Group has reviewed the carrying value of its inventory items at the reporting date, comparing the carrying cost of the asset against estimates of net realisable value.
Net realisable value has been arrived at using the Boards estimates of achievable selling prices taking into account current market conditions, and after deduction of an appropriate amount for selling costs.
This has given rise to no exceptional items relating to the carrying value of inventory as at 31 December 2010 2009: 2.7 million exceptional release.
Financing charge There were no items in 2010 2009: 4.2 million.
Other exceptional items There were no items in 2010 2009: 1.2 million.
Total exceptional items for 2010 are nil 2009: 2.7 million.
