The basis for supporting the recognition of the deferred tax asset is of 36.5m net realisable value provision.

This to land and 23.3m 2009: 40.9m is attributed to work in progress.
The allocation of land between Type 1 and Type 2 is described in the strong earnings history provides evidence of historic profitability.
ii Identifiable causes of the losses and likelihood of reoccurrence As discussed in note 1, the Group considers the carrying value of inventories to be a critical accounting judgement.
The carried forward tax losses arise primarily from the exceptional net realisable value provisions created in 2008 and 2009 and to a lesser extent the trading losses in 2009 arising from the challenging housing market conditions.
The provisions principally arise from the The net realisable value provision movement is analysed below: Type 1 Type 2 Total reductions in house prices and the reduced rate of sales which have reduced land values.
Whilst the housing market remains uncertain, m m m short of a collapse of market conditions from those experienced to date during 2010, material provisioning is not anticipated to reoccur regularly into the future.

2 Act 2010, which was substantially enacted on 20 July 2010 includes legislation reducing the rate of corporation tax from 28.0% to 27.0% from 1 April 2011.
The carrying value of the 77.2m deferred tax asset at June 2010 at 27.0% would be 74.4m.
The net realisable value provisions of 39.1m and 39.2m created and released in the year are the result of our review at the balance sheet date in the context of prevailing market conditions and the re-assessment of selling prices and costs.
