Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial assets and liabilities recognised by the Group at fair value can be classied as value using Level 2.
These comprise derivative assets at fair value of 171,000 2009: 371,000 and derivative liability at fair value of 531,000 2009: 103,000.
CURRENCY RISK The Company has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the fair value of the Groups financial instruments, to the income statement and to equity of a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 31 March 2010, with all other variables remaining constant.
A 10% variation in the valuation of sterling at the balance sheet date would have an impact of approximately 2.4 million 2009: 2.8 million.
All of this would be taken to the income statement.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause uctuations in exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.

Typically the Company draws under these facilities for periods between one week and three months and the interest rates applicable, LIBOR or equivalent, are determined at the outset of each drawing.
The above table is drawn up on the assumption that the Company will continue to draw on these loans until the expiry of the facility and that interest rates have been set at the rate applicable at 31 March.
The Companys financial assets mature within one year.
