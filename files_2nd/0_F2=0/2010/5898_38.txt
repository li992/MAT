Financial risk management In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain financial risks, principally foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks are managed by the central treasury function in conjunction with the operating units, in accordance with risk management policies that are designed to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on financial performance.
The policies are reviewed and approved by the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations around the world and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.
Where cost effective, the exposures arising from the translation of the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
Some Group operations also enter into commercial transactions in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Exposures arising from the translation of foreign currency transactions are continually monitored and material exposures are managed through the use of forward contracts or options once cash flows can be identified with sufficient certainty.
Exposures arising from the translation of intra-group lending are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
The following table shows the impact due to the retranslation of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities in the Group's operations of a, reasonably possible, 10% movement in the Groups principal foreign currency exchange rates at the year end date.

The effect on shareholders equity is due to the effect on profit as well as interest rate and currency swaps and the hedge of net investments in foreign currencies.
Further details of the currency profile of borrowings are given in note 22.
6 0 F E N N E R P L C A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 0 Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.
This is reviewed regularly and is managed through the use of an appropriate mix of fixed rate and floating rate instruments, including the use of interest rate swaps, in response to market conditions.
The impact of interest rate risk on the Group's result is due to changes in interest rates on net floating rate cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
At 31 August 2010, if interest rates on the Group's net floating rate cash and cash equivalents and borrowings had been 100 basis points higher, a reasonably possible movement, with all other variables held constant, the effect on profit before taxation in the year would have been a charge of 0.2m 2009: 0.7m.
A reduction of 100 basis points would have the equal and opposite effect.
There is no further impact on shareholders' equity.
Further details of the interest rate profile of borrowings are given in note 22.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk to ensure that sufficient resources are available for both short-term working capital and longer-term strategic requirements.
This is achieved through an appropriate mix of long and short-term borrowings and, as far as possible, the major part of the Groups total borrowings are managed so that they are drawn down using committed debt facilities which would not mature for at least one year.
The Groups principal loan facilities are raised and managed centrally but are supplemented by local overdraft and working capital facilities.
Committed debt facilities principally comprise bank loans and private placements.
The Group regularly monitors expected cash flows against availability of financing.
Regular updating of business forecasts, including cash flows, is a process embedded into the Groups internal financial reporting routines.
Forecasts are initially carried out at an individual business unit level but are consolidated and reviewed by Group management.
The availability of financing, headroom over existing facilities and forward compliance with financial covenants are monitored against expected cash flows.
The process takes into account the shorter-term liquidity needs of individual business units or territories as well as the availability of funding to fulfil longer-term strategic objectives such as major capital expenditure or business acquisitions.
The maturity profile of non-derivative financial liabilities is as follows: Between Less than one and More than one year five years five years Total m m m m 31 August 2010 Trade and other payables excluding statutory liabilities 108.3 4.2 - 112.5 Bank overdrafts 0.1 - - 0.1 Bank loans 22.7 70.4 - 93.1 Other loans 8.0 17.9 63.2 89.1 Finance leases 0.3 - - 0.3 139.4 92.5 63.2 295.1 31 August 2009 Trade and other payables excluding statutory liabilities 78.7 - - 78.7 Bank overdrafts 0.1 - - 0.1 Bank loans 28.3 111.2 - 139.5 Other loans 7.9 21.5 65.0 94.4 Finance leases 0.1 - - 0.1 115.1 132.7 65.0 312.8 The above analysis includes both principal and interest amounts.

Credit risk Credit risk principally arises on short-term deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk arising on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is managed through the use of counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group only trades with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to take on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The credit risk arising on trade receivables is spread across a large number of customers and across many countries.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
An analysis showing the ageing of trade receivables not impaired is given in note 17.
