Inflationary growth assumptions In July 2010 the UK Government announced its intention to pass legislation amending the statutory revaluation of pension scheme benefits and increases to pensions in payment under defined benefit pension schemes from RPI to CPI measures.
A change to CPI would affect the Groups defined benefit scheme by reducing the deficit and therefore the net liability recognised in the balance sheet.
After reviewing UITF Abstract 48 the directors believe that no adjustment is appropriate at 1 January 2011.
The directors have continued to apply prudent assumptions in relation to benefit increases.

The options exercised during the year had a weighted average market value of 4.74 2009: 4.24.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes model.
The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model.

The historical volatility is calculated using a weekly rolling share price for the three year period immediately prior to the option grant date.
Share options are granted under a service condition and, for grants to senior employees, a non-market performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
