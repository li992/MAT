Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 107 8.
Pension liability continued Projected profit loss recognition to 31 December 2011: Due to the significant volatility in investment markets, it is difficult to project forward the FRS 17 figures for the next year with confidence.
The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: the return on assets from 31 December 2010 is 5.7 per cent pa: contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2011 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the profit and loss account are: 2011 $ million Current service cost 0.2 Interest on obligation 1.7 Expected return on Scheme assets 1.6 Total 0.3 Sensitivity and risk The results of the calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used.
The balance sheet position revealed by FRS 17 calculations must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of assets with a significant exposure to equities is being compared with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields.
As at 31 December 2010, a one percentage point change in this assumption would have had the following effects on the closing defined benefit obligation: Discount rate: 5.4% pa Discount rate: Discount rate: as used for report 4.4% pa 6.4% pa $ million $ million $ million Defined benefit obligation 32.3 38.6 27.0 The key risks which could significantly impact the balance sheet, and to a lesser extent the profit and loss account, are as follows: falls in asset values which are not offset by a rise in the discount rate used to value liabilities: a reduction in the discount rate, which will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities: an increase in price inflation and or salary inflation: and improving life expectation lower mortality rates resulting in benefits being paid for longer.
Unfunded pensions The company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2010 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2009: US$0.9 million.
Commitments and guarantees At the year-end date the company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, had jointly guaranteed the groups borrowing facilities consisting of a US$175.0 million term loan and a NOK 100.0 million US$17.2 million Exploration Financing Facility, both maturing in 2012, and a US$300.0 million term loan, a US$456.8 million revolving credit facility and a 399.5 million US$623.2 million letter of credit facility, all maturing in 2015.
