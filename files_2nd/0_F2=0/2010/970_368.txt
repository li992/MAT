2 Includes sensitivities for non-hedge derivatives related to capital expenditure.
The above sensitivities are calculated with reference to a single moment in time and are subject to change due to a number of factors including: fluctuating trade receivable and trade payable balances: derivative instruments and borrowings settled throughout the year: fluctuating cash balances: changes in currency mix: and commercial paper with short term maturities, which is regularly replaced or settled.
As the sensitivities are limited to year end financial instrument balances they do not take account of the Groups sales and operating costs which are highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices and exchange rates.
In addition, each of the sensitivities is calculated in isolation, whilst in reality commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies do not move independently.
