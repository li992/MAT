107 17 Deferred tax continued At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses excluding UK capital losses and advance corporation tax of 52.7 million 2009: 82.4 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 7.5 million 2009: 33.0 million of such losses, which may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the remaining 45.2 million 2009: 49.4 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 129.0 million 2009: 95.0 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
