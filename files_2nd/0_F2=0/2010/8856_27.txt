NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2010 1 Segmental information As described in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2009, the group reorganised its divisional structure on 1st April 2009.
The Catalysts and Chemicals business, which makes precious metal and some base metal catalysts and precious metal chemicals, has been transferred into the Precious Metal Products Division.
The remaining businesses in the Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Division have been renamed as the Fine Chemicals Division.
The segmental information below reflects the new divisional structure and comparative information has been restated to reflect the change.
For management purposes, the group is organised into three operating divisions Environmental Technologies, Precious Metal Products and Fine Chemicals and each division is represented by a director on the Board of Directors.
These operating divisions represent the groups segments.
Their principal activities are described on pages 12 to 19.
The performance of the divisions is assessed by the Board of Directors on underlying operating profit, which is before amortisation of acquired intangibles, major impairment and restructuring charges and profit or loss on disposal of businesses.
Sales between segments are made at market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.

The revenue is reported in Precious Metal Products as it is generated by the groups platinum marketing and distribution activities and so has a very low return on sales.

Due to the global recession, these early phase discovery biotech companies were unable to gain funding and consequently the facilitys revenue significantly declined and is not expected to recover in the short term.
Therefore the carrying amounts of the facilitys freehold building, capitalised software and plant and machinery exceeded their recoverable amount, which was determined to be their fair value less costs to sell based on an external valuation.
This gives rise to an impairment loss of 11.3 million.
It is excluded from underlying operating profit.
In March 2009 the group announced the closure of its Fine Chemicals manufacturing facility in Ireland to consolidate manufacturing of prostaglandin products at its facility in Massachusetts, USA.
The closure of the facility in Ireland gave rise to a restructuring charge of 9.4 million in the year ended 31st March 2009.
It was excluded from underlying operating profit.

In the year ended 31st March 2009 Mr N A P Carson, Chief Executive, bought his company car from the company for 8,500, which was its current market price at the time of the sale.
This transaction was settled during that year.
Other than this and the compensation above there were no transactions with any key management personnel.
There were no balances outstanding at the year end.
Information on the directors remuneration is given in the Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 56.
13 Share-based payments Share options Equity settled share options were granted to employees at the average of the market value of the companys shares over the three days prior to the date of grant and were subject to performance targets over a three year period and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options were granted was based on a percentage of the employees salary and from 2001 to 2006 approximately 800 employees were granted options each year.
In 2007 a new long term incentive plan was introduced and allocations of shares under this plan replaced the granting of share options.
No share options were granted in the years ended 31st March 2008, 2009 and 2010.
Options granted in 2004 to 2006 were subject to a minimum three year performance target of earnings per share EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum.
Other performance targets were EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
If the performance targets were not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options would lapse.
The targets for options granted in 2004, 2005 and the 3% and 4% targets for options granted in 2006 have been met and so these options are exercisable.
The 5% target for options granted in 2006 was not met and so these options have lapsed.
Gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Options granted in 2001 to 2003 can only be exercised if the normalised EPS has grown by at least UK RPI plus 4% per annum over any three consecutive years during the life of the options.
They were subject to annual retesting until they lapse on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Since the targets have been met all these options are exercisable.
Some options granted in 2000 are still outstanding.
These were subject to a performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI plus 2% over the three year performance period.
Since that target has been met these options are exercisable.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The 2007 LTIP also replaced share allocations made under the previous LTIP.
Under the 2007 LTIP, shares are allocated to approximately 850 of the groups executive directors, senior managers and middle managers based on a percentage of salary and are subject to performance targets over a three year period.
At 31st March 2010, shares allocated in 2007, 2008 and 2009 at 31st March 2009, shares allocated in 2007 and 2008 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The minimum release of 15% of the allocation is subject to the achievement of EPS growth of 6% compound per annum over the three year period.
For the maximum release of 100% of the allocation, EPS must have grown by at least 15% compound per annum.
The number of allocated shares released will vary on a straight line basis between these points.
Allocations will lapse if EPS growth is less than 6% compound per annum over the three year performance period.
For the shares allocated in 2009 only, the performance conditions have been relaxed and so the minimum release requires EPS growth of 3% compound per annum and the maximum release requires EPS growth of 10% compound per annum.
Under the previous LTIP, shares were allocated to directors and certain key executives of the group based upon a percentage of salary and were subject to performance conditions over a three year period.
At 31st March 2010, no shares at 31st March 2009, shares allocated in 2006 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The release of shares was subject to a relative total shareholder return TSR compared to those companies ranked 51 to 150 in the FTSE index over a three year period.
All shares were released if the company ranked in the 76th percentile or above.
None of the shares were released if the company ranked in the 50th percentile or below.
If the company ranked between these percentiles 35% to 100% of the shares were released on a straight line basis.
In addition EPS growth must have been at least equal to UK RPI plus 2% per annum over the three year performance period before any release was made.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK and Overseas Under the SIP, all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of basic pay each month, subject to a 125 per month limit.
The SIP trustees buy shares partnership shares at market value each month with the employees contributions.
For each partnership share purchased, the group purchases two shares matching shares which are allocated to the employee.
In the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers partnership shares within three years from the date of allocation, the linked matching shares are forfeited.
In the Overseas SIP, partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 75 ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2010 13 Share-based payments continued 401k approved savings investment plans 401k plans In the US there are two 401k plans, one for salaried employees and one for hourly employees.
Salaried employees may contribute up to 50% of their base pay and hourly employees up to 20% of their base pay, both subject to a statutory limit.
Salaried employees choosing Johnson Matthey Plc shares matching are matched 100% of the first 4% contributed and hourly employees are matched 50% of the first 2% contributed.
Employees may contribute after one month of service and are eligible for matching after one year of service.

76 - Johnson Matthey NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2010 14 Post-employment benefits 14a Group The group operates a number of post-employment benefits plans around the world, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of the plans are defined benefit which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds and retirement benefits are based on factors such as employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Some of the plans are defined contribution, where the retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans was 2.9 million 2009 2.5 million.
The major defined benefit plans are pension plans and post-retirement medical plans in the UK and the US.
The pension plans are final salary plans except for the new section of the UK plan which is a career average salary plan and the US hourly plan which is a fixed benefit based upon years of service.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2009 for the main UK pension plan and 30th June 2009 for the US pension plans and the valuations of all of the UK and US plans were updated to 31st March 2010 by qualified independent actuaries.

The current mortality assumptions for all major plans retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience.
The mortality tables used for the groups largest plan, which is in the UK, at its last full actuarial valuation were PMA92C2009 for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C2009 for female members retiring in normal health.
Allowance for future mortality improvements was made in line with the medium cohort versions of these tables with an underpin of 1% p. a.
Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill-health.
These tables have been carried through into the balance sheet calculation at 31st March 2010, allowing for the expected improvements over the intervening year.
The mortality tables used for the income statements and the balance sheet calculation at 31st March 2009 were PMA92C2006 for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C2006 for female members retiring in normal health.
Allowance for future mortality improvements was made in line with the medium cohort versions of these tables and expected improvements over the three intervening years was also allowed for.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Goodwill is allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2010 2009 2010 2009 million million million million Environmental Technologies Emission Control Technologies Non-light Duty Catalysts 90.4 90.7 Process Technologies 231.6 231.9 110.5 132.4 Precious Metal Products Catalysts and Chemicals 25.6 26.9 Other 5.8 5.3 Fine Chemicals Macfarlan Smith 117.1 117.1 Pharmaceutical Materials and Services 21.7 22.8 Research Chemicals 21.6 21.3 513.8 516.0 110.5 132.4 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period except as discussed below.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions.
Assumptions on the likelihood and timing of new product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the budget and plan years.
Other assumptions such as market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the estimated tax cash flows and risk applicable to each CGU.
For the Non-light Duty Catalysts CGU five year plans have been approved by management.
Over the next decade management expects the markets for heavy duty diesel catalysts and stationary emissions catalysts will grow significantly, based on emission control legislation already in place or anticipated, as described on page 13 of the Business Review.
Therefore the cash flow projections have been extrapolated using a long term average growth rate of 20% 2009 3% for years 6 to 10 and 3% 2009 3% after that.
The impairment test results in headroom of more than 20% over the carrying value of the CGUs net assets and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 87 ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2010 16 Goodwill continued For Process Technologies the long term average growth rate used was 5% 2009 3% and the discount rate was 10.9% 2009 11.4%.
The impairment test results in headroom of 85% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Macfarlan Smith the long term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2009 2.5% and the discount rate was 9.0% 2009 10.3%.
The impairment test results in headroom of over 70% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Catalysts and Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 4% 2009 2% and the discount rate was 10.9% 2009 11.4%.
The impairment test results in headroom of more than 100% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Pharmaceutical Materials and Services the long term average growth rate used was 4% 2009 2.5% and the discount rate was 10.9% 2009 11.4%.
The resulting headroom exceeds the carrying value of the net assets by 90% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Research Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 5% 2009 2.5% and the discount rate was 9.9% 2009 10.7%.

29 Financial risk management The groups and parent companys activities expose them to a variety of financial risks including market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Market risk includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company, under policies approved by the board, are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Some derivative financial instruments used to manage financial risk are not designated as hedges and so are classified as held for trading.
The group and parent company do not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
29a Interest rate risk The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps to maintain borrowings in appropriate currencies and at competitive rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of bonds attributable to changes in interest rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges as they hedge the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bonds attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
The cash flow on one of the cross currency swaps occurred in March 2010 when the related bond matured.
The remaining cross currency swaps cash flows are expected to occur in 2015 when the bond which it hedges matures.
The interest element of the cash flow hedges is realised in the income statement each year and the exchange effect on the matured swap was realised in the income statement in 2010 and the exchange effect on the remaining swap is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2015.
At 31st March 2010, 65% 2009 63% of the groups net debt and 57% 2009 55% of the parent companys net debt were at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 5.14% 2009 5.13%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
Based on the groups net debt funded at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1% change in all interest rates would have a 1.7 million 2009 2.0 million impact on the groups profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
29b Foreign currency risk The group operates globally with the majority of its profits earned outside the UK.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most of its investment in the USA and Europe by borrowing US dollars and euros respectively.
Although much of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure.
To a lesser extent the group has also financed a portion of its investment in China, Japan and South Africa 2009 Japan using currency borrowings and swaps.
The group has designated the currency swaps and one euro loan fair value of the loan was 120.3 million as hedges of net investments in foreign operations 2009 currency swaps, one euro loan and some of the US dollar bonds fair value of the loan and bonds was 298.5 million as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries net assets against movements in exchange rates.

These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2011.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5% 8.0 cent 2009 8.6 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 2.9 million 2009 3.2 million impact on operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5% 5.6 cent 2009 6.0 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 0.9 million 2009 1.3 million impact on operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
For financial instruments the main exposures are to the US dollar and euro and are due to loans, swaps and cash flow hedges on forecast receipts and payments.
A 5% 7.6 cent 2009 7.2 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 6.6 million 2009 3.7 million impact on operating profit and a 16.1 million 2009 19.1 million impact on equity for these instruments.
A 5% 5.6 cent 2009 5.4 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 6.8 million 2009 6.7 million impact on operating profit and a 21.2 million 2009 28.8 million impact on equity for these instruments.
However, the impact in operating profit relates primarily to the cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have occurred in the year and so would be offset by similar movements in the hedged items.
Similarly, the impact on equity relates primarily to foreign exchange positions used to hedge the subsidiaries net assets and so would be offset by an equal and opposite movement in the value of the relevant subsidiaries net assets.
The remaining impact on equity of 4.6 million 2009 6.6 million for the US dollar and 4.6 million 2009 8.1 million for the euro relates to cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have yet to occur.
29c Liquidity risk The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
At 31st March 2010 the group and parent company had borrowings under committed bank facilities of 50.0 million 2009 nil.
The group and parent company also have a number of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.

Annual Report & Accounts 2010 95 ACCOUNTS NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2010 29 Financial risk management continued 29d Credit risk Within certain businesses, the group and parent company derive a significant proportion of their revenue from sales to major customers.
Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price.
The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially impact the groups and parent companys results.
The group and parent company derive significant benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels.
Each business and division has a credit committee that regularly monitors its exposure.
The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken.
At 31st March 2010 trade receivables for the group amounted to 542.7 million 2009 408.2 million parent company 181.3 million 2009 160.4 million.
352.8 million 2009 224.8 million of these receivables at group level 130.0 million 2009 106.1 million at parent company level arose in Emission Control Technologies ECT which is part of Environmental Technologies Division and mainly supplies the automotive industry including car and truck manufacturers and component suppliers.
Although ECT has a wide spread of the available customers the concentrated nature of this industry means that amounts owed by individual customers can be large.
Other parts of the group tend to sell to a larger number of customers and amounts owed tend to be lower.
As at 31st March 2010 and at 31st March 2009 for the group as a whole, no single outstanding balance exceeded 1% of the groups revenue.
No assets have been taken possession of as collateral.
The credit profiles of the groups and parent companys customers are obtained from credit rating agencies and closely monitored.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
Generally, payments in the automotive industry and in the other markets in which the group operates are made promptly.
Trade receivables are considered impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are in financial difficulty or for other reasons which imply there is doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
Trade receivables can be analysed as: Group Parent company 2010 2009 2010 2009 million million million million Amounts neither past due nor impaired 476.5 333.3 165.2 143.7 Amounts past due but not impaired less than 30 days 47.7 52.7 13.6 14.3 30 90 days 13.6 12.8 3.2 2.9 more than 90 days 5.3 8.2 0.4 0.1 Total past due but not impaired 66.6 73.7 17.2 17.3 Amounts impaired 7.1 12.2 1.7 2.8 Specific allowances for bad and doubtful debts 5.5 9.2 0.9 2.2 Carrying amount of impaired receivables 1.6 3.0 0.8 0.6 General allowances for bad and doubtful debts 2.0 1.8 1.9 1.2 Trade receivables net of allowances 542.7 408.2 181.3 160.4 Movements in the allowances for impairments were: Group Parent company 2010 2009 2010 2009 million million million million At beginning of year 11.0 6.2 3.4 1.3 Charge for year 3.4 5.3 0.9 2.7 Release 3.0 0.7 0.5 0.1 Utilised 3.5 1.3 1.0 0.3 Disposal of business to subsidiary 0.2 Exchange adjustments 0.4 1.5 At end of year 7.5 11.0 2.8 3.4 Financial assets included in sundry receivables are all current and not impaired.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are banks with high credit ratings.
The exposure to individual banks is monitored frequently against internally defined limits together with the banks credit ratings and credit default swap prices.
As at 31st March 2010, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 27.0 million 2009 18.9 million for the group and 15.2 million 2009 9.8 million for the parent company, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for derivative financial instruments to a single bank was 9.9 million 2009 16.5 million for the group and parent company.
The group and parent company also use money market funds to invest surplus cash thereby further diversifying credit risk and at 31st March 2010 the group's and parent company's exposure to these funds was 40.0 million 2009 nil.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the groups and parent companys maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
The group guarantees its share of the borrowings and precious metal leases of its associate and its exposure at 31st March 2010 was nil 2009 nil.
The parent company also guarantees some of its subsidiaries borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, and precious metal leases and its exposure at 31st March 2010 was 16.2 million 2009 20.9 million.

It is not possible to determine reliably the fair value of the groups unquoted available-for-sale investments which have a book value of 7.5 million 2009 6.3 million as there is no active market.
These are investments in a company that is in the start up phase and in an investment vehicle that invests in start up companies and so there is a wide range of possible values.
Given their size it would be overly onerous to provide additional detail.
29f Capital management The groups policy for managing capital is to maintain an efficient balance sheet to ensure that the group always has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future growth.
The group has a long term target of net debt including post tax pension deficits to EBITDA of between 1.5 and 2.0 times although in any given year it may fall outside this range depending on future plans.
See the section on capital structure in the Financial Review on page 22 for more information.
