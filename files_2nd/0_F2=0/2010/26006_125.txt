Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include seed capital investments in funds and investments made through a subsidiary undertaking, Jupiter Investment Management Group Limited.
The fair values of quoted equity shares classified under level 1 are determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market.
Investments classified under level 2 are investments in non-quoted investment funds.
The fair value of a funds unit is determined to be a proportion of the net asset value of the fund.
If there are significant liquidity discounts applied e. g. when the funds have redemption gates or lock-up periods, the effect of the adjustments will be to put the fair value in level 3.
There is no such indication in investments classified under level 2 in 2010 for Group or Company.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
Derivatives are held to hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the price to exit the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value are included in the consolidated income statement.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its interest bearing loans and borrowings.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the consolidated income statement.

Total return swap The Group has entered into a total return swap arrangement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch over certain of its holdings of investments in seed funds.
Gains and losses on the swap contracts are recognised and settled monthly in accordance with the terms of the contract.
At 31 December 2010, the notional value of the swap was 38.7m 2009: 40.3m.
As the swap is settled and reset monthly, the fair value of the swap at 31 December 2010 was nil 2009: nil.
