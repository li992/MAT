Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2010 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts, issued in January 2009.
The Company adopted the extended disclosure requirements within FRS 29 for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The extended disclosure requirements introduced a fair value hierarchy and this is disclosed in note 18.
The financial statements have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends and convertibles are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are recognised as a capital item in the Income Statement.
expenses are charged to the capital reserve where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to the capital reserve to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital reserves and the revenue account on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year.
Murray Income Trust PLC 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued e Valuation of investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchanges electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the net return for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the capital reserve.
The valuation of reverse convertibles is carried out by the respective counterparty and is modelled on a long stock and short call basis taking account of implied volatility and including an accrual for yield.
f Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue expenses.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and are charged 50% to revenue and 50% to the capital reserve to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Traded options The Company may enter into certain derivatives eg options to gain exposure to the market.
The option contracts are accounted for as separate derivative contracts and are therefore shown in other assets or other liabilities at their fair value ie market value adjusted for the amortisation of transaction expenses.
The premium received and fair value changes in the open position are normally recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
However, where the option is written for the maintenance or enhancement of the Companys investments then the change in fair value is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
h Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business activity, being investment business.
Consequently, no business segmental analysis is provided.

The Company has not provided for deferred tax on capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments as it is exempt from tax on these items because of its status as an investment trust company.
The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 13,703,000 2009 13,961,000 arising as a result of unutilised management expenses and loan relationship deficits.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, liquid resources, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, subject to Board approval, for the purpose of managing currency and market risk arising from the Companys activities.
During the year the Company entered into three yield-enhanced securities reverse convertibles, details of which are provided in the Investment Portfolio table on page 15.
The main risks the Company faces from these financial instruments are i market risk comprising interest rate and other price risk, ii liquidity risk and iii credit risk.
The Company has minimal exposure to foreign currency risk as it holds only a small amount of foreign currency assets and has no exposure to any foreign currency liabilities.
In order to mitigate risk, the investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value.
Stock selection is therefore based on disciplined accounting, market and sector analysis.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
The Attribution Analysis, detailing the allocation of assets and the stock selection, is shown in the Sector Allocations table on page 7.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Current strategy is detailed in the Chairmans Statement on pages 4 and 5 in the sections headed Performance, Dividends and Outlook and in the Investment Managers Review on pages 6 to 9 in the sections headed Background, Performance, Portfolio Activity, Structure, Income and Outlook.
The Board has agreed the level of gearing, which was 9.9% of net assets as at 30 June 2010 2009 11.9%.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the current and previous year.
The numerical disclosures in the table listed below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Market price risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the investment objective as set out in the Corporate Summary on page 2.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowing powers set out in the management agreement mitigates the risk of exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Investment Managers Review on pages 6 to 9.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements.
It is the Boards policy to hold equity investments in the portfolio in a broad spread of sectors in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
A summary of investment changes during the year under review is on page 16 and an analysis of the equity portfolio by industrial classification is on pages 14 and 15.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: 48 Murray Income Trust PLC interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
Financial assets The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Floating rate Fixed rate Non-interest bearing 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 35,037 13,528 12,366 13,470 339,919 299,914 The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The interest bearing assets represent the equity linked notes and corporate bonds, amounting to 12,366,000 2009 13,470,000.
Their weighted average interest rate, based on current yield of the underlying equity, plus a fixed rate of interest on the nominal amount notes held, was 8.92% 2009 14.86%.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Financial liabilities The Company has borrowings by way of a loan facility, details of which are in note 11.
The fair value of the loan equates to the cost as the loans are rolled on a regular basis.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at their book value which in the opinion of the Directors is not materially different from their fair value.
Maturity profile The maturity profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 June was as follows: Within Within 1 year 1 year 2010 2009 000 000 Assets Fixed rate Equity linked notes 10,387 11,654 Floating rate Cash 35,037 13,528 More than More than 5 years 5 years 2010 2009 Assets 000 000 Fixed rate Corporate Bonds 1,979 1,816 Murray Income Trust PLC 49 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Within Within 1 year 1 year 2010 2009 Liabilities 000 000 Floating rate Revolving bank credit facility 35,000 35,000 All the other financial assets and liabilities do not have a maturity date.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and nonderivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant in the case of instruments that have floating rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Companys : profit before tax for the year ended 30 June 2010 would increase decrease by 350,000 2009 increase decrease by 135,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
equity reserves would not be materially affected as the fixed interest holdings held are linked to an underlying equity, and therefore covered under the other price risk section.
Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed in the section Investment Policy on page 2, both act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders and equity for the year ended 30 June 2010 would have increased decreased by 35,229,000 2009 31,338,000.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of committed loan and overdraft facilities.
As at 30 June 2010 the Company utilised 35,000,000 of a 45,000,000 revolving bank credit facility.
As at 30 June 2010 this rate was 2.21184% and the loan matured on 6 July 2010.
The aggregate of all future interest payments at the rate ruling at 30 June 2010 and the redemption of the loan amounts to 35,193,000. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Investment Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Investment Managers research of potential investee companies.
The Companys custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company and their performance is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis and reports its finding to the Managers Risk Management Committee.
It is the Managers policy to trade only with A and above Long Term rated and A1 P1 Short Term rated counterparties.
50 Murray Income Trust PLC None of the Companys financial assets is past due or impaired.
Capital management policies and procedures The investment objective of the Company is to achieve a high and growing income combined with capital growth through investment in a portfolio of UK equities.
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing which takes into account the Investment Managers views on the market: the level of equity shares in issue: the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
At the year end financial covenants contained within the loan agreements provide, inter alia, that borrowings shall at no time exceed 25% of net assets and that the net assets must exceed 225 million.
Fair value hierarchy The Company adopted the amendments to FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures effective from 1 January 2009.
These amendments require an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet are grouped into the fair value hierarchy at 30 June 2010 as follows: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Note 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Quoted equities a 339,919 339,919 Reverse convertibles b 1,979 10,387 12,366 Total 341,898 10,387 352,285 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives c 236 116 352 Net fair value 341,662 10,271 351,933 a Quoted equities The fair value of the Companys investments in quoted equities have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
Quoted equities included in Fair Value Level 1 are actively traded on recognised stock exchanges.
Murray Income Trust PLC 51 Notes to the Financial Statements continued b Quoted Bonds The fair value of the Companys investments in corporate quoted bonds have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
c Derivatives The fair value of the Companys investments in exchange traded options has been determined using quoted prices on an exchange traded basis and therefore have been classed as Level 1.
The fair value of the Companys investments in over-the-counter options has been determined using observable market inputs other than quoted prices and are therefore included within Level 2.
Contingent assets On 5 November 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that management fees on investment trusts should be exempt from VAT.
The Company has accepted the Managers offer to refund 818,000 to the Company, representing an estimate of VAT charged on investment management fees for the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003 which will be recoverable from HMRC: this has been received in the year and has been allocated to revenue and capital respectively, in accordance with the accounting policy of the Company for the periods in which the VAT was charged.
The sum of 1,556,000 in respect of VAT charged on investment management fees for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 August 2007 was both received and reflected in the previous accounting period.
The reclaim for previous periods along with interest due and the timescale for receipt are at present uncertain and the Company has therefore taken no account in these financial statements of any such repayment.
