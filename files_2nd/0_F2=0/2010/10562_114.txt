Pension costs The Morgan Pension Scheme and The Morgan Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme The Company participates in two defined benefit schemes in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trusteeadministered funds, The Morgan Pension Scheme MPS and The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SSS.
Given that the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the schemes have been accounted for in these financial statements as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The latest actuarial valuations of the MPS and the SSS were carried out as at 6 April 2009 and 1 April 2009 respectively, and updated for FRS 17 purposes to 31 December 2010 by a qualified independent actuary.
