These are issued to convert the proceeds of debt raised in foreign currency into sterling.
This broadly eliminates the impact of the revaluation of the debt which results from hedge accounting and consequently the restated net debt figure is a better representation of the groups debt obligations.
The amounts for 2006 have also been restated to exclude the results of discontinued operations Gearing has been calculated as net debt divided by the sum of equity and net debt.
