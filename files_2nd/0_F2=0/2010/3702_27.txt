Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The total expense recognised in the income statement of 30.8m 2009: 27.7m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
3.7m 2009: 11.9m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2010.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP, which is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members since 2003.
Special contributions of 7.9m were paid in 2010 2009: 5.5m to the CPP as agreed in connection with the disposal of the Fluid and Air group which completed in 2005.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2010 or 2009 for the defined benefit schemes.
Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries, the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2009.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2010.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
68 Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Group financial statements Business overview Corporate governance Group financial statements Other information The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2010 2009 UK Schemes USA Scheme UK Schemes USA Scheme Rate of increase in salary costs 4.09% 4.09% 4.13% 4.13% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 4.09% 4.09% 4.13% 4.13% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.39% 4.09% 4.13% 4.13% Discount rate 5.42% 5.54% 5.66% 5.91% Inflation assumption 3.59% 3.59% 3.63% 3.63% Expected return on scheme assets 6.25% 6.80% 6.65% 7.06% Pensions increase unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.59% n a 3.63% n a The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actual recent mortality experience of members within the scheme and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality assumption used in 2010 and 2009 is denoted by actuaries as PA92 year of birth projections long cohort.
In practical terms this is demonstrated in the table below: Further life expectancy Year of birth Year age 65 Male 1945 2010 23.8 years Male 1980 2045 25.4 years At 31 December 2010 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% 2009: 20% of their pension for cash at retirement.
This implies a full take-up of the permitted 25% 2009: 25% commutation by approximately 80% 2009: 80% of eligible members on retirement.
The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions is provided below: Increasing the discount rate by 0.1% would decrease scheme liabilities by 10.2m.
Increasing the inflation rate by 0.1% would increase scheme liabilities by 7.0m.
If each scheme member was expected to live for an additional year then scheme liabilities would increase by 10.4m.

The Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The Cobham Bonus Co-investment Plan BCP.
The PSP scheme allows for annual grants of conditional shares which vest 50% based on the Groups three year Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a sector comparator group and 50% based on the growth of the Groups underlying EPS over the same period.
Under the ESOS, options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the options are granted.
Exercise is conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three year period.
The scheme also includes a time-only section which is offered to participants based in the USA.
This allows for options to be granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary conditional only on continued employment within the Group.
The BCP scheme allows participants to defer up to 50% of their net earned annual performance bonus into Cobham shares in return for an opportunity to earn up to a 2:1 matching award of shares against the gross bonus invested, based on three-year Economic Profit growth targets.
A number of awards were made under the Cobham Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP up to 2006 and the final award under this scheme vested during 2009.
These awards were made at nil cost, vesting over a three year performance period based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a comparator group and also conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over the same period.
Further details of the above schemes can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 43 and 44.
In addition, entry to the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme ShareSave is available to all employees of participating UK subsidiaries.
Employees may purchase the Groups shares at 80% of the closing market price on the date of grant during a two-week period each year, up to a maximum contribution value of 3,000 in any one year.
The shares so purchased are generally placed in the employees share savings plan and will only be released to employees who remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years from the date of grant.
The rules of the BCP scheme allow for a matched award based on the gross amount of the bonus, dependent upon satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The exact amount of the entitlement will be ascertained upon vesting of the awards.
Under the LTIP, ESOS and ShareSave schemes, exercises were made at various times throughout the year.
The average share price in that period was 2.330 2009: 2.002.

com Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 73 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Cash settled share-based payment schemes During 2006 and 2007, the Group issued share appreciation rights SARs and awards under a phantom LTIP scheme to certain senior executives that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the award to the employee at the date of exercise.
These awards vested during 2009 and no further awards have been made under these schemes.
The expense for the year for the SAR and phantom LTIP rights is based on the fair value of the outstanding liability at the balance sheet date of 0.1m at 31 December 2010 2009: 0.4m, together with any additional amounts arising at the date of exercise.
SARs were granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the rights were granted.
As with the ESOS awards, exercise is conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three year period and is possible between three and five years after grant.
Phantom LTIP awards vested in full in 2009.

These were issued on 3 June 2008 and vest over a maximum of three years, based on the vesting date of the original options.
The latest vesting date is 9 January 2011.
The new awards were conditional only upon an employees continued employment to the vesting date.
The average exercise price based on the original options of each new right granted is 1.160.
The rights vest at a price linked to the market price of Cobham plcs shares with a minimum value at the date of vesting, based on the market value of Cobham plc shares on 3 June 2008, of 2.0925.
A portion of the fair value of the rights at the date of issue associated with pre-acquisition service was allocated to the cost of acquisition and the liability for this element has been included within provisions as contingent consideration.
The fair value of the total outstanding liability for these cash-settled awards at 31 December 2010 was insignificant 2009: 4.9m.

During 2009 the contingent consideration in respect of the purchase of Patriot Antenna Systems was reassessed, resulting in the generation of negative goodwill which was written back to the income statement in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
Additionally during 2009, the carrying value of intangible assets which arose on the acquisition of Patriot Antenna Systems was reassessed and additional amortisation of 2.6m was charged to the income statement.
This is included within the amortisation charge for the year as shown in note 12.
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated to approximately 50 cash generating units CGUs.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise.
For both the current and comparative years there have been no such exceptions.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and operating cash projections during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Groups time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
The Group annually prepares cash flow forecasts for the following five years at strategic business unit level and this is approved by management for the coming year.
The growth rate assumed after this five year period is based on long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The long-term projections used are in the range 2.5% to 3.0%.
The growth rates assume that demand for our products in the USA and in the UK remains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment in the long term future.
Taking into account our expectation of future market conditions we believe that the evolution of selling prices and direct costs will reflect past practices.
Where CGUs are at business unit level five year forecasts are not available and therefore the long-term growth projections are applied to the following years cash flow forecast.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.1% 2009: 10.6% having considered the country and currency risks in the principal territories in which the Group operates.
Following detailed review, no impairment losses have been recognised in the period.
The goodwill allocated to each of Cobham Analytic Solutions, M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Electronics in Lansdale are considered to be individually significant as they represent more than 10% of the Groups total goodwill carrying value.
After translation using year-end foreign exchange rates, these CGUs have 134.5m, 93.8m and 75.9m of goodwill respectively, representing 40.8% of the total balance.
Within the remaining 441.2m there are no other amounts considered individually significant.
Cobham Analytic Solutions, M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Electronics in Lansdale are all within the Cobham Defence Systems Division and they all operate primarily in the US defence market.
78 Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Group financial statements Business overview Corporate governance Group financial statements Other information The recoverable amounts associated with these goodwill balances have been determined on a value in use basis.
A value in use test requires comparison of asset carrying values with pre-tax cash flows.
Key assumptions and sensitivities are as follows: The five year plans for Cobham Analytic Solutions and one year plans for M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Electronics in Lansdale have been extrapolated in perpetuity using a long-term US GDP growth rate of 3.0% and discounted using the Groups discount rate.
A key assumption in deriving the growth rate is that market demand in the products and services provided by Cobham Analytic Solutions, M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Electronics in Lansdale grow broadly in line with the underlying economic environment for the foreseeable future.
The growth rate would need to decrease to -3.1%, 0.6% and 2.3% for Cobham Analytic Solutions, M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Electronics in Lansdale respectively in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
Sensitivity analysis has determined that the discount rate of 10.1% is an influential assumption on the outcome of the recoverable amount calculation.
The recoverable amounts of Cobham Analytic Solutions, M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Electronics in Lansdale exceed the total carrying value of assets for the CGU by US$220.6m, US$82.1m and US$19.4m respectively: the discount rate would need to increase to 14.1%, 12.5% and 10.8% for Cobham Analytic Solutions, M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Electronics in Lansdale respectively in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
Sensitivity analysis has also been performed on the operating cash flow projections.
Cash flows can be impacted by changes to sales projections, sales prices and direct costs.
In order for the carrying value of goodwill for Cobham Analytic Solutions, M A-COM and Cobham Sensor Electronics in Lansdale to be impaired the expected cash flows for every year would need to reduce by 37%, 25% and 8% respectively.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

These were all settled in 2010.
Contingent consideration relating to business combinations completed after 1 January 2010 is included as a financial liability and shown in note 21.
Provisions for contingent consideration were made where it is considered probable that the conditions applicable to the payment of contingent consideration would be met.
The amount provided is therefore the amount considered likely to be payable.
Arrangements of this nature varied, but typically extended for up to five years and were discounted where payable after two years.
The provision at 31 December 2009 was not discounted although the unwinding of discounts in the year to 31 December 2009 resulted in a finance charge of 0.1m.
Any reassessments of these provisions are accounted for as adjustments to goodwill.
Under current IFRS standards addition to, or release of, contingent consideration provisions in periods after the completion of the related transaction were regarded as purchase price adjustments and are accounted for as adjustments to goodwill see note 13.
Warranty claims The warranty provision represents managements best estimate of the Groups liability under warranties granted on products sold, based on past experience and industry averages for defective products.
It is anticipated that most of these costs will be incurred in the next financial year.
Contract loss provisions Contract loss provisions represent managements best estimate of the amount by which the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under those contracts.
The timeframe within which such provisions will unwind varies by contract, but is generally within one year.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on leased operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months, and where specific conditions exist regarding the state of a leased aircraft on its return to the lessor at the end of the lease.
Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft and are credited to the provision.
The provision is then utilised by absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity or on incurring the expenditure required to return the aircraft to the state of maintenance required before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
com Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 85 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Provisions on business disposals These provisions include amounts provided in respect of the divestment of MTS in 2009 and warranties given on the disposals of the Countermeasures operations and the Fluid and Air group in 2005.
All amounts have been determined based on managements current estimates of likely outcomes.
Due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of settlement of these items, they have been disclosed as due within one year.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 403.9m 2009: 407.8m.

The carrying value of trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities are assumed to approximate to their fair values due to their short term nature.
IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
All financial instruments measured at fair value in the table above are classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been determined using significant inputs which are based on observable market data.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, fixed rate loans and finance leases have been determined by the use of valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, based on assumptions that are supported by observable market prices or rates.
As at 31 December 2010, the fair value of the fixed rate senior notes is 394.7m 2009: 377.7m.

Financial instruments and risk management The Groups multi-national operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt, and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Financial instruments The Group finances its operations primarily through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use derivative financial instruments these are put in place to manage the currency financing risks and interest rate risks arising from normal operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk and interest rate risk are the most significant exposures for the Group for which financial instruments are employed as mitigation.
The Group is exposed to other risks such as liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other European countries, Australia and Canada.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
All currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The carrying amounts of the Groups total foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities, translated at the relevant year-end exchange rate, are as follows: 2010 2009 m US$ AUS$ US$ AUS$ Monetary assets 268.8 86.7 85.3 316.3 76.8 58.8 Monetary liabilities 882.9 37.8 109.5 872.1 47.6 98.8 Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Groups overseas net assets.
The Group typically borrows US dollars to fund acquisitions in the USA and uses intercompany debt to create a natural economic hedge.
The following borrowings included in monetary liabilities in the table above and foreign exchange contracts match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets: m 2010 2009 US dollar borrowings 526.9 699.7 US dollar foreign exchange contracts 161.0 172.8 On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries which includes monetary assets and liabilities shown in the tables above are translated at closing exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in other comprehensive income and the translation reserve note 30.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the income statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and through the use of forward contracts.
The sterling US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as the Group is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which non US based subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities, and the proportion of the Group based in the USA.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
It is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts by its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars outstanding as at 31 December: US$ amount Average US$: exchange rate million 2010 2009 2010 2009 Expiring within one year 182.7 176.6 1.56 1.59 Expiring within one to two years 52.4 78.8 1.60 1.57 Expiring after two years 83.1 32.0 1.61 1.68 318.2 287.4 1.58 1.59 The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is December 2014. www.
com Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 91 Notes to the Group financial statements continued The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currencies.
The sensitivities below represent managements assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates, based on experience over the previous five years.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the financial year.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant and includes the effect of derivative financial instruments.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and total equity.

In order to provide comparable information, sensitivity has also been assessed based on a 10% weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency, as follows: 2010 2009 m Sensitivity Profit loss Total equity Sensitivity Profit loss Total equity US dollars 10% 14.2 14.2 10% 13.2 13.2 Euros 10% 5.6 5.6 10% 6.3 6.3 Australian dollars 10% 0.1 0.1 10% Interest rate risk The Group has various long and short term borrowings, principally in US dollars and Australian dollars at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group continually monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to use interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.
Interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on floating rate debt are all designated as cash flow hedges and are as follows: Period of swap contract 2010 2009 Hedged item Fixed rate from to Currency value m m US dollar loans 3.22% June 2010 June 2013 US$260.0m 166.1 161.0 3.49% March 2008 March 2013 US$139.0m 88.8 86.1 3.61% August 2008 August 2013 US$211.0m 134.8 130.7 Australian dollar loans 6.30% May 2006 January 2020 AUS$82.7m 54.1 50.6 6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$16.1m 10.5 9.9 Surplus funds are placed on short term fixed rate deposits and as such also give rise to interest rate exposure.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a change of 1.0% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables, including foreign currency exchange rates, held constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and total equity where interest rates rise.
A fall in interest rates would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

For short term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement.
In the US a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with their lenders.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities and the use of the Groups revolving credit facility which expires in July 2012.
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.
2010 2009 m Within one year 15 years Over 5 years Within one year 15 years Over 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 220.8 26.4 2.7 218.5 16.1 2.8 Borrowings 316.0 214.9 268.4 402.9 212.2 164.2 Contingent consideration included within provisions 4.1 Derivative contracts: Gross cash outflows 74.8 151.8 56.1 133.0 Gross cash inflows 59.2 127.4 43.3 110.7 0.3 In addition, and to provide flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity, it is the Groups policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in various currencies.
The following facilities, which are at floating rates, were available at 31 December: m 2010 2009 Expiring within one year 46.6 48.4 Expiring between one and five years 65.4 46.6 113.8 Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is minimal because the counterparties are banks with satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group further limits risk in this area by setting a maximum level for deposits or overdrafts with any one counterparty.
These facilities are reviewed periodically and also if there is an indication that the credit rating of any of the Groups core banks has fallen below a Moodys Aa3 rating.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long-term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are also monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impaired receivables.
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2010, 6.1% 2009: 6.2% of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2010 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 18. Letters of credit are the only collateral held as security against trade receivables.
These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice and secure less than 1.0m of receivables.
The Group has pledged assets only in respect of finance leases and bank accounts as disclosed in notes 14 and 19.
No assets have been pledged in respect of any of the Groups primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities.
In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the financial statements.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
com Cobham plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 93 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Capital risk management Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total shareholders equity, excluding non-controlling interests, totalling 1,075.8m at 31December 2010 2009: 948.0m, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an optimum capital structure by a mixture of debt and retained earnings.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant acquisition is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, future funding needs usually potential acquisitions and proposed dividend levels.
Group banking arrangements are also considered, these include financial covenants which are based on adjusted IFRS results.
This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic climate, continues to be considered appropriate.
There have been no breaches of the terms of the Group banking arrangements or defaults during the current or comparative periods.
During the year, additional funding has been secured through private placements.

Contingent liabilities and commitments At 31 December 2010, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group consolidated financial statements.
As the conditions of these guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no provision has been made at the year end.
The Company has also committed, in connection with the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project, to invest 6.0m in the equity share capital of three companies and to provide additional funding of 18.1m in the form of redeemable loan notes by March 2013 at the latest.

The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims and management do not anticipate that the outcome of these, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The group has recently identified and is reviewing the circumstances surrounding one, more significant, contractual breach dating back some years.
The contract was in respect of goods provided into a geographic market which represents only a small amount of revenue for the group.
The outcome cannot be estimated at this stage and resolution may take some time.
As it could be prejudicial, no further information is disclosed.
