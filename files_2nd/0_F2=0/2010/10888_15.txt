Financial risk continued e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the UK Retail Prices Index.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant, and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The assumptions made in calculating the sensitivity analysis are as per those for NGG as a whole and have therefore no further information has been provided in this appendix The following table shows the illustrative impact on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in the UK Retail Prices Index and UK interest rates, after the effects of tax.
