Annual Report 2010 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies the AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
b Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are set out in the Business Review section of the Directors Report on pages 6 to 17.
The financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2010 is shown in the balance sheet on page 45.
The cash flows of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2010, which are not untypical, are set out on page 46.
The Company had fixed debt and preference share capital totalling 110,246,000, as set out in note 13 on page 57: none of the borrowings is repayable before 2016.
The Group had no short term borrowings at 31 December 2010 but shortly before the year end put in place a one year secured multi-currency borrowing facility for 50 million.
Note 14 on pages 57 to 64 sets out the Groups risk management policies and procedures, including those covering currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
As at 31 December 2010 the Groups total assets less current liabilities exceeded its total non current liabilities by a multiple of over ten.
The assets of the Group consist mainly of securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment policy, as set out on page 11.
Most of these securities are readily realisable even in volatile markets.
The directors, who have reviewed carefully the Groups budget and forecast for the coming year, consider that the Group has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups accounts.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entity controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiary to bring the accounting policies used by it into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
d Presentation of the Statement of Comprehensive Income In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 formerly section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. e Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available, dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short term deposits is accrued to the end of the period.
Stock lending fees and underwriting commission are recognised as earned.
Where the Group has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of shares received over the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
47 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued f Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fees and finance costs are allocated 25% to revenue and 75% to capital to reflect the Boards expectations of long term investment returns.
Any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reflecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or disposal of investments are included in the costs of acquisition or deducted from the proceeds of sale as appropriate and included in capital reserves.
g Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
h Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
All the Groups investments are defined by IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
All gains and losses are allocated to the capital return within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price, the bid price or the single price as appropriate, released by the relevant investment manager.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or for investments for which there is only an inactive market, are established by using various valuation techniques.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and reference to similar quoted companies.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
The subsidiary company, Witan Investment Services Limited, is held at fair value.
This is considered to be the net asset value of the shareholders funds, as shown in its balance sheet.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
48 Annual Report 2010 1 Accounting policies continued j Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are not recognised until approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
k Non current liabilities All debentures and secured bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with the interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future payments over the expected life of the financial liabilities, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
l Foreign currency translation Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are fair valued and denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and allocated to the capital return.
m Adoption of new and revised accounting standards i Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
ii Amendments and improvements to IFRSs The amendments and improvements to the following standards, effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010 unless otherwise stated, have not had any impact on the accounting policies or the financial position of the Group or the Company during the year.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008 and IAS 27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements effective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
IAS 32 Amendment Classification of Rights Issues effective for periods commencing on or after 1 February 2010 IAS 39 Amendment Eligible Hedged Items effective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009 IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners effective for periods commencing on or after 1 November 2009 for EU-IFRS IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments effective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2010 n Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risks arising from the Companys investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings and futures contracts on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio to provide additional market exposure or to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the investment managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies as approved by the Board, which has set written principles for the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The difference is explained below.
Year ended 31 December 2010 Year ended 31 December 2009 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net profit on ordinary activities before taxation 20,444 158,250 178,694 24,851 186,312 211,163 Corporation tax at 28% 2009: 28% 5,724 44,310 50,034 6,958 52,167 59,125 Effects of: Non-taxable UK dividends 3,244 3,244 3,839 3,839 Non-taxable stock dividends 26 26 Non-taxable overseas dividends 4,396 4,396 1,306 1,306 Withholding tax written off 1,677 1,677 1,546 1,546 Double tax relief 2,058 2,058 Income taxable in different years 2 2 187 187 Write off of overseas tax reclaimable 38 38 58 58 Non taxable gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss 47,512 47,512 55,128 55,128 Excess management expenses not utilised in period 2,899 2,899 1,282 1,282 Unused loan relationship deficits for the period 2,168 2,168 1,740 1,740 Preference dividends not deductible in determining taxable profit 23 23 23 23 Capitalised expenses 3,176 3,202 26 2,238 2,238 Current tax charge credit 1,715 1,715 2,327 723 1,604 c Deferred tax Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2009: nil.
d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 23,857,000 2009: 19,178,000 arising as a result of having unrelieved loan relationship deficits and eligible unrelieved foreign tax.
It is unlikely that the Company will obtain relief for these in the future so no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Total in respect of the year: Set out below is the total dividend to be paid in respect of the year.
This is the basis on which the requirements of section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are considered.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 000 000 Revenue profits available for distribution 18,729 22,524 First interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 4.40p 2009: 4.30p per ordinary share 8,665 9,162 Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 6.50p 2009: 6.20p per ordinary share 12,654 12,407 Revenue deficit surplus for the year 2,590 955 9 Earnings per ordinary share The earnings per ordinary share figure is based on the net profit for the year of 176,979,000 2009: 209,559,000 and on 198,139,038 ordinary shares 2009: 211,898,833, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The earnings per ordinary share figure detailed above can be further analysed between revenue and capital, as below.
The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share.
Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.
iii Gains on investments held at fair value though profit or loss Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 000 000 Realised gains losses on sales of investments 75,429 29,456 Movement in investment holding gains 92,563 229,309 Realised loss on buy-backs of secured bonds and debenture stock 2,038 Net movement on foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents 1,694 930 169,686 196,885 55 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 10 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss continued iv Substantial share interests The Company has notified interests in 3% or more of the voting rights of three of the investee companies, all of which are closed-ended investment funds.
However, the Board does not consider any of the Companys investments to be individually material in the context of these financial statements.
It is the Companys stated policy to invest no more than 15% of its gross assets in other listed investment companies including listed investment trusts.
v Unquoted investments The value of the unquoted investments as at 31 December 2010 was 962,000 2009: 7,095,000 and the portfolio comprised the following holdings: Valuation Investments 000 Cazenove Capital Holdings Limited 780 HarbourVest put option 182 962 Cazenove Capital Holdings Limited is an asset management business which split away from Cazenove Group in 2005.
The holding is valued on the basis of an independent valuation of the company that was used in May 2010 to set the price for a tender offer to the companys shareholders: the directors consider this price to be supported by information about the companys business over the remainder of 2010.

Secured Bonds due 2025, net of discount and issue costs totalling approximately 2,000,000.
The discount and the issue costs will be written back over the life of the Secured Bonds.
The nominal value of the remaining Secured Bonds in issue 64,290,000 at 31 December 2010 is redeemable on 15 December 2025.
The nominal value of the Debenture Stock is redeemable on 1 October 2016.
The Debenture Stock and the Secured Bonds are secured by floating charges over all the undertaking and assets of the Company.
The security of the charges applies pari passu to both issues.
14 Financial instruments Risk management policies and procedures As an investment company, Witan invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks, market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to manage the risks, as set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period, although in some instances additional resources have been allocated to some areas.
14.1 Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises: price risk see note 14.2, currency risk see note 14.3 and interest rate risk see note 14.4.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 31 December 2009.
The investment managers assess the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of their investment portfolios on an ongoing basis.
14.2 Price risk Price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolios by regularly reviewing relevant information from the investment managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the managers compliance with their mandates and also whether each mandate and asset allocation is compatible with Witans objective.
When appropriate, Witan has the ability to manage its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on indices and on equity investments in its portfolios.
57 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 14 Financial instruments continued The Companys exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December on its quoted and unquoted equity investments, and on options on indices and investments, was as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,203,675 1,074,189 Concentration of exposure to price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on page 18.
This shows that the greater geographical weighting is to UK companies, with significant exposure also to North America and Continental Europe.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those regions, although an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of the shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Companys equity investments including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and equity exposure through options at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable, given that most of the Companys assets are equity investments.

As a consequence, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The investment managers monitor their exposure to currencies as part of their normal investment processes.
The Board receives a monthly report on the currency exposures of the entire fund.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling upon receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 December are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the Companys equity in regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable in the context of the majority of the Companys assets being invested overseas.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar - 15% 2009: 15% Euro - 15% 2009: 15% Japanese yen - 15% 2009: 15% These percentages have been determined by taking in each case the highest range seen in each of the last seven calendar years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
If sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2010 2009 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 580 928 353 555 960 333 Capital return 44,683 30,168 5,018 35,868 33,379 17,282 Change to the profit after tax 45,263 31,096 5,371 36,423 34,339 17,615 Change to the shareholders funds 45,263 31,096 5,371 36,423 34,339 17,615 59 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 14 Financial instruments continued If sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2010 2009 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 429 686 261 410 709 246 Capital return 33,026 22,298 3,709 26,511 24,672 12,774 Change to the profit after tax 33,455 22,984 3,970 26,921 25,381 13,020 Change to the shareholders funds 33,455 22,984 3,970 26,921 25,381 13,020 In the opinion of the directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently, as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objective.
14.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from fixed interest securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company holds significant cash balances, partially to meet payments as they fall due but also to offset the long term borrowings that it has in place.
The Company finances part of its activities through preference shares that do not have redemption dates and through debenture stock and secured bonds that were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December 2010 of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due be repaid.
The Companys exposure to floating interest rates on assets is 52,510,000 2009: 58,638,000.
The Companys exposure to fixed interest rates is 11,822,000 2009: 665,000.
The Companys exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 110,246,000 2009: 110,166,000.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2009: same : the finance charge on the preference shares is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% 2009: 3.3% : the finance charge on the debenture stock is at a weighted average interest rate of 8.5% 2009: 8.5% : and the finance charge on the secured bonds is at a weighted average interest rate of 6.125% 2009: 6.125%.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, long term debt is partially redeemed and as the level of cash balances varies during the year.
In the context of the Companys balance sheet, the exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be material.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Companys monetary financial instruments at each balance sheet date, an increase or decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates would decrease or increase revenue return after tax by 1,050,000 2009: 845,000, capital return after tax by nil 2009: 328,000, and total profit after tax and shareholders funds by 1,050,000 2009: 1,173,000.
60 Annual Report 2010 14 Financial instruments continued This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as investments are made.
In the context of the Companys balance sheet, the outcome is not considered to be material.
14.5 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has borrowed 44,589,000 by its issue in 1986 of 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2016 and 63,102,000 by its issue in 2000 of 6.125 per cent Secured Bonds due 2025.
The Company is able to draw short term borrowings of up to the sterling equivalent of 50 million from its secured and committed multi-currency borrowing facility of 50 million with BNP Paribas, London Branch expiring on 12 December 2011.
No borrowings were drawn down under the facility at 31 December 2010 there was no such facility in place in 2009.
The Board gives guidance to the investment managers as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December 2010, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, was as follows: 2010 2009 Within Between More than Within Between More than 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 3,790 15,160 47,432 3,790 15,160 51,222 Secured bonds 3,938 15,751 103,495 3,938 15,751 107,433 Preference shares 83 332 2,555 83 332 2,555 Other creditors and accruals 9,160 5,820 16,971 31,243 153,482 13,631 31,243 161,210 The above figures show interest payable over the remaining terms of each instrument.
The figures in the more than 5 years columns also include the capital to be repaid.
The figures in the more than 5 years columns do not include the ongoing annual finance cost of 83,000.
14.6 Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the investment managers, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past their due dates or impaired.

Note 1 h on page 48 sets out the Boards policy for determining the fair values of the unquoted investments.
The directors are of the opinion that changing one or more of those assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change those fair values significantly.
The amount of change in fair value for such investments recognised in the profit or loss for the year was a profit of 248,000 2009: 3,645,000.
Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2010 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 1,150,768 780 1,151,548 Investments in other funds 51,945 51,945 Derivatives 182 182 Total 1,150,768 51,945 962 1,203,675 62 Annual Report 2010 14 Financial instruments continued Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2009 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 993,194 7,095 1,000,289 Investments in other funds 73,900 73,900 Derivatives 194 194 Total 993,388 73,900 7,095 1,074,383 Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies in note 1 h. There were no transfers during the year between Level 1 and Level 2.
A reconciliation of fair value measurements in Level 3 is set out below.
Level 2 Financial assets Level 2 Financial assets refer to an investment in Trilogy Emerging Markets Fund 2009: two Open Ended Investment Company investments managed by Henderson Global Investors North America and Orbis Investment Management Australasia.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Companys policy is to manage the effective gearing in the portfolio to not normally exceed 20%.
Effective gearing is defined to be the total market value of investments less shareholders funds as a percentage of shareholders funds.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Chief Executive Officers view on the market: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium : and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
63 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 14 Financial instruments continued The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: the terms of issue of the Companys debenture stock and secured bonds require the aggregate amount outstanding in respect of borrowings, measured in accordance with the policies used to prepare the annual financial statements, not to exceed a sum equal to the Companys capital and reserves at any time: as a public company, the Company has a minimum issued share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.
