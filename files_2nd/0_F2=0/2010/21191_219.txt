The preference share capital of the Company at 31 December 2010 was: 2010 2009 m m Issued and paid up 3 100,000,000 8 % cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 8 3 100,000,000 8 % cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 4 200 200 The Companies Act 2006 abolished the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital and the articles of association adopted by the Company on 28 April 2010 reflect this.
Directors will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any time allot because the allotment authority continues to be required under the act.
Under the Companys articles of association, the Company may issue and allot Sterling New Preference Shares and Euro New Preference Shares, which, if issued and allotted, would rank, as to payment of a dividend and capital, ahead of the Companys ordinary share capital but behind the cumulative irredeemable preference shares currently in issue.
The issued preference shares are non-voting except where their dividends are in arrears, on a winding up or where their rights are altered.
On a winding up, they carry a preferential right of return of capital ahead of the ordinary shares.
The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.
