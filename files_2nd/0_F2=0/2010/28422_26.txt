376 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES ON THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES ON THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS Prudential plc the Company is a parent holding company.
The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with its principal operations in the UK, the US and Asia.
The Group operates in the UK through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, Prudential Annuities Limited, Prudential Retirement Income Limited and M&G Investment Management Limited.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
The Group also has operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and other Asian countries.
The Company is responsible for the nancing of each of its subsidiaries.
2: BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the balance sheet and related notes, are prepared in accordance with Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006, which applies to companies generally.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including Financial Reporting Standards FRS and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP.
The Company has not prepared a cash ow statement on the basis that its cash ow is included within the cash ow statement in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, from the requirements of this standard on the basis that the Companys results are included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of the Group that include disclosures that comply with IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which is equivalent to FRS 29.
The amendments to FRS 20 Group cash settled share-based payment transactions which expanded FRS 2 to bring into scope group cash-settled share-based payment transactions became effective for the Company in 2010.
These amendments incorporated the guidance in UITF 41, Scope of FRS 20 and UITF 44, Group and Treasury Share Transactions which were withdrawn as a result.
In particular, the amendments specify that the entity which has the obligation to settle the share-based payment arrangement shall recognise it as an equity-settled transaction if it is settled in its own equity instruments and as cash-settled transaction otherwise, no matter which entity in the Group receives the goods or service in the arrangement.
The Companys share-based payment accounting treatment prior to 2010 was consistent with these amendments and accordingly, there was no impact on the Companys results and financial position upon the adoption of these amendments.
In addition, following the UK Governments announcement in July 2010 of the use of the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI in its determination of the statutory minimum pension increases for private sector occupational pension schemes, in December 2010, the ASBs Urgent Issues Task Force UITF published its abstract UITF 48 providing guidance on the accounting implications of the change.
See note 9 for further details.
Further, in 2010, the Company adopted the Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2009, the Amendment to FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising On Liquidation.
Their adoption had no material impact on the financial statements of the Company.
3: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings Loans to subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage interest rate and currency exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Under FRS 26, hedge accounting is permissible only if certain criteria are met regarding the establishment of documentation and continued measurement of hedge effectiveness.
For derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, the movements in the fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the accompanying change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity, or, for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PARENT COMPANY 377 Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are also converted at year end exchange rates with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses reected in the profit and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to reect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each le separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups largest pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS and applied the requirements of FRS 17 as amended in December 2006 to its interest in the PSPS surplus or deficit.
Further details are disclosed in note 9.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The Companys share of pension surplus is recognised to the extent that the Company is able to recover a surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the dened benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash ows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the unwind of the discount on liabilities at the start of the period, gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, less the expected investment return on the scheme assets at the start of the period, is recognised in the profit and loss account.
To the extent that part or all of the Companys interest in the pension surplus is not recognised as an asset, the unrecognised surplus is initially applied to extinguish any past service costs, losses on settlements or curtailments that would otherwise be included in the profit and loss account.
Next, the expected investment return on the schemes assets is restricted so that it does not exceed the total of the current service cost, interest cost and any increase in the recoverable surplus.
Any further adjustment for the unrecognised surplus is treated as an actuarial gain or loss.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, the difference between actual and expected investment return on scheme assets and experience variances are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Actuarial gains and losses also include adjustment for unrecognised pension surplus as described above.
Share-based payments The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled plans with a few cash-settled plans.
Under FRS 20, where the Company, as the parent company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in the subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.
The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.

The tables below provide a reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS.
2010 m 2009 m PROFIT AFTER TAX profit for the financial year of the Company in accordance with UK GAAP 881 913 IFRS adjustment 8 5 profit for the financial year of the Company including dividends from subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 873 908 Share in the IFRS profit loss of the Group, net of distributions to the Company 558 232 PROFIT AFTER TAX OF THE GROUP ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS 1,431 676 2010 m 2009 m NET EQUITY Shareholders equity of the Company in accordance with UK GAAP 4,267 3,826 IFRS adjustment 51 53 Shareholders equity of the Company in accordance with IFRS 4,216 3,773 Share in the IFRS net equity of the Group 3,815 2,498 SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF THE GROUP IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS 8,031 6,271 The profit for the financial year of the Company in accordance with UK GAAP and IFRS includes dividends declared in the year from subsidiary undertakings of 1,318 million and 1,039 million for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The IFRS adjustment lines in the above tables represent the difference in the accounting treatment for pension schemes between UK GAAP and IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, the parent companys interest in the surplus of one of the pension schemes recognised on the balance sheet represents the element which is recoverable through reduced future contributions.
Under IFRS, as the terms of the relevant trust deed restrict shareholders access to any underlying surplus, not only is the underlying IAS 19 basis surplus not recognised, but the Companys share of the obligation for deficit funding has also to be recognised on the balance sheet.
The shares in the IFRS profit and net equity of the Group represent the Companys equity in the earnings and net assets of its subsidiaries and associates.
As stated in note 3, under UK GAAP, the Company accounts for its investments in subsidiary undertakings at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
For the purpose of this reconciliation, no adjustment is made to the Company in respect of any valuation adjustments to shares in subsidiary undertakings which would be eliminated on consolidation.

ii The 20 million borrowings were issued at 20-year Euro Constant Maturity Swap capped at 6.5 per cent.
These borrowings have been swapped into borrowings of 14 million with interest payable at three month LIBOR plus 1.2 per cent.
iii The US$250 million 6.75 per cent borrowings and the US$300 million 6.5 per cent borrowings can be converted, in whole or in part, at the Companys option and subject to certain conditions, on any interest payment date falling on or after 23 March 2010 and 23 March 2011, respectively into one or more series of Prudential preference shares.
iv Interest on the US$300 million 6.5 per cent borrowings was swapped into floating rate payments but, in 2008, swapped back into fixed rate payments of 6.5 per cent until September 2010.
Upon the maturity of the floating to fixed swap in September 2010, the fixed to floating swap was also cancelled.
Hedge accounting was applied at both the Group consolidated level and Company level until the cancellation of the fixed to floating interest rate of swap of the US$300 million 6.5 per cent borrowings in September 2010.
Due to different dates of commencement of this accounting treatment, the hedge values differed between these two levels.
v These borrowings support a short-term fixed income securities programme.
vi The Company issued 200 million Floating Rate Notes in 2010 which mature in April 2011.
All Notes have been subscribed to by a Group subsidiary and accordingly have been eliminated on consolidation in the Group financial statements.
These Notes were originally issued in October 2008 and have been reissued upon their maturity.
vii The interests of the holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Capital Securities are subordinate to the entitlements of other creditors of the Company.

The derivative financial instruments are valued internally using standard market practices.
In accordance with the Companys risk management framework, all internally generated valuations are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
9: PENSION SCHEME FINANCIAL POSITION The majority of UK Prudential staff are members of the Groups pension schemes.
The largest scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme which is primarily a closed dened benefit scheme.
At 31 December 2010, on the FRS 17, Retirement Benets basis of valuation, the underlying pension liabilities of the Scheme accounted for 86 per cent 2009: 86 per cent of the liabilities of the Groups dened benefit schemes.
For the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, the Group applies IFRS basis accounting including IAS 19, Employee Benets.
However, the individual accounts of the Company continue to follow UK GAAP including FRS 17.
The FRS 17 disclosures are aligned with IAS 19.
Under IFRS, the Group applies IFRIC 14, interpretation guidance to IAS 19 with the effect of derecognising the Groups interest in the Schemes surplus and recognising an additional liability for the deficit funding obligation for the Scheme in the Group financial statements.
Further details are described in note I3 Staff and pension plans of the notes on the financial statements of the Group.
At 31 December 2005, the allocation of surpluses and deficits attaching to the Scheme between the Company and the unallocated surplus of the Prudential Assurance Companys PAC with-profits funds was apportioned in the ratio 30 70 between the Company and the PAC with-profits fund following detailed consideration of the sourcing of previous contributions.
This ratio was applied to the base deficit position at 1 January 2006 and for the purpose of determining the allocation of the movements in that position up to 31 December 2010.
The FRS 17 service charge and ongoing employer contributions are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
Dened benefit schemes are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuation every three years to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes having regard to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
The Scheme was last actuarially valued as at 5 April 2008 using the projected unit method.
The next triennial valuation of the Scheme is scheduled to take place as at 5 April 2011.
The 2008 valuation demonstrated the Scheme to be 106 per cent funded by reference to the Scheme Solvency Target that forms the basis of the Schemes statutory funding objective.
Accordingly, the total contributions to be made by the Group to the Scheme, representing the annual accrual cost and deficit funding, were reduced from the previous arrangement of 70-75 million per annum to 50 million per annum effective from 1 July 2009.
As the Scheme was in a surplus position at the valuation date, no formal recovery plan was required.
However, recognising that there had been a significant deterioration in the value of the Schemes assets from 5 April 2008 to the date of the nalisation of the valuation, an additional funding akin to deficit funding was agreed with the Scheme Trustees subject to a reassessment when the next valuation is completed.
In 2010, total contributions for the year, including expenses and augmentations, were 55 million 2009: 67 million.
Using external actuarial advice provided by the professionally qualied actuaries, Towers Watson, for the valuation of the Scheme, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2010 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.

In July 2010, the UK Government announced plans to use the Consumer Price Index CPI in place of the Retail Price Index RPI in its determination of the statutory minimum pension increases for private sector occupational pension schemes.
In December 2010, the Government published the statutory revaluation order for 2011 which confirms the change to use CPI.
In addition, the Government has also published in December 2010 a consultation paper which sets out the Governments views on the impact that the switch from RPI to CPI will have on the private sector occupational pension schemes.
The consultation period closed on 2 March 2011.
Only those tranches of the Scheme which are subject to statutory increases in accordance with the Scheme rules may be affected by the Governments decision to change the indexation from RPI to CPI.
Other tranches of the Scheme are unaffected.
In line with the guidance of UITF 48, the above has no impact on the results for the year ended 31 December 2010.
For the Governments announcement to have had an effect on the 2010 results, it would have been necessary for communication of the altered arrangement to have been made to the members of the schemes for which benets are paid by reference to RPI, as a constructive obligation.
No such communication has been completed.
Accordingly, the Company has not recognised this change for the year ended 31 December 2010.
The impact of the change, if and when made, will be recognised in a future period.
However, as the Company is only able to recognise a restricted FRS 17 surplus for the Scheme, any reduction in the underlying Scheme liabilities has no effect on the profit or shareholders funds of the Company.
Further details of the Scheme, including mortality assumptions, are shown in note I3 Staff and pension plans of the notes on the financial statements of the Group.
