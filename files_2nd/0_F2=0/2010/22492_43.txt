Close Brothers Group plc Annual Report 2010 77 Goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at least annually using value in use calculations.
This calculation typically uses discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent budgets and three year plans to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU.
For cash flows beyond the groups three year planning horizon, a terminal value was calculated using an annual growth rate of 3% for each CGU, except where circumstances warrant a different rate.
The resulting cash flows were then discounted using a rate of 12.2%, which represents the groups estimated weighted average cost of capital of 9%, grossed up by the group effective tax rate, which management feels is appropriate due to the use of pre-tax operating cash flows in the model.
As a result of our value in use calculations an impairment charge of 6.5 million has been recognised in Asset Management in response to continuing difficult trading conditions.
The cash flows used in these value in use calculations are sensitive to the impact of changes in the assumptions for profit before tax, discount rates, and long-term growth rates.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions which have been used would not lead the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
