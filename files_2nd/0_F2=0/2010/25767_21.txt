Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The disclosures on going concern on page 23 of the Directors Report form part of these accounts.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off in the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, performance fees and other capital receivables and payables are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end, unrealised gains and losses on the forward foreign currency contract and unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities together with any premiums or discounts on purchase are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Stock lending income is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the following exceptions: performance fees are allocated 100% to capital.
management fees are allocated 20% to revenue and 80% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 20 on page 48.

Annual Report & Accounts 2010 American pp38 57 American pp38 57 09 03 2011 15:55 Page 39 e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 20% to revenue and 80% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debenture in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss as they arise.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included in the income statement as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
h Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is allocated to capital.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
i Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, final dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
j VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
VAT recoverable is calculated using the partial exemption method based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge in the year 2010 2009 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 1 UK corporation tax at 28% 2009: 28% 520 520 Double taxation relief 520 520 Overseas withholding tax 996 996 1,008 1,008 Tax attributable to expenses and finance costs charged to capital 52 52 Current tax charge for the year 996 996 1,060 52 1,008 1 Following changes introduced by the 2009 Finance Act, overseas dividends are no longer chargeable to corporation tax.
Therefore, the Company no longer needs to use double taxation relief to eliminate a potential corporation tax liability.
b Factors affecting current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2009: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28% 2009: 28%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2010 2009 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 5,513 51,834 57,347 5,600 27,891 33,491 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the applicable rate of corporation tax of 28% 2009: 28% 1,544 14,514 16,058 1,568 7,809 9,377 Effects of: Non taxable overseas dividends 1,943 1,943 1,049 1,049 Non taxable capital returns 15,709 15,709 8,920 8,920 Non taxable scrip dividends 5 5 Income taxed in different periods 168 168 Tax relief on capitalised expenses 1,195 1,195 1,111 1,111 Overseas withholding tax 996 996 1,008 1,008 Unrelieved expenses and charges 1,599 1,599 944 944 Relief for overseas taxation 520 520 Tax attributable to expenses and finance costs charged to capital 52 52 Current tax charge for the year 996 996 1,060 52 1,008 42 JPMorgan American Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 American pp38 57 American pp38 57 09 03 2011 15:55 Page 43 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 8,455,000 2009: 7,206,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 27%.
The Finance Act 2010, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% effective from 1st April 2011, was substantively enacted on 21st July 2010.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main rate of corporation tax of 1% each year down to 24% by 1st April 2014.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Company has purchased sterling against the $ for settlement on 5th October 2011, matching the principal amount but not the maturity date of its 50 million debenture.
The counterparty to this transaction is The Royal Bank of Scotland.
The Company only hedges its currency risk in respect of the geared portion of the portfolio.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk continued i Currency risk continued Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st December are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments, which are not monetary items, are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2010 2009 $ $ 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are monetary items 29,831 8,745 Debtors securities sold awaiting settlement, overseas tax recoverable, dividends and interest receivable 1,556 421 Cash and short term deposits 30 501 Creditors securities purchased awaiting settlement 35 Forward currency contract 46,686 45,372 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 15,304 35,705 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 389,743 357,900 Total net foreign currency exposure 374,439 322,195 The above year end amounts are broadly representative of the exposure to currency risk during the current and comparative year.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2009: 10% appreciation or depreciation of sterling against the $ which is deemed to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened by 10% 2009: 10% against the $ this would have had the following effect: 2010 2009 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 702 707 Capital return 1,530 3,571 Total return after taxation for the year 828 2,864 Net assets 828 2,864 52 JPMorgan American Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 American pp38 57 American pp38 57 09 03 2011 15:55 Page 53 If sterling had strengthened by 10% 2009: 10% against the $ this would have had the following effect: 2010 2009 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 702 707 Capital return 1,530 3,571 Total return after taxation for the year 828 2,864 Net assets 828 2,864 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses with respect to monetary financial assets and liabilities are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative year.
The sensitivity with regard to the Companys investments and foreign currency is subsumed into other price risk sensitivity on page 55. ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposit and the liquidity fund.
The Companys exposure to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash and short term deposits 30 501 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 29,831 8,745 Total exposure 29,861 9,246 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR and interest payable on overdrafts is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2009: same.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day $ London Interbank Bid Rate 2009: same.
The 50 million debenture, which the Company has in issue, carries a fixed interest rate of 6.875% until the repayment date in June 2018.
The above year end exposures are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the cash balances and investments in the liquidity fund have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum exposures during the year, arising from cash balances and the liquidity fund were as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure to floating rates 31,667 29,729 Minimum interest rate exposure to floating rates 3,485 8,098 JPMorgan American Investment Trust plc.

This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
2010 2009 1% Increase 1% Decrease 1% Increase 1% Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 299 299 92 92 Capital return Total return after taxation for the year and net assets 299 299 92 92 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the Companys future exposure to interest rate changes, due to fluctuations in the level of cash balances and investment in the liquidity fund.
iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to other changes in market prices at 31st December comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 389,743 357,900 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk A list of the Companys investments is given on pages 16 to 18.
This shows that all of the investments value is in the USA.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However, it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2010 2009 More than More than three three Three months but Three months but months less than More than months less than More than or less one year one year Total or less one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 3,438 72,126 75,564 3,438 75,564 79,002 Securities purchased awaiting settlement 35 35 Other creditors and accruals 326 326 343 343 Performance fee payable 383 383 311 311 Performance fee provision 419 419 744 3,438 72,126 76,308 654 3,438 75,983 80,075 The liabilities shown above against debenture stock are the undiscounted contractual amounts that are to be paid and, as such differ from the amounts shown in the balance sheet.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager regularly monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 2009: A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase The Companys assets are ring-fenced in client designated accounts.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given on the protection of all the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The following amounts shown in the Balance Sheet, represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year end.

Capital management policies and procedures Composition of the Companys capital The Companys capital comprises the following: 2010 2009 000 000 Debt: 50,000,000 6.875% debenture June 2018 50,000 50,000 Equity: Equity share capital 10,713 10,682 Reserves 363,307 310,784 374,020 321,466 Total debt and equity 424,020 371,466 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and seek to maximise income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 95% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments, excluding liquidity fund holdings, expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
2010 2009 000 000 Investments excluding liquidity fund holdings 389,743 357,900 Net assets 374,020 321,466 Gearing 104.2% 111.3% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This includes a review of: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
