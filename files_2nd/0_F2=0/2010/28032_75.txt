A deferred tax asset of 24,722,000 2009: 23,302,000 has not been recognised in respect of these expenses since they are recoverable only to the extent that the Company has sufficient future taxable revenue.
Return per Ordinary Share Basic revenue, capital and total returns per ordinary share are based on each of the net returns on ordinary activities after taxation and on 209,593,601 2009: 207,591,806 ordinary shares being the weighted average number of shares in issue.
The subscription shares are dilutive when they would result in the issue of ordinary shares for less than the average market price of the ordinary shares during the year.
As the average market price of 200.38p 2009: 204.03p was less than the exercise price of 218.94p, there is no dilution of earnings.
