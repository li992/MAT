Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 19.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to oil and gas interests in the UK, West Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam and Pakistan which are expected to be incurred up to 2030.
These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
New provisions and changes in estimates result from an increase in decommissioning estimates for UK-operated fields following a detailed study undertaken during the year, increased operator estimates for non-operated UK fields, and new provisions for fields in development in Indonesia and Vietnam.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments derivatives, comprise accounts payable, bank loans and convertible bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-term cash flow and raise finance for the groups capital expenditure programme.
The group has various financial assets such as accounts receivable and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
The main risks that could adversely affect the groups financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain of these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 82 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 17.
Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and foreign currency.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options, reverse collars, swaps and hedges embedded in long-term crude offtake agreements.
Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options.
Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
The groups exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest rate borrowings within its debt portfolio.
However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical rates, substantially all of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets.
As the group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the groups transactions are denominated, significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain receipts and expenditures in sterling and Norwegian krone.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange - ` contracts.
From 2011 the group may also be materially exposed to exchange gains and losses in the Vietnamese do ng.
Fair value hierarchy In line with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2010, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value excluding any primary financial instruments such as cash and bank loans : Assets measured at fair value Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: At 31 December Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ million $ million $ million $ million 2010: Oil reverse collars 65.7 65.7 Total 65.7 65.7 2009: Oil reverse collars 80.9 80.9 Total 80.9 80.9 Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 83 17.
Financial instruments continued Liabilities measured at fair value Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss: At 31 December Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ million $ million $ million $ million 2010: Oil collars 69.9 69.9 Oil forward sale contracts 4.2 4.2 Gas collars 21.5 21.5 Interest rate swaps 12.9 12.9 Forward foreign exchange contracts 0.6 0.6 Total 109.1 109.1 2009: Oil collars 82.5 82.5 Oil forward sale contracts 24.8 24.8 Gas collars 29.8 29.8 Interest rate swaps 0.8 0.8 Forward foreign exchange contracts 0.2 0.2 Total 138.1 138.1 All of the above fair values are based on Level 2 techniques.
Commodity price risk Oil At 31 December 2010, the group had 5.04 million barrels of Dated Brent oil hedged with collars at an average floor price of US$47.0 bbl and an average cap of US$87.0 bbl, all of which were embedded through offtake agreements to the end of 2012.
The group also has oil collars with banks which are marked to market through profit or loss.
Additionally, the group has executed reverse collars with certain oil trading companies at strike prices identical to the bank collars.
Similar to the bank collars, these reverse collars are derivatives that must be marked to market through profit or loss.
They effectively offset each other, resulting in no net impact on the income statement or balance sheet.
The hedges embedded in long-term crude offtake agreements are not fair valued as they qualify for own-use exemption under IAS 39.
During the year, oil hedges for 4.64 million barrels matured generating a net cost of US$8.0 million 2009: US$15.0 million.
In the prior year, an unrealised fair value loss of US$9.8 million was calculated on the swaps which was recognised directly in retained earnings as the swaps were 100 per cent effective under hedge accounting rules.
This US$9.8 million fair value loss reversed from retained earnings in the year ended 31 December 2010 due to the maturity of the swaps.
Indonesian gas No changes have been made to the groups hedging position in Singapore 180 HSFO, which underlies the pricing mechanism for Indonesian gas sold into the Singapore market.
As at 31 December 2010, 282,000 metric tonnes mt of future production from the existing contract is hedged to the period ending mid-year 2013, with a floor of US$250.0 mt and a cap of US$500.0 mt.
During the year, Singapore 180 HSFO contracts for 120,000 metric tonnes matured generating a cash cost of US$0.1 million 2009: US$nil.
All of these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective.
In the current year US$20.4 million of the movement in the fair value of these contracts was credited to the income statement 2009: charge of US$26.9 million, as this movement related to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39.
The remaining movement, being a charge of US$12.0 million 2009: US$nil, related to the intrinsic value of such instruments and was recognised directly in retained earnings.

Commodity contract sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedge instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a ten per cent increase and a ten per cent decrease in this variable: Oil Gas Total Increase decrease in mark to market value $ million $ million $ million Ten per cent increase 43.7 11.7 55.4 Ten per cent decrease 31.3 9.7 41.0 Deferred revenue related to oil reverse collars Deferred revenue has been created due to first-day gains arising from offtake agreements and related oil reverse collars.
This deferred revenue is being released to the income statement over the life of each individual offtake agreement as shown below: Oil Gas Total Asset liability $ million $ million $ million At 1 January 2009 33.6 33.6 Recognised in the balance sheet 29.0 29.0 Credit to income statement for the year 8.5 8.5 At 31 December 2009 54.1 54.1 Credit to income statement for the year 18.2 18.2 At 31 December 2010 35.9 35.9 Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 85 17.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk At 31 December 2010, US$450.0 million of the groups long-term bank borrowings have been swapped from floating rate to fixed rate.
Under these interest rate swap contracts, the group has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at this date.
The movement in fair values is shown in the table below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2009 Charge to retained earnings for the year 0.8 At 31 December 2009 0.8 Cash settlement for swaps 7.0 Charge to income statement for the year 7.0 Charge to retained earnings for the year 12.1 At 31 December 2010 12.9 Interest rate swaps sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedge instruments is market expectations about future interest rates.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of comprehensive income to an increase of fifty basis points in this variable: Total Increase decrease in mark to market value $ million Increase of fifty basis points 7.6 A decrease of fifty basis points in this variable has not been considered appropriate due to the current very low level of floating interest rates.
Foreign currency exchange risk To cover sterling exposures an amount of 198.0 million was purchased with forward contracts during the year 2009: 123.8 million.
Premiers activities are largely conducted in US dollars.
All borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the currency of the assets.
The impact of variations in foreign exchange rates on the groups results would be immaterial.
Other financial instruments Credit risk The groups credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits.
The amount of receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables which were immaterial in 2010 and 2009.
The group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
An indication of the concentration of credit risk is shown in note 1, whereby the revenue from four customers each exceeded 10 per cent of the groups consolidated revenue in 2010 and 2009.
