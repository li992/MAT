Notes 1 Basis of Preparation and Business Environment The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of derivative instruments.
The functional and presentational currency of Pace plc is UK Sterling and the accounts are presented in millions.
The 2009 accounts were presented in thousands and therefore certain immaterial differences between these accounts and the comparatives shown herein may have arisen due to roundings.
International Financial Reporting Standards The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the Company.
Financial Year End The current years financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the previous years financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Basis of Consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings note 12 drawn up to 31 December 2010.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the period are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on the Group consolidation.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the financial statements of the Company.
Significant Judgements, Key Assumptions and Estimation Uncertainty The Groups main accounting policies affecting its results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 40 to 46.
Judgements and assumptions have been required by management in applying the Groups accounting policies in many areas.
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions.
Key areas of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements are as follows: Warranties Pace provides warranties for its products.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of a product before field deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the field.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Royalties Paces products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence.
Inadvertent actions may expose Pace to the risk of infringing third party intellectual property rights.
Potential claims can still be submitted many years after a product has been deployed.
Any such claims are always vigorously defended.
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Groups use including past usage of that technology.
Having taken legal advice, the board considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought.
The Group will vigorously negotiate or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the potential liabilities are finally settled.
The provision is based on the latest information available.
Operating Segments Following the introduction of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, the Group has determined that, based on its internal reporting framework and management structure, it has two reportable segments.
Such determination is necessarily judgemental in its nature and has been determined by management in preparing the financial statements.
The level of disclosure of segmental and other information is determined by such assessment.
Further detail is provided in notes 3 and 29.
Pace plc Annual Report | 40 2010 R&A spec back V19 10MAR11.
indd 42 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued Intangible Assets The Group business includes a significant element of research and development activity.
Under accounting standards, principally IAS38 Intangible Assets, there is a requirement to capitalise and amortise development spend to match costs to expected benefits from projects deemed to be commercially viable.
The application of this policy involves the ongoing consideration by management of the forecasted economic benefit from such projects compared to the level of capitalised costs, together with the selection of amortisation periods appropriate to the life of the associated revenues from the product.
Acquisition Accounting As part of the accounting for business combinations it is necessary to perform a purchase price allocation exercise to identify appropriate categories of intangible assets that have been purchased.
Such exercise involves judgement with regard to the types of assets identified, the value of those assets and the useful economic lives applied with regard to amortisation rates.
The amounts recognised are calculated by reference to management forecasts and assumed discount rates, obsolescence curves and attrition rates.
For significant acquisitions, whilst the Directors use appropriately qualified independent valuation advisors to assist in the purchase price allocation work, the exercise inherently requires significant judgement and estimation to be taken.
Contingent Liabilities In the previous year the Group disclosed contingent liabilities with regard to EU Import duty classification and a Writ issued against the Company.
Following developments during the year, namely a successful appeal against the retrospective assessment of import duty, together with advanced negotiations with the issuer of the Writ, the Directors have removed the contingent liabilities disclosures from the 2010 financial statements.
Going Concern The Group has borrowing facilities, to a maximum of $450m, in place until March 2014.
These are in the form of a $300m term loan, repayable via 6 instalments of $37.5m each, due every six months plus a final payment of $75m, and a $150m revolver credit facility.
These facilities are subject to financial performance covenants which the Group currently complies with.
The Boards assessment of the Group and Companys ability to continue as a going concern has taken into account the effect of the current economic climate, current market position and the new borrowings in the year.
The principal risks that the Group is challenged with have been set out in the Risks and Uncertainties section of this report along with how the Directors intend to mitigate those risks.
The Board has prepared a financial and working capital forecast based upon trading assumptions and other medium term plans and has concluded that the Group will continue to meet its financial performance covenants and will have adequate working capital available to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
2 Accounting Policies Business Combinations Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another.
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Group.
Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced mandatorily in the business combination.
If a business combination results in the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other expenses.
A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The Group measures any non-controlling interest at its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finders fees, legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees are expensed as incurred.
41 | Pace plc Annual Report 2010 R&A spec back V19 10MAR11.
indd 43 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued Goodwill Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Initial measurement The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Subsequent measurement Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
As permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 May 2004 date of transition to Adopted IFRS has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually.
The Group performs its annual impairment review at the cash-generating unit level.
Other Intangibles Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of other intangibles is done on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the particular asset categories as follows: Customer contracts and relationships 3-10 years Technology and patents 1-10 years Other 3 years Research and Development Expenditure All on-going research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Where a product is technically feasible, production and sales are intended, a market exists, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product concerned from commercial launch.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Where these conditions are not met development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between 6 and 18 months.
Capitalised development expenditure is not treated as a realised loss for the purpose of determining the Companys distributable profits as the costs meet the conditions required to be treated as an asset in accordance with IAS 38.
The amortisation of capitalised development expenditure is charged to the Income Statement in research and development expenditure within the Administrative expenses category.
Impairment Charges The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the esimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
For the purpose of impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Groups corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU.
Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonaable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Any impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
Pace plc Annual Report | 42 2010 R&A spec back V19 10MAR11.
indd 44 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Exceptional Items Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature and which are considered non-recurring are classified as exceptional operating items.
Such items, which include for instance the costs of opening or closing premises, costs of significant restructurings and profits and losses made on the disposal of properties are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement category but are highlighted separately in the notes to the financial statements.
Exceptional operating items are excluded from the profit measures used by the Board to monitor underlying performance.
Revenue Recognition Revenue comprises the value of sales of goods and services to third party customers occurring in the period, stated exclusive of value added tax and net of trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards in the product have passed to the customer, and substantially all of the Groups work is completed which is usually upon delivery to the customer, or his agent.
Revenue in respect of services rendered, including engineering consultancy and support and software services, is recognised over the period over which they are performed, in relation to the level of work undertaken, project milestones achieved and any future obligations remaining.
When a single sales transaction requires the delivery of more than one product or service multiple components, the revenue recognition criteria are applied to the separately identifiable components.
A component is considered to be separately identifiable if the product or service delivered has standalone value to that customer and the fair value associated with the product or service can be measured reliably.
The amount recognised as revenue for each component is the fair value of the element in relation to the fair value of the arrangement as a whole.
This requires a degree of management judgement, and the fair value allocations are, by their nature, best estimates.
The timing and amount of revenue recognition can vary depending on what assessments have been made.
Where there is no separate selling price of an element management determine fair value based on equivalent available products.
The Group does not recognise revenue before delivery has occurred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
The determination of whether the amount of revenue can be measured reliably or whether the fees are collectible is inherently judgemental.
Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and impairment losses recognised on financial assets.
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Government Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income statement or against the capitalised development expenditure as appropriate to match to the projects related expenditure.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Allowance for Doubtful Debts Trade receivables are assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually significant.
Where necessary, provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes appropriate transport and handling costs but excludes royalties due only on ultimate sale.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
43 | Pace plc Annual Report 2010 R&A spec back V19 10MAR11.
indd 45 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued Property, Plant and Equipment The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset concerned, the cost of property, plant and equipment, less any estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Long Leasehold properties Period of lease Plant and machinery One to ten years Short Leasehold properties Period of lease Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Leased Assets Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign Currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve is reclassified to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially measured at cost, which is equal to fair value at inception, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Following enhancements in the Groups hedging policy and changes in the Groups currency profiles following the acquisition of Pace France in 2008, the directors have determined that the instruments qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash-flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the movement in fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement within finance income costs.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into the income statement when the transaction occurs.
The Group has not designated the US loan as a hedge against the differences between the functional currency of the foreign operation and the parent companys functional currency.
Pace plc Annual Report | 44 2010 R&A spec back V19 10MAR11.
indd 46 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued Taxes Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing where relevant for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Share-based Payments The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as personnel expenses in profit or loss.
Employee Share Ownership Plans The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the Pace plc Employee Benefits Trust are treated as being those of the Company.
Until such time as the Companys own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the consideration paid for the shares is deducted in arriving at equity Employee Benefits Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Group has no defined benefit arrangements in place.
Equity Instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends Payable Distributions to equity holders are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
A liability is recorded for a final dividend when the dividend is declared by the Companys shareholders, and, for an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
a Royalties A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Groups use including past usage of that technology.
b Warranties A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
c Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
d Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
e Contingent consideration A provision is recognised for deferred contingent consideration relating to acquisitions, based on the expected fair value of the outflow.

indd 47 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued New accounting policies a Adopted by the Group The following accounting standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group: IFRS 3 Revised Business combinations.
The Group has adopted IFRS 3 Revised for acquisitions completed after 1 January 2010.
The revised standard has resulted in a number of changes, notably that directly attributable acquisition costs are to be expensed rather than included as part of the purchase price, contingent consideration is to be accounted for at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement.
In addition, where a group gains control of a subsidiary undertaking through a step acquisition, the standard requires the existing interest owed to be remeasured at fair value with the difference between fair value and book value being recognised in the income statement.
During the year ended 31 December 2010, Pace incurred directly attributable transaction costs of 5.9million which have been included in administrative expenses.
Where appropriate, comparatives in the consolidated financial statements have been restated in accordance with changes in accounting policies.
The following accounting standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or IFRIC, have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position: IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes IFRIC 15 Agreements for the construction of real estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation IFRIC 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to owners IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers Amendment to IAS 7 Classification of expenditures on unrecognised assets Amendment to IAS 17 Classification of leases of land and buildings Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing costs Amendment to IAS 24 Related Party Disclosure Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments Amendment to IAS 38 Intangible assets, fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement Eligible hedged items Amendment to IFRS 2 Share based payment: vesting conditions and cancellations Amendment to IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Amendment to IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives b Not adopted by the Group The following standards and amendments, issued by the IASB or IFRIC and endorsed by the EU, unless otherwise stated, have not yet been adopted by the Group.
The Group does not currently believe the adoption of these standards or interpretations would have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.

IFRS 9 Financial instruments Amendment to IAS 12 Recovery of underlying assets 3 Segmental Analysis The Groups principal activities are the development, design and distribution of digital television technologies for the global PayTV and telecommunications industries.
Following the acquisitions of Bewan Systems SA Bewan, 2Wire, Inc 2Wire and Latens Systems Ltd Latens in 2010, the Group has added to its activities the development, design and distribution of advanced residential gateways, associated software and services for the broadband service provider market and software services for the payTV market.
The Group also provides engineering design, software applications and support services to multiple sevices operators, broadcasters, telecommunications companies and retail markets worldwide.
The Group operates through a number of operating segments, being groupings of Customer Account Teams underpinned by the technology used for each customer.
Each Customer Account Team is involved in the design and distribution of, and services relating to set top boxes and residential gateways to major PayTV operators, telecommunications operators and retailers.
The exceptions to these in the year were: The Networks Customer Account Team, which was established in 2009 and is not material to the Group: The Bewan Customer Account Team which was established in 2010 following the acquisition of that business and is not material to the Group The 2Wire and Latens businesses which were not fully integrated into Customer Account Teams in 2010.
Pace plc Annual Report | 46 2010 R&A spec back V19 10MAR11.
indd 48 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued Consideration of IFRS 8 Operating Segments Following the introduction of IFRS 8, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, the Group has made the following considerations to arrive at the disclosure made in these financial statements.
IFRS 8 requires the segment information presented in the financial statements to be that which is used internally by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM to evaluate the performance of the business and decide how to allocate resources.
The Group has identified the Board of Directors as its chief operating decision maker.
The Board of Directors review internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information to evaluate the performance of the business and make decisions.
Operating segments have then been identified based on the internal reporting information, and management structures within the Group.
From such information Customer Account Teams are determined to represent operating segments.
Following the identification of operating segments, the Group has then assessed the similarity of the economic characteristics of the various operating segments.
Given the similarity of the products and services and markets operated in within each Customer Account Team of the existing business, ie before acquisitions, it has been concluded that these operating segments have fundamentally the same economic characteristics.
Given this, the Group has considered the overriding core principles of IFRS 8 and has determined that it is appropriate to aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment for the purposes of disclosure in the financial statements.
Acquisitions in the year were not fully integrated into Customer Account Teams in 2010.
The CODM received aggregated information to monitor them separately from the existing business.
Therefore it is considered appropriate to disclose them as a separate reportable segment in the current year.
As the new acquisitions are fully integrated into the Group in 2011, further consideration will be given to reportable segments.
Reconciliations of reportable segment revenues, profit or loss, assets and liabilities and other material items Information regarding the results of the reportable segment is included below.
Performance is measured based on segment profit before income tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors.
Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
There are no material Inter-segment transactions.
Revenues disclosed below materially represent revenues to external customers.
Where appropriate pricing is determined on an arms length basis.

Category of revenue In the current year the bulk of the Groups revenue is categorised as arising from the provision of set-top box hardware.

indd 55 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued Goodwill All goodwill has arisen from business combinations and relates to the know-how acquired with the purchase of XCom Multimedia Communications SA now Pace Europe SAS in February 2001 and the expected synergies, future revenue stream and know-how acquired with the purchase of Pace France in April 2008.
Further goodwill has arisen in the period relating to the three acquisitions referred to in note 29.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across Cash Generating Units CGUs and these CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections based on a combination of individual financial three year forecasts and appropriate long term growth rates of between 1 and 2% 2009: 1 and 2%.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are discounted back to present value using an appropriate market-based discount rate.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate the value in use range from 10% to 14% 2009: 12%.
The Directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and do not consider that any reasonable change in the assumptions would give rise to the need for any impairment.

On 31 August 2010 the Company cancelled its 35m revolving credit facility with RBS and replaced it with a $450m facility underwritten by RBS and HSBC incorporating Lloyds TSB, Barclays, Santander and Yorkshire Bank in a syndicated deal.
The main facilities, which are all denominated in US Dollars and unsecured, consist of a $300m term loan facility together with a $150m revolving credit facility.
The loans were drawn down in October 2010 to partially fund the acquisition of 2Wire, Inc. see note 29.
The facilities have a termination date of 31 March 2014.
Amortisation of the term loan commences on 20 June 2011 with repayments of $37.5m made every six months until 20 December 2013.
A final bullet repayment of $75m is due to be made on 31 March 2014.
Interest is payable on the facilities at LIBOR plus a specified margin.
The margin is subject to a ratchet linked to overall leverage conditions of the Group.
Facility arrangement and associated fees of $9m have been capitalised and are being amortised over the life of the facilities and included within the overall interest costs.
There are certain financial covenants with regard to the facilities.
These are principally linked to interest cover and net leverage.
In addition to the main facilities a Bi-lateral Bonding Facility with RBS was also entered into and covers bank guarantees, principally in respect of Duty and Deferment requirements 100,000.

The Group endeavours to obtain as much of its income as possible in US Dollars but a proportion of income is currently received in Sterling or Euros.
The Groups policy is to hedge forward progressively against movements in the value of foreign currencies, in respect of cash receipts and payments expected from transactions over the next 12 months.
The Group typically enters into between 4 and 6 forward currency contracts each month covering the next 12 months.

d Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors.
Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
There were no significant impairments in the periods under review.
Credit risk Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 61 | Pace plc Annual Report 2010 R&A spec back V19 10MAR11.

At each balance sheet date there was no significant concentration of credit risk, other than those customers with revenues in excess of 10% of the Groups total revenues, as explained in note 3 of the financial statements.
Of the trade receivables at 31 December 2010, 91% was within terms 2009: 95%.
The balance was less than 30 days past due 2009: 100%.
There were no material bad debts provisions deemed necessary against such balances, in the current or preceding years.
e Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

The directors have considered the periods in which the cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur, together with the timing of impact on profit or loss, and have determined that the timings are as disclosed in the above table.
f Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
The Directors consider that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates during a twelve month period would have a 1.8m impact on cash flows.
The Groups key foreign exchange exposures are in respect of the Euro and US Dollar.
A 1% strengthening in Sterling against these would have an adverse impact of 0.3m 2009: 0.7m on the profit reported in the year ended 31 December 2010 and an adverse impact of 3.3m 2009: 1.5m on equity.
g Capital management Capital risk management The Group and Company manage their capital to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group and Company comprises: equity attributable to equity holders of Pace plc, consisting of issued ordinary share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 20, 21 and 23 and cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in Note 17.
The Group and Company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issue of new shares and buy-back of existing shares and issuing new borrowings or repaying existing borrowings.
The Groups and Companys overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
Note 20 to the Financial Statements provides details regarding the Companys share capital and movements in the period.
There were no breaches of any requirements with regard to any relevant conditions imposed by either the UKLA or the Companys Articles of Association during the periods under review.
Details of the Companys working capital facilities are given in Note 17.
Such facilities are subject to certain financial performance covenants.
There have been no breaches of these covenants in the period under review.

Negotiations over these liabilities continue for long periods of time.
The directors have made provision for the potential royalties payable based on the latest information available.
Having taken legal advice, the Board considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought.
Given the nature of the claims it is not possible to be more specific with regard to the timing of outflows.
Pace plc Annual Report | 64 2010 R&A spec back V19 10MAR11.
indd 66 11 03 2011 16:18 Notes Continued The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the negotiation of royalty claims during the year would be seriously prejudicial to other royalty claims under negotiation, in litigation or dispute.
Accordingly the directors have aggregated amounts released unused with additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year shown above.
Other provisions Other provisions relate to retirement and restructuring provisions in relation to the Pace France business and deferred contingent consideration in relation to the Bewan and Latens acquisitions.
Warranties Pace provides warranties for its products from the point of sale and a provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data, principally historical failure rates and related cost of repair information, and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of product shipment before field deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the field.
It is expected that the expenditure with regard to warranties will be incurred within three years of the balance sheet date.
