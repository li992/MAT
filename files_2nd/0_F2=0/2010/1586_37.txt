Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 11.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
On 28 June 2010, the Finance Bill 2010-11 was presented to Parliament.
The Bill proposed four annual reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% by 2014-15.
At the balance sheet date, the reduction in the corporation tax rate to 27% from April 2011 had been enacted.
It is currently expected that each future Finance Bill enacted will reduce the corporation tax rate by 1% until the rate of 24% is reached.
Any excess amount of tax benefit in respect of stock options is recognised in equity.
