FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 32.
Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buy backs and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Funding and exposure management The group finances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits, deferred taxation and long-term and short-term borrowing.
The group borrows in the major long-term bond markets in major currencies and typically, but not exclusively, these markets provide the most cost effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates against these borrowings.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from funding its overseas operations, acquisitions, overseas assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investments and counterparty credit risk arising from transactions with financial institutions.
This treasury operation also manages the groups market risk exposures, including risks arising from volatility in currency and interest rates.
The treasury operation acts as a central bank to members of the group providing central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services.
Funding and deposit taking is usually provided in the functional currency of the relevant entity.
The treasury operation is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage financial risk at optimum cost.
Treasury policy The Board sets the policy for the groups treasury operation and its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings and investments and group wide exposures under its management.
The Board has delegated its authority to operate these polices to a series of panels that are responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director.
The key policies dened by the Board are highlighted in each of the sections below.
The financial risk management of exposures arising from trading related financial instruments, primarily trade receivables and trade payables, is through a series of policies and procedures set at a group and line of business level.
Line of business management apply these policies and procedures and perform review processes to assess and manage financial risk exposures arising from these financial instruments.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2010 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Capital management The objective of the groups capital management policy is to reduce net debt whilst investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and delivering progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, the group may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
The group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to the groups objectives and processes during 2010 and 2009.
The groups capital structure consists of net debt, committed facilities and shareholders equity excluding the cash ow reserve.
The following analysis summarises the components which the group manages as capital: 2010 2009 2008 At 31 March m m m Total parent shareholders deficit equity excluding cash ow reserve 2,797 421 5,252 Net debt 9,283 10,361 9,460 Committed facilities 1,500 2,300 2,335 Total capital 7,986 12,240 17,047 Interest rate risk management Management policy The group has interest bearing financial assets and financial liabilities which may expose the group to either cash ow or fair value volatility.
The groups policy, as prescribed by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of net debt is at xed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval from the Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the Board.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate mix prole, the group has entered into swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
Under cross currency swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, US Dollar and Euro xed rates into either xed or oating Sterling interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
Under Sterling interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the differences between xed rate and oating rate Sterling interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
The group uses a combination of these derivatives to primarily x its interest rates.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of hedging instruments.
Outstanding currency and interest rate swaps at 31 March 2010 are detailed in the Hedging activities and Other derivatives sections below.
At 31 March 2010 the groups xed oating interest rate prole, after hedging, on gross debt was 91:9 2009: 87:13.
Sensitivities The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that a 100 basis point increase 2009: 100 basis point increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies is a reasonable benchmark for performing a sensitivity analysis.
All adjustments to interest rates for the impacted financial instruments are assumed to take effect from the respective balance sheet date.
After the impact of hedging, the groups main exposure to interest rate volatility in the income statement arises from fair value movements on derivatives not in hedging relationships and on variable rate borrowings and investments which are largely inuenced by Sterling interest rates.
Trade payables, trade receivables and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to interest rate volatility.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of net debt at 31 March 2010, a 100 basis point increase 2009 and 2008: 100 basis point increase in Sterling interest rates would decrease the groups annual net finance expense by approximately 17m 2009: 5m, 2008: 5m.
The groups main exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders equity, as dened in IFRS 7, arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The derivatives have an underlying interest rate exposure to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar rates.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of derivatives included in the cash ow reserve at the balance sheet date, a 100 basis point increase 2009 and 2008: 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies would impact equity, before tax, as detailed below: 2010 2009 2008 m m m Charge Charge Charge At 31 March credit credit credit Sterling interest rates 496 550 470 US Dollar interest rates 392 538 347 Euro interest rates 134 149 90 The impact as a result of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
The long-term debt instruments which the group issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants providing that if the BT Group credit rating were downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next coupon period at a rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency.
In February 2010 S&P downgraded BTs credit rating to BBB.
Prior to this in March 2009, Moodys and S&P downgraded BTs credit rating to Baa2 and BBB, respectively.
Based on the total debt of 4.4bn outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2010, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 9m in the year ending 31 March 2011 if BTs credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded respectively by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa2 BBB.
In addition, the groups 600m 2014 bond issued in June 2009 would attract an additional 1.25 percentage points for a downgrade by one credit rating category by both Moodys and S&P below Baa3 BBB, respectively.
This would result in an additional finance expense of 5m in the year ending 31 March 2011.
Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the Board.
The policy delegates authority to the Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management to take positions of up to 100m and for the Group Finance Director to take positions of up to 1bn.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Exposure and hedging A significant proportion of the groups current revenue is invoiced in Sterling, and a significant element of its operations and costs arise within the UK.
The groups overseas operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
The groups foreign currency borrowings, which totalled 9.4bn at 31 March 2010 2009: 9.9bn, are used to finance its operations and have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross currency swaps.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacic region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading ows.
Sensitivities After hedging, with all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement from a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies would result in a credit charge respectively of approximately 26m 2009: approximately 20m.
The groups main exposure to foreign exchange volatility within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The majority of foreign exchange uctuations in the cash ow reserve are recycled immediately to the income statement to match the hedged item and therefore the groups exposure to foreign exchange uctuations in equity would be insignicant in both 2010 and 2009.
Outstanding cross currency swaps at 31 March 2010 are detailed in the Hedging activities and Other derivatives sections below.
Credit risk management Treasury management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading related receivables.
For treasury related balances, the Boards dened policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as dened by Moodys and Standard and Poors and by dening the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.
Management review significant utilisations on a regular basis to determine the adjustments required, if any, and actively manage any exposures which may arise.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk.
The group makes use of standard International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA documentation.
In addition, where possible the group will seek a combination of a legal right of set off and net settlement.
The group also seeks collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
The treasury operation regularly reviews the credit limits applied when investing with counterparties in response to market conditions and continues to monitor their credit quality and actively manage any exposures which arise.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 At 31 March m m m Derivative financial assets 1,700 2,700 387 Investments 470 218 471 a Trade and other receivables 2,947 3,101 3,193 Cash and cash equivalents 1,452 1,300 1,435 Total 6,569 7,319 5,486 a The carrying amount excludes 749m 2009: 1,084m, 2008: 1,256m of current and 336m 2009: 322m, 2008: 854m of non current trade and other receivables which relate to non financial assets.
Note 19 discloses the credit concentration and credit quality of derivative financial assets.
The majority of these derivatives are in designated cash ow hedges.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of net derivative financial assets at 31 March 2010, a 100 basis point shift in yield curves across each of the ratings categories within which these derivative financial assets are classied would change their carrying values and impact equity, before tax, as follows: Impact of 100 basis Impact of 100 basis point increase point decrease At 31 March 2010 m m Moodys S&P credit rating Aa2 AA 3 4 Aa3 AA 26 30 A1 A 89 104 A2 A 102 122 220 260 The credit quality of other treasury related financial assets is disclosed in notes 10 and 14.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Operational management policy The groups credit policy for trading related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
The group will also enhance credit protection when appropriate, taking into consideration the customers exposure to the group, by applying processes which include netting and off setting, and requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading related financial assets.
The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 17 which analyses outstanding balances by line of business and reects the nature of customers in each line of business.
Liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the Board.
The groups liquidity and funding management process includes projecting cash ows and considering the level of liquid assets in relation thereto, monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources and back up facilities.
The Board reviews forecasts, including cash ow forecasts, on a quarterly basis.
The treasury operation reviews cash ows more frequently to assess the short and medium-term requirements.
These assessments ensure the group responds to possible future cash constraints in a timely manner.
Liquid assets surplus to the immediate operating requirements of the group are generally invested and managed by the treasury operation.
Requests from group companies for operating finance are met whenever possible from central resources.
Liquidity position 2010 2009 2008 At 31 March m m m Net debt 9,283 10,361 9,460 During 2010, the groups net debt decreased from 10.4bn to 9.3bn primarily driven by higher free cash ow partially offset by the pension deficit payment of 525m in December 2010.
During 2010, debt amounting to 1bn matured consisting of 0.7bn of commercial paper and 0.3bn of long-term debt.
This was offset by new issuance of a 600m bond at 6.125% repayable in 2014 which was swapped into 520m at a xed semi-annual rate of 6.8%.
During 2009, the groups net debt increased from 9.5bn to 10.4bn primarily driven by lower free cash ow being exceeded by dividend and share buy back payments.
During 2009, debt amounting to 0.9bn matured consisting of bank notes and Sterling oating notes.
This was offset by new issuances of 1.5bn mainly consisting of a 1bn bond at 6.5% repayable in 2015, which was swapped into 0.8bn at an average annualised Sterling interest rate of 7.7%, and commercial paper.
In addition, investments of 0.3bn matured.
During 2010 and 2009 the group issued commercial paper and held cash, cash equivalents and current asset investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2010 the group had an undrawn committed borrowing facility of 1.5bn 2009: 1.5bn.
The facility is available for the period to January 2013.
The group had an additional undrawn committed borrowing facility of 900m which expired in March 2010.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage renancing needs as they arise.
The group has two significant term debt maturities during the 2011 financial year.
In December 2010 the groups US Dollar 8.625% note matures with a principal of $2,883m 1,742m at swapped rates and in February 2011 a Euro 7.375% note matures with a principal of 1,125m 758m at swapped rates.
The group has built up significant liquidity in anticipation of these maturities which, alongside cash ows generated from operations and the groups nancing strategy, will fund this requirement.
In May 2010, the group entered into a 650m two-year facility arrangement.
There are no term debt maturities in the 2012 financial year.
At 31 March 2010, the groups credit rating was BBB with stable outlook with S&P and Baa2 with negative outlook with Moodys respectively 2009: BBB with stable outlook Baa2 with negative outlook.

Other derivatives At 31 March 2010, the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts which were not in hedging relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales and had a notional principal amount of 189m for purchases of currency 2009: 533m and had a maturity period of under one month 2009: under nine months.
Interest rate swaps not in hedging relationships under IAS 39 had a notional principal amount of 1.9bn 2009: 1.9bn and mature between 2014 and 2030 2009: 2014 and 2030.
The interest receivable under these swap contracts is at a weighted average rate of 4.2% 2009: 6% and interest payable is at a weighted average rate of 5.8% 2009: 7.6%.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their fair value movements.
In 2009 the group entered into credit default swap contracts to economically hedge part of its US Dollar denominated derivative financial assets, which had a notional principal of $90m.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Fair value of financial instruments The table below discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments which are not carried at an amount which approximates to their fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2010, 2009 and 2008.
The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The fair values of listed investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
The carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the investments held.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the amounts receivable and payable.
The fair value of the groups bonds, debentures, notes, finance leases and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
The fair value of the groups outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts were the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ow models taking into account market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.
