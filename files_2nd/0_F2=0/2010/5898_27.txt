In the UK, the Finance No 2 Act 2010, which was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, included legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
This change has been reflected in these financial statements, resulting in a 0.4m charge to equity.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
The overall effect of the further changes from 27% to 24%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 August 2010, would be to reduce deferred tax assets by 1.3m.
