LTIP awards granted to Malcolm Harris whilst an executive director continue in force until the third anniversary of the award date and, should either of the two measures of performance be met, the number of shares which can be realised will be reduced according to the proportion of the three year performance period following cessation of employment, measured in complete months, relative to the three year performance period.
Share ownership guidelines There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes shares.
The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all costs and income tax due, as shares.
This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal to current basic annual salary.
