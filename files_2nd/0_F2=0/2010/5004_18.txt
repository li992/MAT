The standards and interpretation to be adopted by the Group include: Effective date financial years ending International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS IAS IFRS 2 Amendments to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment: cash-settled share-based payment transactions 30 April 2011 Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations: The revised standard still requires the purchase method of accounting to be applied 30 April 2011 to business combinations, however, this will introduce some changes to the existing accounting treatment.
For example, contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All transaction costs incurred in connection with a business combination do not form part of the business combination transaction and will be expensed.
The Group will apply the revised IFRS 3 prospectively to all business combinations from 1 May 2010.

SEGMENT REPORTING CONTINUED The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments during the year.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and allocation of resources by the Group Chief Executive.
The Directors have reviewed the business segments identified under the previous standard IAS 14 Segmental Reporting, and consider that these reported segments remain appropriate under IFRS 8.
Further details of these business segments are given in the Business Review on pages 1 to 39.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year-on-year.
Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment at a capital employed level.
Capital employed excludes items of a financing nature, taxation balances, post-retirement benefit liabilities and non-current asset investments: segmental capital employed comprises identifiable segment assets less segmental liabilities.
Average capital employed is the average monthly capital employed.
The adjusted return on average capital employed is defined as operating profit before exceptional items divided by average capital employed.
In presenting information by geographical area, external revenue is based on geographical location of customers.
Non-current assets exclude investments and derivative financial instruments and are based on the geographical location of the assets.

DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2010 77 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 10.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Impairment loss Due to the downturn in the non-food retail sector, resulting from the UK recession, the Multigraphics business, a UK business which provides printing services and display material for the retail sector, which was acquired in 2008, has not met the Groups expectations as at 30 April 2010.
The Group has implemented a new business plan which resulted in an impairment loss being recognised on the goodwill identified at the time of acquisition.
The recoverable amount of the Multigraphics cash-generating unit CGU was estimated based on its value in use.
Based on the assessment performed, the carrying amount of the CGU was determined to be 3.9m higher than its recoverable amount, resulting in an impairment loss being recognised.
The estimate of value in use was determined using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.8% 2008 09: 11.8%.
The impairment loss is recognised in exceptional items within the UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging segment.
An additional goodwill impairment loss of 0.4m has also been recognised due to the carrying amount of another CGU within the UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging segment exceeding its recoverable amount estimated based on its value in use.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following segments have CGUs containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill after the impairment losses recognised: 2010 2009 m m UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging 140.2 144.3 Plastic Packaging 40.8 39.1 181.0 183.4 Segments with no CGUs containing individually significant goodwill 16.1 15.9 Total goodwill 197.1 199.3 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculation were: cash forecasts derived from the latest budgets and forecasts for the two years ending 30 April 2012 as approved by the Directors.
Cash flows for the following three years were extrapolated assuming a progressive recovery in margins to historical levels: the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group is 11.8% 2008 09: 11.8%.
The Group believes that the risk profile across the significant markets in which it operates are not significantly different, hence the same WACC is universally applied across all CGUs: and long-term growth rates are either equal to or less than the inflation assumption.
The outcome of the impairment tests for the CGUs containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill after the impairment losses recognised is summarised as follows: 2010 2009 Headroom m m UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging 114.5 47.6 Plastic Packaging 68.9 55.3 The headroom represents the difference between the calculated value in use and the net asset carrying value of the CGU.
Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible further impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
For instance, factors which could cause impairment are: significant underperformance relative to the forecast results: changes to the way the assets are used or our strategy for the business: a further deterioration in the industry or the wider economy: and an increase in the Groups WACC.
The value in use is based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
The Directors believe the assumptions used are appropriate, but in addition have conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the changes in assumptions that would result in impairment.
A half percentage point increase in the WACC to 12.3% would result in a reduction in the headroom for the CGUs containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill within UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging, reducing to circa 86m.
The headroom for the CGUs containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill within Plastic Packaging would similarly reduce to circa 61m.
In order for there to be no further impairments within UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging, adjusted operating profits will need to achieve circa 69m in 2015 16: this compares to 36.5m in 2008 09 and 35.4m in 2009 10.
The assumptions underpinning UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging adjusted operating profits reflect managements expectations of a return to historic levels of margins and profitability by 2015 16.

In 2008 09, the Group fully impaired the carrying value of its investment in Rubezhansk and recognised an exceptional loss of 5.1m, being the Groups share of the after-tax net loss at Rubezhansk incurred in the second half of 2008 09.
This was as a result of foreign exchange losses on the US$87m loan, following the significant decline in the Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US dollar.
Exchange rate movements resulted in Rubezhansk breaching its banking covenants.
In 2009 10, negotiations continue with Rubezhanks bankers following the breaching of the banking covenants.
Whilst the uncertainty of the financial position continues at Rubezhansk, the Group has not recognised any profits in respect of its investment in the associate.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE The Copikas business, a corrugated packaging business in Turkey, within the Continental European Corrugated Packaging segment, is presented as a disposal group held for sale following the commitment of the Board, on 27 April 2010, to a plan to sell the business to focus on growing core businesses of scale within its portfolio.
The sale of Copikas for a cash consideration of 4.7m payable on completion, which was agreed on 28 May 2010 with Olmuksa International Paper-Sabanci Ambalaj Sanayi five Ticaret A. S. is subject to the Turkish Competition Boards approval that is anticipated will take around six weeks.
At 30 April 2010, the disposal group comprised assets of 7.4m, less liabilities of 5.7m.
An exceptional impairment loss of 5.9m on the remeasurement of the disposal group to the lower of its carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell has been recognised in exceptional items, of which 4.7m has been allocated against property, plant and equipment and the remainder against inventories see note 4.
Additionally, assets of 0.7m less liabilities of 0.4m of a small packaging business within the UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging business have been presented as assets and liabilities held for sale following the commitment of the Board, on 27 April 2010, to dispose of the business.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups activities expose the Group to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
A summary of the Groups key financial risks and the policies and objectives in place to manage these risks is set out in the Financial Review and Risk Management sections of the Business Review on pages 28 to 33.
The derivative financial instruments set out in this note have been entered into to help achieve the Groups risk management objectives.
The Groups treasury policy is not to engage in speculative transactions.
a Carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is the accounting classification of the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.

For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists.
The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note purchase agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the statement of financial position.
Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedge accounting rules, only portions of the note purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the statement of financial position.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities which bear floating rates of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires the classification of fair value measurements using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the assessments: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the Groups financial instruments are Level 2 financial instruments.
The Group does not hold any Level 1 or Level 3 financial instruments.
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2010 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED b Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and commodity risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the financing of these activities.
All derivatives have been designated as effective hedging instruments and are carried at their fair value.
The assets and liabilities of the Group as at 30 April in respect of derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Liabilities Net 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m m m Derivatives held to Manage the interest rate and currency exposures on borrowings and net investments 11.3 11.0 21.5 19.3 10.2 8.3 Derivative financial instruments included in net debt 11.3 11.0 21.5 19.3 10.2 8.3 Derivatives held to Hedge future transactions energy costs 5.3 11.2 13.1 4.5 7.8 6.7 Hedge future transactions foreign exchange on purchases and sales of goods and services 1.6 3.2 0.1 0.6 1.5 2.6 Total derivative financial instruments 18.2 25.4 34.7 24.4 16.5 1.0 Current 6.3 11.7 8.7 0.7 2.4 11.0 Non-current 11.9 13.7 26.0 23.7 14.1 10.0 18.2 25.4 34.7 24.4 16.5 1.0 c Cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges i Cash flow hedging reserve movements The following table identifies the movements in the cash flow hedging reserve during the year.

The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical for all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the hedging is highly effective.
The pre-tax loss on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in the year was 6.2m 2008 09: gain of 48.4m offset by a pre-tax gain on the fair value of the debt of 6.1m 2008 09: loss of 47.2m.
iii Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group holds currency swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax gain on the hedges recognised in equity in the year was 5.7m 2008 09: loss of 19.4m.
The gain or loss is matched by a similar gain or loss in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign subsidiarys net assets.
During the year, hedge ineffectiveness arising from hedges of net investments resulted in a gain of 0.7m 2008 09: loss of 0.6m.
d Risk identification and risk management i Capital risk The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash: operating cash flow, borrowings, shareholders equity and disposals of peripheral businesses, where appropriate.
The Groups objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing flexibility in immediate and medium-term funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions.
The Group also aims to maintain a strong statement of financial position and to provide continuity of financing by having a range of maturities and borrowings from a variety of sources.
The Groups overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds are available for the Group to carry out its strategy and to manage financial risks.
The Groups treasury strategy is controlled though the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly and includes the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and the Group Treasurer.
The Group Treasury Function operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and controlled by the Group Treasurer.
The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements strategies for interest rate, foreign exchange rate and energy exposure management.
ii Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate because of a change in market prices.
The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with expectations of changes in interest rates, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the statement of financial position or protecting interest rate expense through interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
At 30 April 2010, 44% 2009: 35% of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings were fixed for a period of at least one year.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on profit and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates representing managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates in all currencies in which the Group had variable rate borrowings at 30 April.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits have been increased by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 100 basis points increase in interest rates on the market values of the Groups interest rate derivatives.

At 30 April 2010, losses of 3.5m 2009: losses of 3.5m net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur over time to 2016.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk on investments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Groups presentational currency.
The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps.
Gains and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in reserves.
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges this exposure through crosscurrency swaps designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
Foreign exchange risk on transactions Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales and material purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
At 30 April 2010, gains of 1.8m 2009: gains of 1.4m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which occurs within two years.
During the year, 1.4m of gains deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement 2008 09: losses of 0.6m.
The Groups main currency exposures are from the euro and US dollar.
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Groups results of a 10% change in the year-end exchange rate of sterling against all other currencies.
10% represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The analysis is only on financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges.
Loans that are treated as net investment hedges are not recorded within the impact on the Groups profit as the impact of foreign exchange movements on these are offset by equal and opposite movements in the foreign assets that the instruments hedge.
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments.
At 30 April 2010, losses of 5.7m 2009: gains of 4.8m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
During the year, gains of 6.0m deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement 2008 09: gains of 5.1m.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is managements assessment of the reasonably possible approximation of how much markets can move, on average, over any given year.
In some years prices will be less volatile and in others they may be more volatile.
A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity.

In the current economic environment, the Group has placed increased emphasis on the management of credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets at 30 April 2010 was 455.6m 2009: 446.6m and is analysed in note 21 a.
This represents the maximum credit exposure.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED d Risk identification and risk management continued iv Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, will have difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate financial resources, by continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities to these risks.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.
Following a change in UK tax legislation during the period which resulted in dividends from overseas subsidiaries not being subject to corporation tax, the Group no longer has unrecognised deferred tax liabilities 2009: 5.2m in respect of temporary differences associated with the unremitted earnings of the subsidiaries.
Prior to this change in legislation no liabilities had been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group was in a position to control the timing of their reversal.

Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived.
Non-controlling interests At the beginning of the year, the Group had a liability of 3.5m and a corresponding entry against non-controlling interests in respect of the noncontrolling shareholders put option in Toscana Ondulati SpA.
This amount was calculated with reference to the recent profitability of the company using a multiple based formula.
The fair value of the put options increased during the year by 0.4m 2009: 0.9m.
This charge was recorded within finance costs through the income statement and then transferred out of retained earnings into non-controlling interests.

POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS Liability for defined benefit obligations The Group operates a funded, defined benefit scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension scheme the Group scheme.
The Group made agreed annual contributions of 15.6m to the Group scheme in 2009 10 2008 09: 15.6m.
The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives: these are, in aggregate, not significant to the Group.
The following financial information includes amounts related to these other arrangements, where appropriate.
A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Group scheme was as at 30 April 2007, which will be updated to 30 April 2010 by a qualified independent actuary.
All UK valuations used the projected unit method.
The Group scheme is closed to new entrants.
Because of this, the average age of the active members is likely to increase at future valuations and this may lead to an increasing current service contribution rate: this may be offset by a falling total pensionable salary resulting from leavers and retirements.
Liability for defined benefit obligations Principal actuarial assumptions are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 % % % % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.6% 6.4% 5.9% 5.4% 5.1% Inflation 3.5% 3.3% 3.5% 2.9% 2.7% Future salary increases 4.5% 4.3% 4.5% 3.9% 3.7% Future pension increases for pre 30 April 2005 service 3.5% 3.3% 3.5% 2.9% 2.7% Future pension increases for post 30 April 2005 service 2.4% 2.3% 2.3% 2.3% 2.3% Expected return on plan assets 6.5% 6.7% 6.7% 6.6% 6.6% The sensitivity of the liabilities and annual service costs in the main UK scheme to the key assumptions above is summarised below: Increase in Increase in pension liability service costs m m 0.5% decrease in discount rate 80.0 1.6 0.5% increase in inflation 70.0 1.0 1 year increase in life expectancy 20.0 0.2 Future mortality is the most significant demographic assumption.
The basic mortality table used by the Group at 30 April 2010 is PMA92 PFA92 30 April 2009: PMA92 PFA92 with medium cohort mortality improvement.
This means the mortality rates assumed for members of a particular age differ from those for members who will reach that age in the future.
Studies have illustrated that the amount of pension, the location of employees and the nature of their work are significant factors affecting mortality.
As a result, the basic mortality table rates are based on ages two years older than the members actual age for non-pensioners and three years older for pensioners.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE The Groups share-based payment arrangements are as follows: i An Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2008.
In normal circumstances, the vesting of any options granted under the ESOS is subject to remaining in service and that the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share equals or exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant.
ii A Restricted Share Plan RSP.
This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2004.
Under the RSP, participants received an award of shares in the Company equal in value to the participants annual cash bonus.
In normal circumstances the shares vested on the third anniversary of award subject to remaining in service.
iii A Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
In normal circumstances LTIP awards vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to satisfaction of performance conditions and remaining in service.
Performance is measured over a single period of three financial years commencing with the year in which the award is made and is based on the Companys total shareholder return performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
Full vesting occurs for a ranking of upper quartile or higher reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance.
None of the award vests for below median performance.
No awards will vest, irrespective of total shareholder return performance, unless the Companys earnings per share growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.

Shares awarded to Directors under the Plan will vest automatically if the Director is still employed by the Company three years after the grant of the award.
v A Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan RDSP was introduced during 2007 08 for Mr S W Dryden.
The shares awarded under the Plan replace similar deferred share awards granted to Mr Dryden by his previous employer.
vi A Performance Share Plan PSP.
Awards under the PSP normally vest after three years subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant.
Awards have been made under the PSP in 2008 and 2009.
The performance conditions are as detailed below see the Remuneration Report on pages 47 and 48 for a summary of threshold and upper targets for the 2008 and 2009 PSP awards : The 2008 award is subject to three equally-weighted performance measures: i the Companys total shareholder return TSR compared to the constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250: ii average adjusted earnings per share EPS : and iii average adjusted return on average capital employed ROACE.
For those senior executives working in one of the four Business Segments, the three measures equally weighted are TSR as above, average adjusted operating profit and average adjusted ROACE for the relevant segment.
The 2009 award is subject to two performance measures: i 80% of each award based on a TSR component as per above: and ii 20% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE.
For those senior executives working in one of the four Business Segments, the two measures are TSR and ROACE for the relevant segment.
