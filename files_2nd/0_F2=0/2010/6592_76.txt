85 6 Taxation continued e unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in relation to certain tax losses and other temporary differences on the basis that the Groups ability to utilise them in the future is uncertain.
The gross and tax values of these unrecognised assets together with any expiry periods, where relevant, are shown below.

f Pension partnership Note 26 refers to an asset-backed cash payment arrangement which the Group has agreed with the Trustee of the UK pension scheme.
as a result of this arrangement, the Group will obtain UK tax deductions spread over 4 years for the 331 million initial cash pension contribution.
over the next 2M years, the Group is also expected to obtain tax deductions for the remaining 269 million of the total amount likely to be paid to the UK pension scheme.
Where there is insufficient tax capacity to utilise these two types of tax deductions as they fall due, they will be carried forward as tax losses with the potential to be used to reduce future taxable profits in the UK.
as this arrangement has been put in place to fund a pension deficit which arose partly as a result of actuarial losses, the current tax benefits for the deductions will be reflected partly in other comprehensive income and partly in the income statement as they are utilised.
Current tax benefits of 17 million 3 million income statement: 14 million other comprehensive income have been recognised in the year in this respect.
a deferred tax asset of 26 million has been recognised on the balance sheet 5 million income statement: 21 million other comprehensive income in respect of the initial cash pension contribution.
Further deferred tax assets may become recognisable in the future.
Similar to the current tax credits referred to above, the deferred tax credits for these deferred tax assets are recognised partly in other comprehensive income and partly in the income statement.
g Changes in uK tax rate on 22 June 2M1M, the UK Government announced a number of tax measures in its emergency Budget, including a phased reduction in the mainstream rate of UK corporation tax from 28% to 24% over the next four years.
The first stage of these reductions, to 27%, had been enacted at the year end, with the result that the recognised UK deferred tax asset was valued at 27%.
as further reductions to reach the anticipated 24% rate are enacted, there will be a corresponding reduction in the value of UK deferred tax assets since deferred tax is measured at the prevailing tax rate.
Since a large part of the potential UK deferred tax asset currently remains unrecognised, there is not expected to be a material impact on the tax rate.
h Franked investment income litigation Since 2MM3 the Group has been involved in litigation with HMrC in respect of various advance corporation tax payments made and corporate tax paid on certain foreign dividend receipts which, in its view, were levied by HMrC in breach of the Groups eU community law rights.
During 2MM9, the Group received a 4 million payment on account from HMrC in respect of the litigation, but following a Court of appeal judgement issued on 23 February 2M1M 3 million of this payment on account was repaid to HMrC.
This has had no impact on the income statement.
a further Court of appeal hearing to decide whether the remaining payment on account should be repaid will take place in early 2M11.
The main case has been appealed both to the UK Supreme Court on effective remedies and to the european Court of Justice for further guidance on breach of community law and these judgements are not expected until late 2M11 early 2M12.
The continuing complexity of the case and uncertainty over the issues raised means that it is not possible to predict the final outcome of the litigation with any reasonable degree of certainty and, as a result, no contingent asset has been recognised.
