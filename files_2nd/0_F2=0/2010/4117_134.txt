Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following principal cash-generating units: Cash generating unit 2010 2009 000 000 Fresh Pork 12,231 - Cooked meats 85,655 86,903 sandwiches 16,526 16,526 Continental Fine Foods 10,968 10,968 other 3,359 3,359 128,739 117,756 Assumptions used the recoverable amount for each cash generating unit has been determined based on value in use calculations using annual budgets for each business for the following year, approved by the Board of Directors, and cash flow projections for the next four years.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure is included from budgets and thereafter capital is assumed to represent 100 per cent of depreciation.
subsequent cash flows are forecast to grow in line with an assumed long-term industry growth rate of between 3 and 5 per cent derived from third party market information, including K World Panel data.
A discount rate of 9.9 per cent has been used 2009 - 9.3 per cent being managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
the calculation is most sensitive to the following assumptions: sales volumes Gross margin Discount rate sales volumes are influenced by the growth of the underlying food segment, the market shares of our customers, selling prices, and the quality of our products and service.
historical volumes are used as the base and adjusted over the projection period in line with current growth rates.
Gross margin depends upon average selling prices, the cost of raw materials and changes in the cost of production overheads.
historical margins are used as the base, adjusted for managements expectations derived from experience and with reference to budget forecasts.
All calculations of this nature are sensitive to the discount rate used.
managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital has been used for each cash generating unit.
management believes that currently the assumptions used are unlikely to change to an extent which would reduce value in use below the value of the recoverable amount.
Assumptions and projections are updated on an annual basis.
