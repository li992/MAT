The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds: no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2007 and 1 April 2007 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 purposes for the periods to 31 January 2010, 1 February 2009, and 3 February 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
Following consultation with members and approval by the Board of Trustees, the Group became committed to the final proposals from the Pension Review on 2 July 2009.
The move from a final salary basis to career average revalued earnings CARE represents an accounting curtailment of certain pension liabilities.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits, the defined pension schemes obligations were revalued by the schemes actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date.
As a result a pensions credit of 91m has been recognised in comprehensive income during the year.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Pension Scheme gives the Trustees power to set the level of contributions.
In the Safeway Scheme this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 1 February 2010 is 42m 2009: 44m.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2010 65 21 PeNSIONS CONtINueD b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below.
The assumptions used at the valuation date of 2 July 2009, used in calculating the pension credit of 91m, remained the same as the prior year end 1 February 2009 apart from the discount rate, which reduced from 6.25% to 6.0%.
i Financial 2010 2009 2008 Rate of increases in salaries 4.855.85% 4.755.75% 5.006.00% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.60% 3.50% 3.75% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.65% 6.25% 5.75% Inflation assumption 3.60% 3.50% 3.75% ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Male 23.5 23.5 23.5 Female 25.8 25.8 25.8 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Male 22.2 22.2 22.2 Female 24.7 24.7 24.7 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45-year-old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65-year-old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as Long Cohort and is in-line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up to date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is PNX00 YOB 2009 and 2008: PNX00 YOB LC.
As disclosed in the Critical accounting assumptions on page 49, the results of the experience study conducted for the Safeway scheme have been used to adjust the longevity assumption for both schemes.
iii Expected return on assets The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.25% 7.00% 7.00% Corporate bonds 5.65% 6.00% 6.00% Gilts 4.35% 4.254.50% 4.254.50% Property related funds 5.65% 6.00% 6.00% Cash 1.50% 2.50% 5.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.

The allocation of assets between categories is governed by the Investment Principles of each scheme and is the responsibility of the trustees of each respective scheme.
The trustees should take due consideration of the Groups views and a representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committees.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 m m m Equities 798 592 1,040 Corporate bonds 636 547 237 Gilts 609 545 531 Property and property related funds 54 71 104 Cash 14 3 27 Total fair value of schemes assets 2,111 1,758 1,939 Present value of defined benefit funded obligation 2,128 1,807 2,007 Net pension liability recognised in the balance sheet 17 49 68 Related deferred tax asset note 20 5 14 19 Net deficit 12 35 49 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the year was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 1,758 1,939 1,774 Expected return on scheme assets 105 130 116 Actuarial gain loss recognised in other comprehensive income 245 425 113 Employer contributions 42 141 193 Employee contributions 10 10 10 Benefits paid 49 37 41 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 2,111 1,758 1,939 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the Parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
