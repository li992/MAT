186 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 Ore reserves And MinerAl resOurces coal continued estimates as at 31 December 2010 THErmal COal The Coal Reserve and Coal Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2007 and the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as applicable.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Coal Reserves and Coal Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
Anglo American Thermal Coal comprises the dominantly export and domestic thermal coal operations, located in Colombia and South Africa.
LOM Life of Mine in years based on scheduled Coal Reserves.
For the multi-product operations, the ROM tonnage figures apply to each product.
The Saleable tonnage cannot be calculated directly from the ROM reserve tonnage using the air dried yields as presented since the difference in moisture content is not taken into account.
Attributable percentages for country totals are weighted by Saleable tonnes and should not be directly applied to the ROM tonnage.
Additional footnotes appear at the end of the section.
export Thermal refers to lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for export in the use of power generation: quality measured by calorific value CV.
Other Metallurgical refers to semi soft, soft, hard, semi-hard or anthracite coal, other than Coking Coal, such as pulverized coal injection PCI or other general metallurgical coal for the export or domestic market with a wider range of properties than Coking Coal.
domestic Power refers to lowto high-volatile thermal or semi-soft coal primarily for domestic consumption for power generation: quality measured by calorific value CV.
synfuel refers to a coal specifically for the domestic production of synthetic fuel and chemicals: quality measured by calorific value CV.

Attributable percentages for country totals are weighted by Measured and Indicated MTIS.
1 Coal Reserves are quoted on a Run Of Mine ROM reserve tonnage basis which represents the tonnes delivered to the plant.
Saleable reserve tonnage represents the product tonnes produced.
Coal Reserves ROM and Saleable are on the applicable moisture basis.
For the 2009 Reported and Attributable figures, please refer to the 2009 Annual Report.
3 The tonnage is quoted as metric tonnes.
ROM tonnages on an As Delivered moisture basis, and Saleable tonnages on a Product moisture basis.
4 Yield ROM % represents the ratio of Saleable reserve tonnes to ROM reserve tonnes and is quoted on a constant moisture basis or on an air dried to air dried basis whereas Plant % is based on the Feed to Plant tonnes.
The product yields ROM % for Proved, Probable and Total are calculated by dividing the individual Saleable reserves by the total ROM reserves per classification.
5 The coal quality for the Coal Reserves is quoted as either Calorific Value CV using kilo-calories per kilogram kcal kg units on a Gross As Received GAR basis or Crucible Swell Number CSN.
Coal quality parameters for the Coal Reserves for Coking, Other Metallurgical and Export Thermal collieries meet the contractual specifications for coking coal, PCI, metallurgical coal, steam coal and domestic coal.
Coal quality parameters for the Coal Reserves for Domestic Power and Domestic Synfuels collieries meet the specifications of the individual supply contracts.
CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal kg and CSN to the nearest 0.5 index.
6 Coal Resources are quoted on a Mineable Tonnage In-Situ MTIS basis in million tonnes which are in addition to those resources which have been modified to produce the reported Coal Reserves.
Coal Resources are on an in-situ moisture basis.
7 The coal quality for the Coal Resources is quoted on an in-situ heat content as Calorific Value CV using kilo-calories per kilogram kcal kg units on a Gross As Received GAR basis.
CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal kg, 8 Inferred in LOM refers to Inferred Coal Resources that are included in the life of mine extraction schedule of the respective collieries and are not reported as Coal Reserves.
Inferred Coal Resources outside the LOM plan but within the mine lease area are not reported due to the uncertainty attached to such resources in that it cannot be assumed that all or part of the Inferred Resource will necessarily be upgraded to Indicated or Measured categories through continued exploration, such Inferred Resources do not necessarily meet the requirements of reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, particularly in respect of future mining and processing economics.
summary of material changes 10% at reporting level cerrjon: Increase in resources is due to the inclusion of previously excluded resources as a result of restrictions imposed by surface features 729 Mt.
Environmental and community restrictions fully stated and now included in the 2010 statement.
Re-evaluation of factors influencing economics and technical potential has resulted in the transfer of P500 project and related resource blocks to Coal Deposit -984 Mt.
isibonelo: As a consequence of the uncertainty associated with Environmental Management Programme Report EMPR approval, the Pit 4 Reserves were reallocated to Coal Deposit -8.7 Mt.
Transfer from underground resource to opencast reserve to be optimised by opencast mining -5.4 Mt.
Kriel: Conversion from resources to reserves 12.9 Mt.
Transfer of Block F non-dedicated resources from Kriel Colliery to Project Kriel Block F -54.2 Mt.
Mafube: Reclassification of Probable Reserves and Inferred Resources in Mine Plan to Coal Resources pending the approval for conversion of the Prospecting Right over Nooitgedacht and Wildfontein to a Mining Right -66.6 Mt.
new denmark: Due to inaccessibility of blocks, the Inferred Resources In Mine Plan were downgraded to Coal Deposit -12.0 Mt.
nooitgedacht: 5 Seam Coal Reserves were sterilised due to seam height restrictions -0.2 Mt.
Zibulo: Additional drilling information and increased geological confidence in the 2 seam has resulted in the upgrade of Inferred Resources in Mine Plan to Probable Reserve 13.8 Mt.
vaal Basin: Increased drilling and geological confidence resulted in an upgrade of Inferred Resources to Indicated and Measured Resources 200.3 Mt.
Previously referred to as Vaalbank elders: Increased drilling and geological confidence resulted in an upgrade of the Coal Deposit to Coal Resources 33.7 Mt.
Kriel Block F: Represents the non Eskom dedicated portion of the Kriel Mining Right, owned by Anglo Operations Limited.
new largo: Increased drilling and wash data resulted in an upgrade of Inferred Resources to Indicated and Measured Resources 142.1 Mt.
nooitgedacht: 2 4 Seam Update of the geological model resulted in upgrade to Measured Resource 12.9 Mt south rand: Increased drilling and geological confidence resulted in an upgrade of the Coal Deposit to Coal Resources 27.5 Mt.
Reclassification based on washability analysis rather than raw quality as reported in 2009 resulted in downgrade of resources -53.6 Mt.
Assumption with respect to Mineral Tenure Mafube: Coal Resources at Nooitgedacht and Wildfontein approximately 76 Mt Measured which are intended to be part of mine plan, are held as a Prospecting Right.
Application for conversion to a Mining Right will be submitted pending the completion of the Environmental Management Plan EMP.
Anglo American Thermal Coal has reasonable expectation that such conversion will not be withheld.
new largo: The interpretation of wetlands in the latest Mpumalanga Biodiversity Plan has been expanded and as such could affect the Mining Right application.
Anglo American has reasonable expectations that such permission will be granted.
Zibulo: The Mining Right has been granted and Probable Reserves will be converted to Proved Reserves in 2011. royalty Payment south Africa: Royalty payments commenced in February 2010 in accordance with the Royalties Act No.
28 of 2008 and have been taken into consideration in economic assessment of the reserves.
Reviews by independent third parties were carried out in 2010 on the following Operations and Project areas: Cerrejn, Greenside, New Denmark, New Largo, New Vaal.
