In June 2001, the Company established a stakeholder pension scheme, open to all employees, to which the Company makes matching contributions of a maximum of 5% of eligible earnings.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 m m m Stakeholder pension scheme 3 3 3 Life assurance scheme 2 1 1 Total costs 5 4 4 22 PROvISIONS Property provisions m At 1 February 2009 112 Charged to the income statement 3 Unused amounts reversed during the period 15 Utilised in period 6 Unwinding of discount 6 At 31 January 2010 100 Provisions comprise onerous leases provision, petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and provisions for dilapidations on leased buildings.
Onerous leases relate to sublet and vacant properties.
Where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, a provision based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall.
The lease commitments range from 1 to 62 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
As noted in the financial review, the amount reversed in the period primarily relates to a store that has been reopened as it fits well with our new smaller stores format and a number of tenants lease breakpoints being passed resulting in a continuing commitment from the tenant to continue the lease.
Other property provisions comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and dilapidations cost.
Provision is made for decommissioning costs for when the petrol filling station tanks reach the end of their useful life or when they become redundant and is based on the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks.
Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back to the condition in which it was originally leased.
Provision is made for these costs, which are incurred on termination of the lease.
