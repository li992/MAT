For any such leases, the Group provides for any shortfall between rent payable and rent receivable on any non-trading leased properties.
The provision is based on the period until the end of the lease, or on the estimated period until the Group can cover the shortfall by subletting, assigning or surrendering the lease.
The property provision also includes amounts for any related shortfalls in business rates on these properties, and for dilapidations, agents fees and other professional fees.
During the current period, the property provision has been increased by 0.2m arising from an unwinding of the discount rate over time.
None of this amount relates to a change in the discount rate.
There is a discussion of the main sources of estimation and uncertainty which apply to this provision at note 3 to the consolidated Group accounts.
The amount of the expected future cash flows have been adjusted to reflect the expected range of possibilities and, as the outflows under this provision are expected to take place over a number of years, the provision has been discounted to its present value.
Other provisions relate to amounts due in respect of contractual terminations.
