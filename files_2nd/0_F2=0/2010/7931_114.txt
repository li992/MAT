Reimbursement of 27 million received in cash and 14 million of costs settled directly by the sellers on behalf of the Group have been treated as an adjustment to the cost of the Reemtsma acquisition and so are reflected as a reduction in goodwill of 41 million in note 9.
To the extent that costs were settled directly by the sellers they have been shown as a non-cash movement of 14 million to arrive at operating cash flow before movement in working capital in note 25.
Costs of 24 million incurred in 2010 have been recognised in the 2010 consolidated income statement in administrative and other expenses, and have been excluded from our adjusted performance measures since the costs do not relate to the current trading performance of the Group.
We have not restated our adjusted measures for prior years as the costs incurred were not significant in any individual year.
2009 On 7 October 2008 the Group paid deferred consideration of US$81 million 46 million to acquire the outstanding 49 per cent minority shareholdings in 800 JR Cigar and MCM Management.
The holding was already 100 per cent consolidated as control was obtained in prior periods.
