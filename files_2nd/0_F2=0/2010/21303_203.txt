com annualreport10 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31st December 2010 continued 41 Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable willing parties.
Comparison of carrying amounts and fair values The following table summarises the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities presented on the Groups balance sheet, and their fair values differentiating between financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost.

com annualreport10 251 41 Fair value of financial instruments continued Valuation inputs IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires an entity to classify its financial instruments held at fair value according to a hierarchy that reects the signicance of observable market inputs.
The classication of a financial instrument is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are dened below.
Quoted market prices Level 1 Financial instruments are classied as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
This category includes exchange traded government bonds, actively traded listed equities and actively exchange-traded derivatives.
Valuation technique using observable inputs Level 2 Financial instruments classied as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an active market.
Valuations based on observable inputs include financial instruments such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
This category includes most investment grade and liquid high yield bonds, certain asset backed securities, US agency securities, government bonds, less actively traded listed equities, bank, corporate and municipal obligations, certain OTC derivatives, certain convertible bonds, certicates of deposit, commercial paper, certain collateralised debt obligations CDOs cash and synthetic underlyings, collateralised loan obligations CLOs, most commodities based derivatives, credit derivatives, certain credit default swaps CDSs, most fund units, certain loans, foreign exchange spot and forward ransactions and certain issued notes.
Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Financial instruments are classied as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Such inputs are generally determined based on observable inputs of a similar nature, historical observations on the level of the input or other analytical techniques.
This category includes certain corporate debt securities, distressed debt, private equity investments, commercial real estate loans, certain OTC derivatives requiring complex and unobservable inputs such as correlations and long dated volatilities, certain convertible bonds, some CDOs cash and synthetic underlyings, credit default swaps, derivative exposures to Monoline insurers, fund units, certain asset backed securities, certain issued notes, certain collateralised loan obligations CLOs and certain loans.

This resulted from a change in the accounting treatment from loans and advances to available for sale financial instruments.
This classication is due to the uncertainty inherent in any litigation, rather than uncertainty relating to the valuation of the assets themselves.
In addition, a further 1.0bn was transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 due to unobservable valuation inputs becoming significant to the overall valuation of certain xed rate loans.

These methodologies are commonly used by market participants.
The valuation techniques used for the main products that are not determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices Level 1, are described below.
Commercial real estate loans This category includes lending on a range of commercial property types including retail, hotels, ofce and development properties.
Fair value is calculated using a risk adjusted spread based methodology performed on a loan by loan basis with consideration of characteristics such as property type, geographic location, yields, credit quality and property performance reviews.
The valuation inputs are reviewed with reference to published bond indices.
Initial spreads are sourced from market quoted origination spreads by property type and classied into Loan-to-Value LTV buckets which are adjusted for internal credit rating and subordination of the loans.
The internal credit ratings used in the valuation model are subject to a monthly review process.
The model is calibrated monthly based on external quotes of new origination property type spreads and the latest internal credit ratings.
The valuations are considered unobservable due to the bespoke nature of the instruments.
Asset backed products These are debt and derivative products that are linked to the cash ows of a pool of referenced assets.
This category includes asset backed loans, CDOs cash underlyings, CLOs, asset backed credit derivatives, asset and mortgage backed securities.
Valuations are determined using industry standard cash ow models that calculate fair value based on loss projections, prepayment, recovery and discount rates.
These parameters are determined by reference to underlying collateral performance, independent research, ABX indices, broker quotes, observable trades on similar securities and third party pricing sources.
Within this population, certain valuation inputs are unobservable for non-investment grade ABS, non-agency residential mortgage backed securities RMBS and asset backed credit derivatives.
Where unobservable, a parameter will be set with reference to an observable proxy.
The determination of parameter levels takes account of a range of factors such as deal vintage, underlying asset composition historical losses, borrower characteristics, various loan attributes such as loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios and geographic concentration, credit ratings original and current, home price changes and interest rates.
com annualreport10 257 41 Fair value of financial instruments continued Other credit products These products are linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities.
This category includes synthetic CDOs, single name and index CDS and Nth to default basket swaps.
Within this population, valuation inputs are unobservable for CDS with illiquid reference assets and certain synthetic CDOs.
A market standard model is used in the valuation of CDS whereby the credit curve is the significant input in the overall valuation.
Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.
Where credit spreads are unobservable, they are determined with reference to recent transactions or bond spreads from observable issuances of the same issuer or other similar entities as a proxy.
Synthetic CDOs are valued using a model that calculates fair value based on observable and unobservable parameters including credit spreads, recovery rates, correlations and interest rates and is calibrated daily.
For index and bespoke synthetic CDOs with unobservable inputs, correlation is set with reference to index tranche market.
Derivative exposure to Monoline insurers These products are derivatives through which default protection has been purchased on securities, primarily CLOs.
The credit spreads of the counterparty providing protection are unobservable at the required maturity.
The derivative positions are valued with reference to the price of the underlying security.
As the security and derivative are hedged, the net present value of the derivative increases as the net present value of the security decreases.
The derivative valuation is then adjusted to reect the credit quality of the counterparty.
Non-asset backed debt instruments These are government bonds, US agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certicates of deposit, convertible bonds, notes and other non-asset backed bonds.
Within this population, valuation inputs are unobservable for certain convertible bonds, corporate bonds and issued notes.
Exchange traded government bonds are classied as Level 1.
Less liquid, government bonds, US agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certicates of deposit are valued using observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
Where there are not observable market prices, fair value is determined by reference to either issuances or CDS spreads of the same issuer as proxy inputs to obtain discounted cash ows to value the bond.
In the absence of observable bond or CDS spreads for the respective issuer, similar reference assets or sector averages are applied as a proxy.
Convertible bonds are valued using prices observed through broker sources, market data services and trading activity.
Prices are validated against liquid external sources.
Where liquid external sources are not available, fair value is determined using a spread to the equity conversion value or the value of the bond without the additional equity conversion.
The spread level is determined with reference to similar proxy assets.
Most xed and oating rate notes issued are valued using models that discount expected future cash ows.
These models calculate fair value based on observable interest rates and funding or credit spreads.
The interest rates are derived from broker and bank notes rates.
In certain emerging markets, funding spreads may be unobservable.
Funding spreads up to five years are sourced from negotiable commercial deposit rates in the market as a proxy.
Funding spreads greater than five years are determined by applying extrapolation techniques.
Equity Linked Notes valuations are determined using industry standard models.
The models calculate fair value based on input parameters such as stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repo curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.
In general, input parameters are observable, with unobservable inputs having an insignicant impact on the valuation.
The valuation for fund linked notes is consistent with the valuation of the underlying see the Funds and fundlinked products section below.
Equity products This category includes listed equities, exchange traded equity derivatives, OTC equity derivatives, preference shares and contracts for difference.
OTC equity derivatives valuations are determined using industry standard models.
In general, input parameters are deemed observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying instrument.
Unobservable model inputs are set by reference to liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the risk prole of the trading portfolio.
These are validated against consensus market data services for the same or similar underlying instrument.
Private equity Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
This requires the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, discounted cashow analysis, and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed comparative companies.
Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Model inputs are based on market conditions at the reporting date.
The valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature.
However, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.
Full valuations are performed bi-annually, with the portfolio reviewed on a monthly basis for material events that might impact upon fair value.
258 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2010 www.
com annualreport10 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31st December 2010 continued 41 Fair value of financial instruments continued Funds and fund-linked products This category includes holdings in hedge funds, funds of funds, and fund derivatives.
Fund derivatives are derivatives whose underlyings include mutual funds, hedge funds, fund indices and multi-asset portfolios.
They are valued using underlying fund prices, yield curves and other available market information.
In general fund holdings are valued based on the latest available valuation received from the fund administrator.
Funds are deemed unobservable where the fund is either suspended, in wind-down, has a redemption restriction that severely affects liquidity, or where the latest net asset value from the fund administrators is more than three months old.
In the case of illiquid fund holdings the valuation will take account of all available information in relation to the underlying fund or collection of funds and maybe adjusted relative to the performance of relevant index benchmarks.
Foreign exchange products These products are derivatives linked to the foreign exchange market.
This category includes forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options.
Exotic derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models.
Fair value is based on input parameters that include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and other model parameters.
Certain correlations and long dated forward and volatilities are unobservable.
Unobservable model inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the risk prole of the trading portfolio.
These are validated against consensus market data services.
Interest rate products These are products linked to interest rates or ination indices.
This category includes interest rate and ination swaps, swaptions, caps, oors, ination options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.
Interest rate products are valued using standard discounted cash ow techniques.
Interest rate derivative cash ows are valued using interest rates yield curves whereby observable market data is used to construct the term structure of forward rates.
This is then used to project and discount future cash ows based on the parameters of the trade.
An instrument with optionality is valued using a volatility surface constructed from market observable inputs.
Exotic interest rate derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models based on observable market parameters which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying instrument.
For ination swaps, the ination adjusted yield curve is the most significant input in the overall valuation.
In an ination swap, an ination based cash ow is swapped for either a xed or oating interest rate cash ow.
Flows on the ination leg of the trades are projected using the relevant ination forward curve and discounted.
Any oating rates will be projected using the relevant interest rate yield curve and discounted.
Ination forward curves and interest rate yield curves are extrapolated beyond observable tenors and veried against any available market data.
Balance guaranteed swaps are valued using industry standard cash ow models that calculate fair value based on loss projections, prepayment, recovery and discount rates.
These parameters are determined by reference to underlying asset performance, independent research, ABX indices, broker quotes, observable trades on similar securities and third party pricing sources.
Prepayment is projected based on observing historic prepayment.
During 2010, in line with changes in market practice, the methodology for valuing certain collateralised interest rate products was updated to make use of more relevant interest rate yield curves to discount cash ows.
For certain collateralised vanilla swaps, ination derivatives and other linear xed income derivatives Overnight Indexed Swap OIS rates were used rather than other market reference rates such as LIBOR.
Commodity products These products are exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on an underlying commodity such as metals, oil and oil related, agriculturals, power and natural gas.
Valuation inputs of certain commodity swaps and options are determined using models incorporating discounting of cash ows and other industry standard modelling techniques.
Fair value is calculated using inputs such as forward curves, volatility surfaces and tenor correlation.
Unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products or by applying extrapolation techniques from the observable market.
Other This category is largely made up of xed rate loans, which are valued using models that discount expected future cash ows.
These models calculate the fair value based on observable interest rates and unobservable funding or credit spreads.
Unobservable funding or credit spreads are determined by applying extrapolation of observable spreads.
The receivables resulting from the acquisition of the North American businesses of Lehman Brothers is included within Other.

com annualreport10 259 41 Fair value of financial instruments continued Fair value adjustments The main adjustments to model or system balances to arrive at a fair value are described below: Bid-Offer valuation adjustments Portfolios are valued to reect the most advantageous market price to which Barclays has immediate access.
For assets and liabilities where the rm is not a market maker, mid prices are adjusted to bid and offer prices respectively.
The bid-offer adjustment factors reect the expected close out strategy and, for derivatives, that they are managed on a portfolio basis.
The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio will generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk by strike and term in accordance with hedging strategy.
Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data, and are reviewed periodically.
For those assets and liabilities where the rm is a market maker which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a transaction cost, mid prices are used.
Uncertainty adjustments Market data input for exotic derivatives may not have a directly observable bid offer spread.
In such instances, an uncertainty adjustment is applied as a proxy for the bid offer adjustment.
An example of this is correlation risk where an adjustment is required to reect the possible range of values that market participants apply.
The uncertainty adjustment may be determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario analysis or historical analysis.
Model Valuation adjustments New valuation models are reviewed under the rms Trade Approval Procedures and Model Validation Policy.
This process identies the assumptions used and any model limitations for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew.
Where necessary, fair value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account.
Model valuation adjustments are dependant on the size of portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market standard and to what extent it incorporates all known risk factors.
All models and model valuation adjustments are subject to review on at least an annual basis.
Credit and debit valuation adjustments Credit valuation adjustments CVAs and Debit valuation adjustments DVAs are incorporated into derivative valuations to reect the impact on the fair value of counterparty risk and Barclays own credit quality respectively.
These adjustments are modelled for OTC derivatives across all asset classes.
Probability of Default PD and Loss Given Default LGD are applied to expected exposures at a counterparty level to arrive at a CVA and DVA adjustment.
Monoline credit valuation adjustments Barclays determines its internal credit ratings for Monolines based upon its independent, fundamental credit analysis in conjunction with a cross reference to external ratings where available.
These internal credit ratings can, and at times do, differ from the publicly available ratings.
For Monolines where a default has either occurred, is imminent or there is a possibility of regulatory intervention, an adjustment may be made to the internal credit rating.
This will be based on the estimated recovery from a range of potential scenarios.
The PD used to calculate the CVA is derived from the relevant internal credit rating and is based on internal simulations of credit factor indices by region and industry designations, calibrated to historical time-series and forecast on the basis of current values.
The LGD used is a function of available historical data, the Monolines credit quality and risk concentration, and recovery values observed in executed commutation settlements.
The CVA for all Monolines is based upon an expected exposure methodology.
Expected exposure is calculated by simulating default losses on the underlying assets, calibrated to market observable parameters and forward looking market research.
This exposure is then further adjusted for any spread between prices derived from observable proxies.
Barclays will then apply the PD of the Monoline to this expected exposure and multiply the result by the LGD to determine the CVA for each Monoline.

com annualreport10 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31st December 2010 continued 41 Fair value of financial instruments continued Other credit and debit valuation adjustments Derivative CVAs and DVAs for non-Monoline exposures are calculated using Monte-Carlo simulation to generate an expected exposure prole.
The expected exposure is calculated at a counterparty level after netting and collateral are applied.
The PD and LGD are derived from a combination of single name credit default swap prices where observable, industry curves, indices, and loan note pricing taking into account geographic factors, internal credit ratings, loss assumptions and ratings agency data.
For counterparties with an observable credit market, the PD and LGD are derived from single name credit default swap prices.
For counterparties with no observable credit market, the PD and LGD are derived from either a generic or a specic curve.
The PD and LGD is derived from internal credit ratings and the appropriate geographic index.
Specic curves will incorporate any relevant additional factors into the generic curve.
Where the curve is unobservable and the CVA is significant to the overall value of the underlying derivative, the full value of the derivative and its associated credit valuation adjustment is deemed unobservable.
CVAs are not incorporated into the fair value of certain counterparties where it has been observed that the market does not apply a credit charge.
The categories of counterparties excluded are as follows: Strongly collateralised counterparties this is any counterparty with a collateral agreement with minimum weekly calls and the collateral threshold plus minimum transfer amount below a dened level: Certain highly-rated sovereigns, supra-nationals and government agencies: and Liquidity providers when trading on the interbank market with certain collateralised market making counterparties no counterparty spreads are applied.
Where counterparty credit quality and exposure to that counterparty are linked, wrong way risk may arise.
In these instances, wrong way risk suggests that exposure to the counterparty is likely to increase as counterparty credit quality deteriorates.
Exposure to wrong way risk is limited via internal governance processes and deal pricing.
Barclays Capital uses credit default swap spreads to determine the impact of Barclays own credit quality on the fair value of derivative liabilities.
At 31st December 2010, cumulative adjustments of 352m 31st December 2009: 307m were recorded against derivative liabilities.
The impact of these adjustments in both periods was more than offset by the impact of the credit valuation adjustments to reect counterparty creditworthiness that were netted against derivative assets.
Own credit adjustments The carrying amount of issued notes that are designated under the IAS 39 fair value option is adjusted to reect the effect of changes in own credit spreads.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
For funded instruments such as issued notes, credit spreads on Barclays issued bonds represent the most appropriate basis for this adjustment.
At 31st December 2010, the own credit adjustment arose from the fair valuation of 96.0bn 31st December 2009: 86.0bn of Barclays Capitals financial liabilities designated at fair value.
Barclays credit spreads widened during 2010, leading to a profit of 391m 2009: loss 1,820m from the fair value of changes primarily in own credit but also from the effects of foreign exchange rates, time decay and trade activity.
com annualreport10 261 41 Fair value of financial instruments continued Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs The amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price the fair value at initial recognition and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, was as follows: 2010 2009 Year ended 31st December m m Opening balance 99 128 Additions 56 39 Amortisation and releases 18 68 Closing balance 137 99 Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs Fair value Favourable changes Unfavourable changes Total Total profit profit assets liabilities and loss Equity and loss Equity Product type m m m m m m As at 31st December 2010 Commercial real estate loans 5,424 183 167 Asset backed products 4,628 1,912 317 11 289 11 Other credit products 1,097 1,318 38 66 Derivative exposure to Monoline insurers 1,449 78 230 Non-asset backed debt instruments 2,956 2,719 56 55 Equity products 1,478 1,895 156 8 154 8 Private equity 2,844 279 111 280 69 Funds and fund-linked products 1,084 275 275 Foreign exchange products 506 241 51 52 Interest rate products 2,407 1,079 38 52 Commodity products 493 629 30 55 Other 4,651 199 51 55 Total 29,017 9,992 1,552 130 1,730 88 As at 31st December 2009 Commercial real estate loans 7,170 429 437 Asset backed products 5,840 2,334 175 4 175 4 Other credit products 2,020 2,827 171 152 Derivative exposure to Monoline insurers 2,027 336 532 Non-asset backed debt instruments 3,127 3,202 145 2 141 2 Equity products 1,536 1,922 28 15 28 15 Private equity 1,978 267 73 339 95 Funds and fund-linked products 1,241 100 100 Foreign exchange products 761 379 33 33 Interest rate products 2,357 1,775 78 78 Commodity products 748 581 36 36 Other 1,451 52 52 Total 30,256 13,020 1,850 94 2,103 116 As part of risk management processes, an analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable parameters Level 3 to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
The effect of stressing unobservable inputs to a range of reasonably possible alternatives would be to increase fair values by up to 1.7bn 2009: 1.9bn or to decrease fair values by up to 1.8bn 2009: 2.2bn with substantially all the potential effect impacting profit and loss rather than equity.
The stresses applied take account of the nature of valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historic data.
Sensitivity methodologies are based on a range, standard deviation or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on alternative market views.
The level of shift or scenarios applied is considered for each product and varied according to the quality of the data and variability of underlying market.
The approach adopted in determining these sensitivities has continued to evolve during the year, in the context of changing market conditions.
262 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2010 www.
com annualreport10 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31st December 2010 continued 41 Fair value of financial instruments continued Commercial real estate loans Unobservable inputs include, but are not limited to, market quoted origination spreads, internal credit ratings and loan subordination.
The sensitivity is determined by applying a - 3% shift for each underlying position based on the largest upward and downward price movement of observable published indices of a similar nature in the preceding 12-month period.
Asset backed products For non-agency RMBS, non-investment grade MBS, mortgage related asset backed credit derivatives and other ABS, the price movements on appropriate indices are used.
Sensitivity is based on the average of the largest upward and downward price movement in the preceding 12-month period.
Other credit products The sensitivity of valuations of the illiquid CDS portfolio is determined by applying a - 0.2% stress to the DV01 for each underlying reference asset.
The stress is based upon the average bid offer spreads observed in the market for similar CDS.
Derivative exposure to Monoline insurers The main unobservable input for these exposures is the credit quality of the relevant Monoline insurers.
The approach to determine sensitivity is dependent on the credit quality of the Monoline insurer.
Sensitivity is computed by shifting the internal credit rating of the Monoline insurer based on scenario analysis determined by evaluating estimated counterparty ratings in the event of a decline in the market environment.
Non-asset backed debt instruments The sensitivity for convertible bonds, is determined by applying a - 1% shift to each underlying position.
This shift is based upon the bid offer spreads observed in the market for similar bonds.
The sensitivity for corporate bonds portfolio is determined by applying a - 1% shift to each underlying position.
This shift is based upon a multiplier to the average bid offer spreads observed in the market for similar bonds.
The sensitivity for xed and oating rate notes is calculated using a - 1% shift in credit spreads.
Equity products The sensitivity is estimated based on the dispersion of consensus data services either directly or through proxies.
Private equity The relevant valuation models are sensitive to each of a number of key assumptions, such as projected future earnings, comparator multiples, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Valuation sensitivity is estimated by exing such assumptions to reasonable alternative levels and determining the impact on the resulting valuation.
Funds and fund-linked products The sensitivity is calculated on an individual fund basis using a loss based scenario approach which factors in the underlying assets of the specic fund and assumed recovery rates.
Foreign exchange products The sensitivity is based on the statistical spread of consensus data services, calculated using 2 standard deviations of the mid correlation dispersion.
com annualreport10 263 41 Fair value of financial instruments continued Interest rate products Uncertainty relating to the valuation of the products is mainly driven from the range and the standard deviation of the consensus data used for price testing.
For base rate derivatives, the sensitivity is based on bid offer spreads of base rates swaps.
The sensitivity was determined by applying a - 0.12% shift on the net PV01.
Commodity products Sensitivity is determined primarily by measuring historical variability over two years.
The estimate has been calculated using data for short dated parameter curves to generate best and worst case scenarios.
Where historical data is unavailable or uncertainty is due to volumetric risk, sensitivity is measured by applying appropriate stress scenarios or using proxy bid-offer spread levels.
Other The sensitivity for xed rate loans is calculated using a - 1% shift in credit spreads, except for certain loans within Barclays Corporate where the sensitivity is calculated using a shift in credit spreads of - 0.02% 0.11%.
No stress has been applied to the receivables relating to the Lehman acquisition.
As outlined in Note 26, it is possible to identify a maximum loss.
However, due to the uncertainty inherent in such legal proceedings, it is not possible to identify reasonable upside and downside stresses on a basis comparable with the other assets analysed.
Valuation control framework The Independent Valuation Control function is responsible for independent price verication, oversight of fair value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues.
This process covers all fair value positions and is a key control in ensuring the material accuracy of valuations.
Price verication uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market.
The reliability of the data source is assessed in determining the independent valuation.
The characteristics against which the data source is assessed are independence, reliability, consistency with other sources and evidence that the data represents an executable price.
The most current data available at balance sheet date is used.
Where significant variances are noted in the independent price verication process, an adjustment is taken to the fair value position.
Additional fair value adjustments may be taken to reect such factors as bid-offer spreads, market data uncertainty, model limitations and counterparty risk.
Independent price verication results and fair value adjustments are reported on a monthly basis to the Valuation Committee.
This committee is responsible for overseeing valuation and fair value adjustment policy within Barclays Capital and this is the forum to which valuation issues are escalated.
The Valuation Committee delegates more detailed review to the following five Sub-Committees: Independent Valuations, Primary Commercial Real Estate, Available for Sale and Other Assets, Models and Governance.
The Independent Valuations sub-committee reviews the results of the independent price verication and fair value adjustments process on a monthly basis.
This includes, but is not limited to, reviewing fair value adjustments and methodologies, independent price verication results, limits and valuation uncertainty.
The Primary Commercial Real Estate and Available for Sale and Other Assets sub-committees focus on independent price verication results specic to the asset classes.
The Available for Sale and Other Assets sub-committee also assesses contingent risks and examines counterparty related issues.
The Models sub-committee is responsible for overseeing policies and controls related to the use of valuation models.
This includes but is not limited to reviewing i global model risk reports and dening associated procedures and controls ii output from pipeline meetings and approximate booking meetings, and the trade approval process iii issues arising from model review iv population of valuation adjustments v dening policies and procedures relating to valuation models and vi instances of independent price verication variances or collateral disputes relating to model usage.
The Governance sub-committee is responsible for the governance of valuation processes, policies and procedures.
This sub-committee oversees each sub-committee to ensure that the objectives set out in each committees terms of reference are being achieved.
Regulatory and accounting issues related to fair value are also assessed by the Governance sub-committee.
