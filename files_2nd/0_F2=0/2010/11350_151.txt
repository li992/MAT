The expected rate of return on equities represents a 3% premium of the yield on long term Government bonds at 31 March 2010.
The gross redemption yield on index linked UK Government stocks was 0.7%.
The long term inflation rate implied by these yields is 3.8% which has been reduced by 0.1% to allow for an inflation risk premium.
Mortality rates have been based on the PA00 tables, applying medium cohort adjustment of 115% loading to mortality rates based on the year of birth of membership.

The Group made contributions amounting to 0.8 million 2009: 0.5 million to the defined benefit pension scheme.
Sensitivity to key assumptions: IAS 1 requires disclosure of the sensitivity of the results to the methods and assumptions used.
The costs of a pension arrangement require estimates regarding future experience.
The financial assumptions used for IAS 19 reporting are the responsibility of the directors of the Company.
These assumptions reflect market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Changes in market conditions which result in changes in the net discount rate essentially the difference between the discount rate and the assumed rates of increases of salaries, deferred pension revaluation or pensions in payment, can have a significant effect on the value of the liabilities reported.
A reduction in the net discount rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities, as a higher value is placed on benefits paid in the future.
A rise in the net discount rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.
The overall effect of a change in the net discount rate of 0.1% would change the liabilities by around 14.4 million.
There is also uncertainty around life expectancy for the UK population.
The value of current and future pension benefits will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.
The disclosures have been prepared using the mortality assumptions adopted for the 2007 formal valuation namely the PCMA PCFA00 tables, applying a medium cohort adjustment with a 115% loading to mortality rates based on the year of birth of the membership.
These assumptions imply an assumed life expectancy for a member aged 65 at 31 March 2010 of 20.7 years 2009: 20.6 years for males and 23.0 years 2009: 22.9 years for females.
The effect of increasing the assumed life expectancies by one year would be to increase the value of liabilities by around 2.8%.
