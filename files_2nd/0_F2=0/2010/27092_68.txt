In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the above tables provide an analysis of these investments based on the fair value hierarchy described below, which reflects the reliability and significance of the information used to measure their fair value.
Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy used to analyse the fair values of financial assets is described below.
The levels are determined by the lowest that is the least reliable or least independently observable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows: Level 1 investments with quoted prices in an active market: Level 2 investments whose fair value is based directly on observable current market prices or is indirectly being derived from market prices: and Level 3 investments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by observable current market prices or are not based on observable market data.
The purchases and sales proceeds figures above include transaction costs of 1,016,000 2009 581,000 and 252,000 2009 376,000 respectively.
Of the realised gains on sales of fixed asset investments during the year of 59,411,000 2009 losses of 83,336,000, a net gain of 578,000 2009 gain of 151,491,000 was included in investment holding gains losses at the previous year end.
The following table shows a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for fair value measurements in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: Value at Purchases Gains on Holding Value at 1 May 2009 amortisation Sales Sales gains 30 April 2010 000 000 000 000 000 000 Listed debt securities 36,396 21,561 34,550 7,377 12,448 43,232 Unlisted equities 736 807 13,134 13,207 2 Unlisted debt securities 3,564 414 3,150 40,696 21,561 35,357 5,757 25,241 46,384 Purchases amortisation for listed debt includes amortisation of fixed income securities of 218,000.
