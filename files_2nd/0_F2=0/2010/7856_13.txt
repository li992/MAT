Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting Policies General Imagination Technologies Group plc is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
Significant accounting policies Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 78 to 81.
Basis of preparation The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The following new standards and amendments to standards as adopted by the European Union at 30 April 2010 are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 May 2009: IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
IFRS 8 supersedes IAS 14, 'Segmental reporting'.
It requires a 'management approach' under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the board of directors that make strategic decisions.
The revised standard has not had a material impact on the group.
Comparatives for 2009 have been restated accordingly.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
In accordance with the standard the group presents in the consolidated statement of changes in equity all owner changes in equity, whereas all non-owner changes in equity are presented in two separate statements, the consolidated income statement displaying components of profit and loss and a consolidated statement of comprehensive income displaying components of comprehensive income.
The change in accounting policy only impacts presentation aspects and comparatives for 2009 have been restated accordingly.
Amendments to IFRS 2 Share based payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations.
This revision of an existing standard deals with vesting conditions and cancellations.
It clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
The amendment to the standard has not had a material impact on the group.
This revision of an existing standard requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
IFRS 7 Amendment 'Financial instruments, disclosures'.
The amendments provide enhanced disclosure about fair value measurements and reinforce existing principles for disclosures about liquidity risk.
The amendment to the standard has resulted in some changes to disclosures in the annual report.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below under Significant accounting judgements and estimates.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the trade investments have been stated at fair value in accordance with IAS 39.
Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
The Group has adequate financial resources together with long term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across a range of consumer market segments and geographic areas.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
55 Further information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Chief Executives Review on pages 3 to 10.
Further information regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in notes 14 and 16.
In addition, note 20 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Revenue Revenue comprises: 1 the value of consideration received in return for license fees, development income, maintenance and royalties from license and development agreements: 2 revenues from the sale of products to support technology licensees: and 3 revenues from the sale of systems products utilising the Groups technology to third parties.
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Revenue from licenses is recognized on delivery to the customer.
Revenue on licence agreements for products which are either not finished or which need to be modified to meet specific customer requirements is recognized on a  basis over the period from starting development of the product to delivery.
The  is measured by monitoring progress compared with the total estimated project requirement.
Progress is measured by an assessment of performance against key development milestones.
Revenue associated with rights in license agreements to unspecified current and future products is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement.
Revenue on development work is recognized on a  basis over the period from the start of the development to delivery.
Development work is normally invoiced as milestones are achieved.
Where invoicing milestones on licence or development arrangements are such that the proportion of work performed is greater than the proportion of the total contract value which has been invoiced, the Group evaluates whether it has obtained, through its performance to date, the right to the uninvoiced consideration and therefore whether revenue should be recognized.
In particular it considers whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice milestones will be achieved in the expected timeframe, that the customer considers that the Groups contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled and that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will be incurred.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group, taking into account these criteria, revenue is not recognized until there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Revenue for maintenance is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which maintenance is contractually agreed with the licensee.
The excess of licence fees, development income and maintenance invoiced over revenue recognized is recorded as deferred income.
Royalty revenues are earned on the sale by licensees of products containing the Groups technology.
Revenues are recognized as they are earned to the extent that the Group has sufficient evidence of sales of products containing the Groups technology by licensees.
Revenues from the sale of products to support technology licensees and systems products utilising the Groups technology to third parties are recognized upon delivery and are accounted for net of VAT, discounts and returns.
Returns are recognized at the point at which the Group has adequate knowledge that products are likely to be returned by a customer.
56 Research and development costs Costs of basic and applied research are written off in the period in which they are incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalized where it relates to a specific project where technical and commercial feasibility has been established, adequate technical, financial and other resources exist to complete the project, the expenditure attributable to the project can be measured reliably and future economic benefits are probable.
In this case, it is recognized as an intangible asset and amortized over its useful economic life.
All other development expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred after the establishment of technical feasibility and overall project and commercial profitability have not been significant and, therefore, no costs have been capitalized to date.
Operating leases Rental charges in respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Employee benefits The Group contributes to a defined contribution pension plan.
Payments are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Share-based payment transactions The share option programmes and the Share Incentive arrangements allow Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of Share Incentives is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the Share Incentives.
The fair value of the Share Incentives granted is measured using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo Simulation models.
The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of Share Incentives that vest except where forfeiture is due only to market-based performance conditions not meeting the threshold for vesting.
For the Share Appreciation Rights, cash bonuses are calculated by reference to the value of shares.
The fair value of these bonuses is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as personnel expense in the income statement.
Transactions of the Group-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchase of shares in the Company is debited directly in equity to retained earnings.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The following temporary difference is not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized.
Foreign exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses are taken to the income statement.
On consolidation, results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year.
The assets and liabilities are translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from retranslation have been recognised directly in the translation reserve within equity.
This reserve was set to zero at 1st April 2004.
Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the groups other components.
57 All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the board of directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Intangible assets Software, trademarks and patents are capitalized as intangible assets at cost of acquisition and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, between 3 and 5 years.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition and amortized over their estimated useful economic lives.
Trade investments Trade investments are classed as available for sale and are stated on the balance sheet at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognized directly in equity in the revaluation reserve, except for impairment losses.
When these investments are derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized directly in equity is recognized in profit or loss.
The fair value of unquoted investments is made by reference to recent funding rounds or, in the absence of the former, to a discounted cash-flow forecast.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid or payable over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions is capitalized.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units expected to benefit from the acquisition and is reviewed annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognized immediately in the income statement and may not be subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or business, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is stated on the balance sheet at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Business combinations that took place prior to 1st April 2004 have not been re-stated and goodwill represents the amount recognized under the Groups previous accounting framework.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated to write down their cost using the straight line method to their estimated residual values over the period of their estimated useful economic lives.
Periodic reviews are made of estimated remaining useful economic lives and residual values, and the depreciation rates applied are: Freehold land No depreciation Freehold buildings 2 per cent on cost Leasehold improvements Equally over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10 per cent to 33 per cent on cost Motor vehicles 25 per cent on cost Impairment Non-financial assets Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such condition exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, estimates are made of the cashflows of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and value in use.
In assessing value in use, estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate appropriate to the specific asset or cash generating unit.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying value of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 58 impairment loss had been recognized.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Financial assets A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its current fair value.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis.
The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.
Any cumulative gain or loss in respect of an available-forsale financial asset recognized previously in equity is transferred to the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognized in profit or loss.
For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the reversal is recognized directly in equity.
Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventory is calculated using the FIFO method.
Finished goods include direct costs and attributable overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Cash and equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of less than or equal to three months.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Long Term Borrowing Long term borrowings are recognized initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, long term borrowings are stated at amortized cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates In applying the Groups accounting policies described above, management has made the following judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in the financial statements: Revenue Recognition The Group has made estimates on the  for licensing and development work which affect the amount of revenue recognized in the period.
Share based payments A charge of 3,268,000 2009: 1,766,000 has been expensed for Share Incentives.
The fair value of the Share Incentives is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the incentives.
The fair value of the Share Incentives is measured using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo Simulation models which take into account the terms and conditions upon which the award was made.
In determining the appropriate expense, the Group has made estimates on the likelihood that internal performance targets will be achieved and on the number of employees that will be employed on vesting.
Details of share-based payments and the assumptions applied are disclosed in Note 22.
Taxation The Group has a recognized deferred tax asset of 11,018,000 2009: 5,460,000 and an unrecognized deferred tax asset of 13,208,000 2009: 12,533,000.
A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilize the temporary difference.
The Group has made estimates on the likelihood that future taxable profit will utilize these tax losses.
59 Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at a minimum on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit that holds the goodwill at a determined discount rate and an appropriate growth rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Details of assumptions used are set out in note 9.
Investments The Group has stated trade investments at fair value.
Further details of these investments and the valuation basis are detailed in note 11 and note 20.

2010 2009 000 000 Recognized deferred tax liabilities Investment held for sale 757 Tax losses 681 76 The deferred tax liability on the investment held for sale and the associated tax losses as at 30 April 2009 have been reversed due to the revaluation of the investment in Frontier Silicon to a fair value of nil 2009: 3,605,000.
The 757,000 deferred tax liability has been credited to changes in fair value of available for sale investments in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

During the period the Group tested its balance of goodwill for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets.
The test was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value in use, using projected cash flows for the Technology business.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the Directors have projected cashflows a five year forecast period is used which is based on management forecasts of future profits, with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2014 of 2.5% per annum 2009: 2.5%.
The terminal growth rate is assessed taking into account general economic conditions.
Forecast revenue growth the revenue projections are consistent with those used by the Group for financial planning purposes.
Forecast operating margins the operating margin projections are consistent with those used by the Group for financial planning purposes.
Discount rate future cash flows are discounted at a rate of 15% which represents a pre tax rate that reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the Technology business 2009: 15%.
The Directors do not believe that any reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value.
Toumaz Holdings the Groups holding in FutureWaves, valued at 489,000 as at 30 April 2009, was exchanged during the year for 6,979,612 shares in Toumaz Holdings, a company listed on AIM.
During the year, a trade receivable valued at 1,687,000 as at 30 April 2009, was also exchanged for 28,153,153 shares in Toumaz Holdings.
The Groups holding was valued at 2,591,000 2009: 489,000 by reference to the quoted share price of Toumaz Holdings at the reporting date.
A gain on conversion of 495,000 has been recognised as a credit in the Income Statement and a reduction in value of 80,000 has been recognised as a change in fair value of available for sale investments in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
66 Frontier Silicon the holding was valued by means of a discounted cashflow forecast based on a five year profit forecast, an annual terminal growth rate after 2015 of 2.5% 2009: 2.5% and using a discount rate of 15% 2009: 15%.
Due to the lower resulting valuation of the business and the impact of Frontiers capital structure, the Groups investment has been revalued to nil 2009: 3,605,000.
A net charge of 613,000 has been recognised as an expense in the Income Statement: the gross impairment charge of 3,605,000 has been offset by 2,992,000 transferred from the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
GreenPlug in consideration for licences and services provided by the Group to GreenPlug, a private US company, the Group received a convertible loan note in GreenPlug.
The Group subsequently exchanged this loan note for a shareholding in GreenPlug.
This holding has been valued by reference to a GreenPlug funding round in January 2010 which valued the Groups holding at 1,959,000.

20 Financial Instruments Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
Categories of financial instruments Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognized in respect of each class of financial assets, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.
2010 2009 Notes 000 000 Financial assets Loans and receivables Trade and other receivables 13 7,289 9,979 Loans 13 795 795 Cash and cash equivalents 14 29,367 14,574 Available for sale investments 11 4,550 4,094 Total financial assets 42,001 29,442 2010 2009 Notes 000 000 Financial liabilities Bank loan 16 431 488 Trade and other payables 15 3,832 4,741 Total financial liabilities 4,263 5,229 70 Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimizing the return on risk.
a Foreign currency risk The Group transacts licence and development agreements with customers and purchases of products for PURE Digital primarily in US dollars and, therefore, the Groups earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a regular basis and, if there is a material exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and the Board considers it appropriate, the Group will reduce the risk by currency hedging on net receivable payable balances.
Forward contracts will be entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with currency receipt.
During the period and as at 30 April 2010 and 30 April 2009 there were no outstanding currency contracts.
The most important foreign currency to the Group is the US Dollar.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group transacts a large proportion of its revenues and costs in US Dollars.
Taking all income and expenditure in US Dollars into account, management have appraised that for the financial year to 30 April 2010, each additional one cent increase or decrease in the US Dollar exchange rate against Sterling would have decreased or increased revenues by circa 314,000 2009: 257,000 and profit by circa 21,000 2009: 30,000. b Interest rate risk The Groups earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates available on bank deposits.
The Group aims to maximize returns from funds held on deposit and uses market deposits with major clearing banks accordingly.
With the current level of bank deposits, the impact of a change in interest rates is not considered material.
In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their average effective interest rate at the reporting date and the periods in which they mature or, if earlier, reprice.
The fixed rate cash deposits were placed with banks throughout the year and earned interest of between 0.1% and 0.6%.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on LIBID equivalents.
Short term receivables and payables are not interest bearing with the exception of the short term element of the long term loan.
The long term loan, which is repayable over 9 years, incurred interest at a rate of 2.5%.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis In the financial year to 30 April 2010, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit would have been increased by circa 256,000 2009: 108,000.
Similarly, if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit would have been decreased by circa 45,000 2009: 76,000. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment of liquid funds.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counter parties that have a high credit rating.
Capital Risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issued new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from the previous financial year.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 16, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the parent, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 17.
The CFO regularly monitors the capital risk on behalf of the board.
Trade Receivables The exposure to credit risk is mitigated by selling to a diverse range of customers.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers prior to sales taking place.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk either by customer or by geography.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
72 Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2010 2010 2009 2009 Ageing of trade receivables: 000 000 000 000 Not past due 6,040 7,658 Past due 0-90 days 844 1,608 Past due greater than 90 days 90 50 339 50 6,974 50 9,605 50 Trade receivables that are less than three months overdue are generally not considered impaired.
Receivables more than three months overdue are considered on a line by line basis and a provision is made where recovery is considered doubtful.
No other financial assets are past due.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
To minimize this risk the Group only invests funds in liquid securities.
As a contingency, the Group maintains a 5 million overdraft facility.
The following table is drawn up based on undiscounted contractual maturities including both interest and principal cashflows.
Carrying Contractual Less than More amount Cashflows 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years than 5 years April 2010 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loan 431 475 69 69 206 131 Trade and other payables 3,832 3,832 3,832 4,263 4,307 3,901 69 206 131 Carrying Contractual Less than More amount Cashflows 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years than 5 years April 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loan 488 543 69 69 206 199 Trade and other payables 4,741 4,741 4,741 5,229 5,284 4,810 69 206 199 73 Fair values of financial instruments Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between two informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
2010 2009 Carrying amount Carrying amount and fair value and fair value Notes 000 000 Financial assets: Trade and other receivables 13 7,289 9,979 Cash and cash equivalents 14 29,367 14,574 Available for sale investments 11 4,550 4,094 Other receivables: Loan note 13 795 795 Financial liabilities: Long term borrowings 16 431 488 Trade and other payables 15 3,832 4,741 Assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above: Cash and cash equivalents The fair value approximates to book value due to the short term maturity of these instruments.
Available for sale investments Fair Value Hierarchy The Group measures the fair value of available for sale investments using the following hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement: Level 1: Quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical financial instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, such as market prices for similar financial instruments.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using unobservable inputs which can have a significant effect on the instruments valuation.
The Group has applied the above hierarchy to its investments as follows: Toumaz Holdings - the valuation is based on the quoted share price for Toumaz Holdings on AIM.
This investment is categorised as Level 1.
Frontier Silicon the valuation is based a discounted cashflow with assumptions made on the forecast cashflows, the annual terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
This investment is categorised as Level 3.
GreenPlug the valuation is based on funding round in January 2010 which is estimated to approximate to the fair value as at the reporting date.
The following table analyses investments, measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised: 2010 2009 000 000 Level 1 2,591 489 Level 2 Level 3 1,959 3,605 4,550 4,094 74 The following table shows a reconciliation from opening balances to the closing balances for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: 000 As at 30 April 2009 3,605 Investment in the year 1,593 Total gains and losses: In income statement 347 In other comprehensive income 2,892 As at 30 April 2010 1,959 Although the Group believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.
With respect to fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the valuation of Frontier Silicon would not be impacted by making reasonable changes to the assumptions on the forecast cashflows, the annual terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
The valuation of the GreenPlug is based on a funding round carried out in January 2010 and in the short intervening period the value is not viewed to be materially different.
Any change in the valuation of GreenPlug would have a commensurate change in the value of the Groups holding.
Loan Note The Loan Note in Frontier Silicon is non-interest bearing.
The time period for redemption of the Loan Note is subject to the discretion of Frontier Silicon, Loan Note holders or a sale or listing and therefore is undetermined.
Fair value is therefore assessed to approximate to book value.
Long term borrowings The fair value approximates to book value as this instrument is at a variable interest rate.
21 Contingent Liabilities The Group had no contingent liabilities at 30 April 2010 or 30 April 2009.
22 Employee Benefits Pension The Group participates in a number of defined contribution pension plans in the UK.
The assets of the schemes are held separately in independently administered funds.
There were no outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date.
75 The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options are as follows: Weighted average Number Weighted average Number exercise price of options exercise price of options 2010 2010 2009 2009 Outstanding at the beginning of the period 70p 12,620,969 68p 18,141,993 Exercised during the period 81p 6,015,291 48p 910,207 Granted during the period 139p 658,209 55.6p 1,698,505 Lapsed during the period 133p 163,142 65p 6,309,322 Outstanding at the end of the period 65p 7,100,745 70p 12,620,969 Exercisable at the end of the period 54p 3,889,388 49p 6,631,252 The weighted average share price during the period was 195.4p 2009: 65.5p.
The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of 19p to 212p and a weighted average contractual life of 3.0 years.
The Company has share option schemes and an employee share plan scheme, details of which are contained in the Remuneration Report.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for share options and employee share plan awards granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of share options and employee share plan awards granted.
In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to share option grants made prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 April 2005.
The estimate of the fair value of the services is measured based on the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo Simulation models, financial models used to calculate the fair value of options and awards under the employee share plan.
76 The assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of options are set out below: Date of share option grant Dec 2002 May 2003 Nov 2003 May 2004 Jun 2004 Jan 2005 Dec 2005 Share price at grant date pence 19 34.5 60 83 82 64.25 67.5 Exercise price pence 24-28 43-52 75-90 104-124 102-123 80-96 84-101 Expected volatility 60% 60% 60% 60% 60% 60% 60% Risk free interest rate 4.4% 3.9% 4.9% 5.1% 5.2% 4.4% 4.4% Time to maturity years 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 Fair value per option pence 9.4 17.0 30.2 42.0 41.5 31.8 34.4 Date of share option grant Jun 2006 Sep 2006 Sep 2007 Sep 2008 Oct 2009 Share price at grant date pence 55 88 113 69.5 210 Exercise price pence 69-82 Expected volatility 60% 60% 41% 46% 63% Risk free interest rate 4.5% 4.5% 5.8% 4.4% 1.7% Time to maturity years 5 3 3 3 3 Fair value per option pence 28.0 34.7 44.5 31.2 118 The assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of the employee share plan awards are set out below: Date of employee share plan grant Sep 2006 Jul 2007 Aug 2007 Jan 2008 Oct 2008 Share price at grant date pence 70.75 128.5 127.5 119 48 Expected volatility 60% 41% 41% 41% 49% Risk free interest rate 4.5% 5.8% 5.8% 5.8% 3.4% Time to maturity years 3 3 3 3 3 Fair value per option pence 53.0 78.4 77.6 72.6 34.2 Date of employee share plan grant Oct 2009 Dec 2009 Apr 2010 Share price at grant date pence 208 228 226 Expected volatility 63% 59% 63% Risk free interest rate 1.7% 2.2% 1.7% Time to maturity years 3 3 3 Fair value per option pence 156.3 145.0 182.0 The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
The following amendments to standards have been adopted in these financial statements for the first time: The amendment to FRS 8 Related Parties Disclosures mandatory for periods beginning on after 6 April 2008.
The amendment has the effect that only wholly-owned subsidiaries are exempt from disclosure of intra-group transactions and there is no longer a disclosure exemption available in parent companys own financial statements.
The amendment to FRS 20 IFRS 2 Vesting conditions and cancellations mandatory for periods starting on after 1 January 2009.
The amendment clarifies the definition of vesting conditions, introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions, requires non-vesting conditions to be reflected in grant-date fair value and amends the accounting for cancellations and settlements by parties other then the entity.
The amendment to FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date mandatory for periods starting on after 1 January 2009 to confirm no obligation exists at the balance sheet date for dividends declared after that date.
The above amendments have had no impact on the financial statements in the current or previous year.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards and under the historical accounting rules.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the period and preceding year in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will continue in operational existence for the forseeable future.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that it is included in the consolidated accounts which it has prepared.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with its subsidiaries.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Details of the Companys subsidiary undertakings are included in note 11 of the Group financial statements.
Share based payment The fair value of options granted is recognized as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value is measured based on an option pricing model taking in to account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date and settlement date with any changes to fair value being recognized in the profit and loss account.
As the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, in accordance with UITF 44, it recognizes an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment 79 charge recognized in its subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognized directly in equity.
Transactions of the Companys Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Companys financial statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Related Parties The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries see note 11 and with its Board of Directors see the Remuneration Report pages 43 to 48.
Details of Remuneration of Key Management Personnel are disclosed in note 23.
