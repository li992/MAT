It has been audited where indicated as such.
An ordinary resolution to approve the report will be put to the AGM on 28 July 2010.
Consideration of Matters Relating to Directors Remuneration The Remuneration Committee sits under the chairmanship of Mr Dicks as the Senior Independent Director with two independent Directors, Mr Moule and Mr Montagu who have served on the Committee throughout the year.
The Committee considers and makes recommendations on the remuneration of the non-executive Directors.
The Company has no employees other than the non-executive Directors.
The Committee engaged Trust Associates Limited to carry out an independent review of the remuneration paid to the Directors and make recommendations.
Trust Associates Limited was also engaged to carry out an independent review of the Boards effectiveness.
The Committee met on 21 April 2010 to consider the level of Directors fees and consider the recommendations from Trust Associates.
Statement of the Companys Policy on Directors Remuneration The Board consists entirely of non-executive Directors, who meet regularly throughout the year to deal with the Companys affairs.
The total fees payable to all the Directors is limited by the Articles of Association to 200,000 per annum.
The principles of the Companys remuneration policy have been, and will continue to be for the forthcoming financial year, that fees payable to Directors should: reect the time spent by them individually and collectively as part of the Board on the Companys affairs: be of a level appropriate to the responsibilities borne by the Directors: be in line with market practice and sufficient to enable candidates of high calibre to be recruited and retained.
The policy also recognises: that the form of remuneration be in cash, payable monthly in arrears, to the Director personally or to a third party specified by him: and the rates are reviewed annually: such review will not necessarily result in any change to the rates.
As the Company is an investment trust and all the Directors are non-executive, it is considered inappropriate to have any long-term incentive schemes and the fees are not specically related to the Directors performance, either individually or collectively.
Remuneration Arrangements for 2009 2010 In the year under review the Directors fees were paid at the following annual rates, the Chairman 30,000 2009: 30,000 : other Directors 20,000 2009: 20,000.
Mr Ashford-Russell waived his fee for 2009 2010 and has indicated that he will do so for the forthcoming year.
Remuneration Arrangements for 2010 2012 The last increase in Directors fees was in 2006 and the Committee commissioned an external review of the Directors remuneration to ensure that it remains competitive with market rates and reects the responsibilities of the Directors.
The Committee considered the recommendations from the independent review and has decided to implement those recommendations as follows: An increase in Directors fees from 20,000 to 23,000 over two equal steps of 1,500 with effect from 1 May 2010 and 1 May 2011.
An increase in the fees paid to the Chairman of the Board from 30,000 to 35,000 over two equal steps of 2,500 with effect from 1 May 2010 and 1 May 2011.
