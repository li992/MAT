Financial Statements Financial Statements 89 Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders, and to minimise its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issues of new shares and buyback of existing shares, and through its loan facility.
For capital management purposes, the Group monitors the ratio of its net debt plus dened benefit pension deficit net of deferred tax to EBITDA.
This policy is unchanged from the prior year.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet plus net debt.
The Groups banking facilities include a number of financial and non-financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored and as at 31 March 2010 and since, none of the covenants had been breached.
