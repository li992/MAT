Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The consolidated financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 9 March 2011.
The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJ Norris and FA Conophy.
Computacenter plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly traded.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2010 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Computacenter plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using existing GAAP in each country of operation.
Adjustments are made on consolidation translating any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profit and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the Group no longer retains control.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year.
Except as noted below, adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group.
They did however give rise to additional disclosures.
The other pronouncements which came into force during the year were not relevant to the Group: IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations IFRS 3 Revised introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations.
It requires that all acquisition related costs are expensed in the period incurred rather than included in the cost of the investment, that changes to the contingent consideration following a business combination are shown in the statement of comprehensive income instead of adjusting goodwill and that changes to deferred tax assets relating to business combinations are only reflected within goodwill if they occur within the measurement period.
The Group has applied IFRS 3 Revised with effect from 1 January 2010.
During the period the Group recognised the benefit of tax losses of 1.7 million attributable to an acquisition completed in a previous period.
The impact is included within current income tax expense.
Had the standard not been adopted, an adjustment to goodwill would have been required.
IAS 27 amended Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements The amended standard requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners and these transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost and any retained interest is remeasured to fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss.
52 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Improvements to IFRS In May 2009 the IASB issued its second omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
The adoption of the amendments did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
New standards and interpretations not yet effective During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which are expected to have implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group or which may require additional disclosures in future financial years.
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Amendment effective 1 January 2011 The amended standard clarified the definition of a related party to simplify the identification of such relationships and to eliminate inconsistencies in its application.
The revised standard introduces a partial exemption of disclosure requirements for government related entities.
The Group does not expect any impact on its financial position or performance.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement effective 1 January 2013 IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the IASBs work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets as defined in IAS 39.
In subsequent phases, the IASB will address classification and measurement of financial liabilities, hedge accounting and derecognition.
The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Groups financial assets.
The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture.
Improvements to IFRS issued in May 2010 The Group expects no impact from the adoption of the amendments on its financial position or performance.
The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB IFRIC standards and interpretations.
As the group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU endorsement mechanism.
In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the groups discretion to early adopt standards.
Critical judgments and estimates The preparation of the Groups financial statements requires management to make judgments on how to apply the Groups accounting policies and make estimates about the future.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgments and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
The more significant judgments and estimates, where a risk exists that a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year could occur, relate to: revenue recognition where, on a limited number of support and managed services contracts, an estimate of the total contract costs is required to determine the stage of completion: estimation of residual value of assets owned to support certain contracts: impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, which is based upon estimates of future cash flows and discount rates for the relevant cash-generating units: recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward, which are dependent upon estimates of future profitability of certain Group companies: and other estimated tax positions, where the decisions of tax authorities are uncertain.
Further information is provided within this note summarising significant accounting policies, and notes 9 and 14 to the financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold buildings 2550 years Short leasehold improvements shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Fixtures and fittings Head office 515 years Other shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Office machinery, computer hardware 215 years Motor vehicles 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 53 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Leases Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets Software and software licences Software and software licences include computer software that is not integral to a related item of hardware.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.
Currently software is amortised over four years.
The carrying values of software and software licences are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Software under development Costs that are incurred and that can be specifically attributed to the development phase of management information systems for internal use are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, once the asset becomes available for use.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business are carried initially at fair value.
Following initial recognition intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives with charges included in administrative expenses as follows: Existing customer contracts 5 years Existing customer relationships 10 years Tools and technology 7 years The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill Business combinations on or after 1 January 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 Revised using the purchase method.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
Goodwill recognised on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, is recorded at its amortised cost at transition to IFRS and is no longer amortised.
Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 remains set off directly against reserves even if the related investment becomes impaired or the business is disposed of.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where an asset does not have independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is assessed for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or cashgenerating unit.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognised at their fair value which initially equates to the consideration given plus directly attributable transaction costs associated with the investment.
54 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
Costs include those incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 3090 day terms, are recognised and carried at their original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Receivables subject to factoring arrangement Some of the Groups trade receivables are subject to factoring arrangements.
These transactions do not meet IAS 39s requirements for derecognition, since the risks and rewards have not been substantially transferred.
All receivables sold through factoring transactions which do not meet the IAS 39 derecognition criteria continue to be recognised in full in the Group financial statements even though they are legally subject to the factoring arrangement: a corresponding liability is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as Factor Financing.
Gains and losses relating to the sale of such assets are not recognised until the assets are derecognised.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing borrowings All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is fide-recognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is fide-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Forward contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward contracts are taken directly to the income statement.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Foreign currency translation The Groups presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the overseas subsidiaries are Euro, US dollar US$ and South African rand ZAR.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Taxation Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses, can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to the statement of comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
VAT Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of VAT except: where the VAT incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT included.
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
56 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts and rebates given to customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Product Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of goods.
Professional Services Revenue is recognised when receivable under a contract following delivery of a service or in line with the stage of work completed.
The stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract and unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If the total estimated costs and revenues of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
A provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
Support and Managed Services Contracted service revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis.
Usually revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis, when this is representative of the stage of completion of an individual contract.
Unrecognised contracted revenue is included as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Amounts invoiced relating to more than one period are deferred and recognised over their relevant life.
On a limited number of Support and Managed Service contracts recognising revenue on a straight-line basis is not representative of the stage of completion.
On these contracts, the stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract and unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Where a contract contains several elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately where appropriate.
Finance income Income is recognised as interest accrues.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Operating leases Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined contribution scheme available to all UK employees.
Contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
There are no material pension schemes within the Groups overseas operations.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions Employees including Executive Directors of the Group can receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 27.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions as none of the conditions set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
As the schemes do not include any market-related performance conditions, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share see note 10.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction from equity see note 26.
Own shares held Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
58 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 3 Segmental analysis For management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical segments, with each segment determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
The Groups business in each geography is managed separately and held in separate statutory entities.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the below reportable operating segments.
Management monitor the operating results of its geographical segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted operating profit or loss which is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.
At a Group level, however, management measure performance on adjusted profit before tax.
Adjusted operating profit or loss takes account of the interest paid on customer-specific financing CSF which management consider to be a cost of sale for management reporting purposes.
Excluded from adjusted operating profit is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional items and the transfer of internal ERP implementation costs as management do not consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of a segment.
Segmental performance for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 2009 was as follows: UK Germany France Benelux Total 000 000 000 000 000 For the year ended 31 December 2010 Results Revenue 1,265,431 1,005,812 359,611 45,641 2,676,495 Adjusted gross profit 189,614 131,511 37,815 4,753 363,693 Adjusted net operating expenses 146,277 111,014 36,825 5,150 299,266 Adjusted segment operating profit loss 43,337 20,497 990 397 64,427 Adjusted net interest 1,626 Adjusted profit before tax 66,053 Other segment information Capital expenditure: Property, plant and equipment 10,552 5,967 491 108 17,118 Intangible fixed assets 11,935 701 138 12,774 Depreciation 21,142 9,971 491 118 31,722 Amortisation 4,073 2,339 138 6,550 Share-based payments 1,918 489 213 2,620 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 3 Segmental analysis continued UK Germany France Benelux Total 000 000 000 000 000 For the year ended 31 December 2009 Results Revenue 1,226,917 930,673 319,384 26,224 2,503,198 Adjusted gross profit 181,149 124,395 37,448 2,838 345,830 Adjusted net operating expenses 143,310 104,831 40,169 3,597 291,907 Adjusted segment operating profit loss 37,839 19,564 2,721 759 53,923 Adjusted net interest 302 Adjusted profit before tax 54,225 Other segment information Capital expenditure: Property, plant and equipment 11,042 8,107 783 118 20,050 Intangible fixed assets 11,891 15,301 71 27,263 Depreciation 24,015 10,064 1,118 129 35,326 Amortisation 3,302 1,209 120 4,631 Share-based payments 1,893 357 305 2,555 Reconciliation of adjusted results Management review adjusted measures of performance as shown in the tables above.

The reconciliation for adjusted operating profit to operating profit, as disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement, is as follows: UK Germany France Benelux Total 000 000 000 000 000 For the year ended 31 December 2010 Adjusted segment operating profit loss 43,337 20,497 990 397 64,427 Add back interest on CSF 1,442 678 2,120 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 519 136 655 ERP implementation costs 4,250 4,250 Segment operating profit loss 40,010 25,289 990 397 65,892 For the year ended 31 December 2009 Adjusted segment operating profit loss 37,839 19,564 2,721 759 53,923 Add back interest on CSF 2,921 1,051 3,972 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 481 36 517 Exceptional items 3,155 291 1,613 240 5,299 ERP implementation costs 2,728 2,728 Segment operating profit loss 34,396 23,016 4,334 999 52,079 Sources of revenue Each geographical segment principally consists of a single entity with shared assets, liabilities and capital expenditure.
The Group has three sources of revenue, which are aggregated and shown in the table below.
The sale of goods is recorded within product revenues and the rendering of services is split into Professional and Support and Managed Services.
Revenue performance is reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker excluding the UK Trade Distribution business, which was disposed of on 27 November 2009.
The table below reflects revenue performance before and after the impact of the sold business.

For the purposes of this disclosure a single customer is considered to be a group of entities known to be under common control.
This customer consists of entities under control of the UK Government, and includes the Groups revenues with central government, local government and certain government controlled banking institutions.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 4 Group operating profit This is stated after charging: 2010 2009 000 000 Auditors remuneration: Audit of the financial statements 400 416 Other fees to auditors local statutory audits for subsidiaries 31 27 other services in pursuant of legislation 12 12 taxation services 68 146 other services 46 98 557 699 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 31,722 35,326 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 815 23 Profit on disposal of business, net of goodwill 1,879 Amortisation of intangible assets 6,550 4,631 Net foreign currency differences 35 897 Costs of inventories recognised as an expense 1,696,592 1,588,654 Operating lease payments minimum lease payments 37,343 40,174 In addition to the auditors remuneration disclosed above, further costs 139,000 incurred in 2009 in relation to non-audit services in respect of the acquisition of becom Informationssysteme GmbH were capitalised at 31 December 2009.
5 Exceptional items 2010 2009 000 000 Operating profit Profit on disposal of business, net of goodwill 1,879 Restructuring costs 7,178 5,299 Income tax Tax on exceptional items included in operating profit 1,415 The profit on disposal of business of 1,879,000 arose from the Group disposing of its Trade Distribution division to Ingram Micro in November 2009.
The disposal did not match the criteria of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations as the disposal did not represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and hence was not treated as a discontinued operation.
The Group received consideration of 2,982,000 in cash and cash equivalents, net of costs incurred in relation to the sale.
This was offset by the disposal of goodwill associated with the business of 1,002,000.
The directly attributable goodwill associated with the Trade Distribution business originally arose from the acquisition of Metrologie UK in 1999.
Separately, related inventories of 8,574,000 were sold to Ingram Micro at cost.
Restructuring costs arose in 2009 from the change programme to reduce costs.
They included expenses from headcount reductions of 5,309,000 and vacant premises costs of 1,869,000.

Of these losses, 99.4 million 2009: 111.1 million arise in Germany, albeit a significant proportion have been generated in statutory entities that no longer have significant levels of trade.
The remaining unrecognised tax losses relate to other loss-making overseas subsidiaries.

e Impact of rate change The Finance No 2 Act 2010 reduced the main rate of UK Corporation Tax from 28 per cent to 27 per cent with effect from 1 April 2011.
The impact of the new rate is to reduce the UK deferred tax asset by 0.2 million.
Additional changes to the main rate of UK Corporation Tax to reduce the rate by 1 per cent per annum to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014 have been proposed.
These changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of these proposals would be to reduce the UK net deferred tax asset by 0.2 million.
10 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per share EPS amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding own shares held.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding own shares held adjusted for the effect of dilutive options.
Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS are presented to provide more comparable and representative information.
Accordingly the adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS figures exclude amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items.

As a consequence, directly attributable goodwill of 1,002,000 was disposed of, and included within the exceptional profit on disposal of business note 5.
This goodwill arose from the acquisition of Metrologie UK in 1999.
Additions to goodwill in 2009 arose from the purchase of becom in Germany on 26 November 2009 and Thesaurus in the UK on 27 November 2009.
The acquired assets and liabilities of becom were fully integrated within Computacenter Germany during the first half of 2010.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is tested for impairment against the Computacenter Germany cash-generating unit.
The acquired assets and liabilities of Thesaurus were immediately integrated within Computacenter UK Limited, consequently the goodwill arising on the acquisition is tested for impairment against the Computacenter UK Limited cash-generating unit.
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations The recoverable amounts of all three cash-generating units have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
To calculate this, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period and on long-term market growth rates of 2.5 per cent 2009: 2.5 per cent thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for all cash-generating units for 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 are: budgeted revenue, which is based on long-run market growth forecasts: budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends: and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 12.0 per cent 2009: 12.0 per cent.
Each cash-generating unit generates value substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to each of them.
Management therefore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
No impairment provision on goodwill has been required at either 31 December 2010 or at 31 December 2009.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer relationships and tools and technology.
The expected useful lives are shown in note 2.

The costs of acquisition amounted to 258,000. becom is based in Germany and is a leading IT infrastructure services provider.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The 2009 consolidated financial statements include the results of becom for the one month period from the acquisition date.

The provisional and final fair values include adjustments to the book values to recognise additional accruals for further expected tax liabilities and to reflect the value of the customer relationships acquired with the business.
At acquisition becom held various intercompany balances with other companies within the Group of which it was a member.
As part of the fair value calculations the Group has made provision against these receivables where it does not expect to recover the amounts due.
Deferred tax assets arise from the temporary differences on the other fair value adjustments.
Included in the 12,140,000 of goodwill that arose on acquisition are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies and an assembled workforce.

If the acquisitions of becom and Thesaurus had taken place at the beginning of 2009, Group revenues for the year ended 31 December 2009 would have been 2,596,314,000 and profit after tax would have been 27,528,000.

Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
Due to strong cash generation over the past three years, the Group is now in a position where it can finance its requirements from its cash balance.
As a result, the Group has not renewed a number of overdraft and factoring facilities during 2010, and consequently the uncommitted overdraft and factoring facilities available to the Group has reduced to 15.5 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 100.3 million.

France Factor finance expired during the year and has not been renewed.
UK Factor financing is in respect of trade debts factored with recourse which represents a proportion of the debts.
Under the terms of the arrangement certain trade debts are sold to the factor who in turn advances cash payments in relation to these debts.
A non-utilisation fees is payable at 0.25 per cent of the available facility where the amounts drawn down equate to less than 50 per cent of said facility.
In the event of a default in payment of a debtor the Group is obliged to support losses to the extent of cash advanced against that debt.
In normal circumstances this will be recovered from the cash pool of debts in which they hold an interest.
The Group is obliged to repay any advance of cash in excess of the maximum amount available for draw-down as calculated under the terms of the agreement.
e Facilities At 31 December 2010, the Group had available 15.5 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities 2009: 100.3 million of uncommitted overdraft and factoring facilities.
The Group also had access to a 60.0 million 2009: 60.0 million committed facility of which 43.5 million 2009: 42.9 million is not utilised as at the balance sheet date.
This facility is due to expire in May 2011.
22 Obligations under leases a Finance lease commitments The Group has finance leases for various items of plant and machinery: these leases have no terms of renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses.

The provisions in relation to the UK properties are discounted at a rate based upon the Bank of England base rate.
Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based on Euribor.
24 Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Finance Directors Review on pages 18 to 21. Credit risk The Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer credit limits.
The credit limits are set for each customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity.
These limits are initially determined when the customer account is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter.
The balance of trade receivables relates to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The maximum exposure on trade receivables, as at the reporting date, is their carrying value.
In France, credit risk is mitigated through a credit insurance policy which applies to non-Government customers and provides insurance for approximately 50 per cent of the relevant credit risk exposure.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, invoice factoring in the UK and finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts.
The Groups bank borrowings, other facilities and deposits are at floating rates.
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into.
When long-term borrowings are utilised, the Groups policy is to maintain these borrowings at fixed rates to limit the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Fair values The carrying value of the Groups short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
The fair value of all other financial instruments carried within the Groups financial statements is not materially different from their carrying amount.
76 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 24 Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
Effect Change on profit in basis before tax points 000 2010 Sterling 25 236 Euro 25 38 2009 Sterling 25 97 Euro 25 52 The impact of a reasonably possible decrease to the same range shown in the table would result in an opposite impact on the profit before tax of the same magnitude.
Forward currency contracts At 31 December 2010 the Group held 148 foreign exchange contracts 2009: 61 as hedges of an inter-company loan and future expected payments to suppliers.
The exchange contracts are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The terms of these contracts are detailed below: 31 December 2010 Buy Sell Value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Euros Sterling 1,100,000 Feb 11 1.1628 Dollars Sterling $12,623,564 JanMar 11 1.55721.6189 Germany Dollars Euros $75,468,000 JanAug 11 1.2281.417 Euros Dollars 5,724,727 JanApr 11 1.2791.319 31 December 2009 Buy Sell Value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Euros Sterling 2,630,000 Mar 10 1.1208 Sterling Dollars $5,632,000 JanFeb 10 1.5841.615 Sterling SA rand R400,500 Jan 10 11.9438 Dollars Sterling $2,537,000 JanFeb 10 1.5941.668 SA rand Sterling R801,000 Jan 10 11.95811.978 Germany Dollars Euros $39,906,000 JanApr 10 1.4351.508 Euros Dollars $2,695,000 JanFeb 10 1.4601.487 Exchange rate sensitivity The majority of the transactions in each of the Groups geographical segments are denominated in the functional currency of that segment.
There are, however, a limited number of transactions where foreign currency exchange risk exists.
In these instances the Group enters into forward currency contracts, as shown in the above table, in order to mitigate such risk.
At the end of the year the fair value of the outstanding contracts was an asset of 562,000 2009: 726,000.
Other than differences arising from the translation of results of operations outside of the Groups functional currency, reasonably foreseeable movements in the exchange rates of 10 per cent or -10 per cent would not have a material impact on the Groups profit before tax or equity.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 24 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 December based on contractual undiscounted payments: On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2010 Financial liabilities 20,498 5,157 13,033 10,884 49,572 Property provisions 2,688 9,348 1,972 14,008 Trade and other payables 440,790 440,790 20,498 445,947 15,721 20,232 1,972 504,370 On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2009 Financial liabilities 18,608 11,605 37,399 23,027 90,639 Property provisions 312 1,844 9,345 2,847 14,348 Trade and other payables 378,929 378,929 18,608 390,846 39,243 32,372 2,847 483,916 Fair value measurements recognised in the consolidated balance sheet Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 December 2010 the Group had forward currency contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of an asset of 562,000 31 December 2009: 726,000.
The realised losses from forward currency contracts in the period to 31 December 2010 of 164,000 2009: gain of 1,370,000, are offset by broadly equivalent realised gains on the related underlying transactions.
25 Capital management Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
Consistent with the Groups aim to maximise return to shareholders, the dividend policy is to maintain a dividend cover of between 22.5 times.
In 2010 the cover was 2.5 times, on a pre-exceptional basis 2009: 2.5 times.
The Groups capital base is primarily utilised to finance its fixed assets and working capital requirements.
The Group intends to optimise the use of working capital and improve its cash flow.
As a consequence, the UK exited the Trade Distribution business in 2009, and has sourced an increasing proportion of its product business via distributors in order to reduce the working capital requirements of the business.
Capital is allocated across the Group in order to minimise the Groups exposure to exchange rates.
Each country finances its own operations, typically resulting in borrowings in France with cash on deposit in the UK and Germany.
During 2010, we introduced a cash pooling arrangement, which group companies can access and allows the Group to pool its funds without physical money movements.
In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are financed by leases, which are secured only on the assets that they finance, or loans.
Whilst the outstanding amounts of this customer-specific financing are included within net funds for statutory reporting purposes, the Group excludes this customer-specific financing when managing the net funds of the business as this outstanding financing is matched by committed future revenues.
These financing facilities, which are committed, are thus outside of the normal working capital requirements of the Groups product resale and services activities.
78 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 25 Capital management continued The measures of net funds that the Group monitors are: 2010 2009 000 000 Net funds excluding customer-specific financing 139,439 86,403 Customer-specific loans 3,532 6,488 Customer-specific finance leases 24,894 42,567 Net funds 111,013 37,348 The net funds excluding customer-specific financing improved in the year from 86.4 million to 139.4 million by the end of the year.
The Group has a history of strong cash generation, however the rise in net funds in 2010 was unusual, given the increase in product revenues, due to a number of factors.
Firstly, following the exit from the CCD business in the UK in late 2009, the UK increased the mix of its purchases via distributors, resulting in lower stock holdings.
Secondly, the Group continued to benefit from the extension of a temporary improvement in credit terms with a significant vendor, equivalent to 38 million at 31 December 2010, an increase of approximately 8 million over the course of the year.
Each operating country manages working capital in line with Group policies.
The key components of working capital, i. e. trade receivables, inventory and trade payables, are managed in accordance with an agreed number of days targeted in the budget process, in order to ensure efficient capital usage.
An important element of the process of managing capital efficiently is to ensure that each operating country rewards behaviour at an Account Manager and Account Director level to minimise working capital, at a transactional level.
This is achieved by increasing commission payments for early payment by customers and reduced commission payments for late payment by customers, which encourages appropriate behaviour.
The Group regularly reviews the adequacy of its facilities against any foreseeable peak borrowing requirement and, as a result of the strong cash position, has allowed certain bank and factoring facilities to expire during 2010.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had available 15.5 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities 2009: 100.3 million of uncommitted overdraft and factoring facilities.
The Group also still has access to a 60.0 million 2009: 60.0 million three year committed facility established in May 2008, of which 43.5 million 2009: 42.9 million is not utilised at the balance sheet date.

There are two primary differences to this presentation compared to the statutory cash flow statement, as follows: 1 Factor financing is not included within the statutory definition of cash and cash equivalents, but operationally is managed within the total net funds borrowings of the businesses: and 2 Items relating to customer-specific financing are adjusted for as follows: a.
Interest paid on customer-specific financing is reclassified from interest paid to adjusted operating profit: and b.
Where customer-specific assets are financed by finance leases and the liabilities are matched by future amounts receivable under customer operating lease rentals, the depreciation of leased assets and the repayment of the capital element of finance leases are offset within net working capital: and c. Where assets are financed by loans and the liabilities are matched by amounts receivable under customer operating lease rentals, the movement on loans within financing activities is offset within working capital.
