The expense recognised in these accounts for the year is 0.1m 2009: 0.1m being the contributions paid and payable.
Defined benefit: The Company participates in a scheme which is part of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2009 and was updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 3 July 2010 and 27 June 2009.
The contributions paid to the scheme are paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 13.3% and 11.2% of pensionable salaries paid to upper and lower tier sections respectively.
The defined benefit scheme is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future, as a percentage of payroll.
