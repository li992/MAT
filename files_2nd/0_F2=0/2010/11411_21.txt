com 53 53 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information Ocado Group plc hereafter the Company is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is Titan Court, 3 Bishops Square, Hatfield Business Park, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL109NE.
The financial information comprises the results of Ocado Group plc and its subsidiaries hereafter the Group, see Note 28.
The financial period represents the 52weeks ending 28 November 2010 prior period 52weeks ending 29 November 2009.
2 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation and development of Ocado Group plc The Company was incorporated on 8 December 2009 and on 9 February 2010 acquired the entire share capital of Ocado Limited.
As a result of this transaction, the ultimate shareholders in Ocado Limited received shares in the Company in direct proportion to their original shareholdings in Ocado Limited.
Under IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations, the acquisition of Ocado Limited by the Company has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition and the consolidated IFRS financial information of the Company is therefore a continuation of the financial information of Ocado Limited.
As a result any financial information after 9 February 2010 represents consolidated financial information of the Group.
Prior to this date the historical financial information represents the financial information of the Companys only operating subsidiary, Ocado Limited see Note 28.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand 000 unless otherwise stated.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments that have been measured at fair value through profit and loss.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Use of assumptions and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Please see Note 3 for further details.

b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all subsidiaries.
The financial year ends of all entities in the Group are coterminous.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control over the operating and financial decisions is obtained and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly, or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
On 9 February 2010, the Group, previously headed by Ocado Limited, underwent a re-organisation by virtue of which Ocado Limiteds shareholders in their entirety exchanged their shares for shares in Ocado Group plc, a newly formed company, which then became the ultimate parent company of the Group.
Notwithstanding the change in the legal parent of the Group, this transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition and the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the new legal parent having been acquired by the existing Group.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including recognised gains arising from inter-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same manner as recognised gains except to the extent that they provide evidence of impairment.
c Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Sterling is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured.
Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within finance income or finance costs.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within Operating loss.
Group companies The results and financial position of all the group entities none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: a assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: b income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates unless average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions : and Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement c all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity.
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by the Company to all periods presented in the financial statements.

com 55 55 2 Accounting policies continued d Revenue Revenue consists of income generated from online sales through the Webshop and includes charges for delivery.
Online sales are shown net of returns, relevant marketing vouchers offers and value added taxes.
Relevant vouchers offers include: money-off coupons, conditional spend vouchers and offers such as buy three for the price of two.
Revenue is recognised at the point when the significant risks and rewards of products have been passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured: in general this is deemed to occur when customers take delivery of the goods.
Income from Ocado Delivery Pass, the discounted pre-pay delivery scheme, is recognised in the period to which it relates on an accruals basis.
e Cost of sales Cost of sales represents the cost to the Group of the product sold.
It consists of all external costs incurred in procuring goods for resale and delivering them to the Customer Fulfilment Centre as well any adjustments to inventories.
f Distribution costs Distribution costs consist of all the costs incurred, excluding product costs, to the point of sale, usually the customers home.
This includes the payroll-related expenses for the picking, dispatch and delivery of product sold to the point of sale, the cost of making those deliveries, including fuel, tolls, maintenance of vehicles, the operating costs of the properties required for thepicking, dispatch and onward delivery operations and all associated depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges.
g Administrative expenses Administrative expenses consist of all advertising and marketing expenditure, the payroll-related expenses of all marketing, IT and other head office functions, costs of annual software maintenance contracts, property-related costs for the head office, all fees for professional services and depreciation, amortisation and impairment of IT equipment and fixtures and fittings.
h Exceptional item IPO costs IPO costs allocated to profit and loss represent the portion of directly attributable costs relating to the secondary shares traded on Admission and other costs attributable to the Listing.
i Other income Other income consists of advertising revenue, commission income received and income from other services to suppliers.
j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment excluding land are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and any costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the cost of the relevant assets less their estimated residual values by equal annual amounts over their expected useful economic lives.
Residual values and expected useful economic lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Depreciation on other fixed assets is found within distribution expenses and is calculated based on the useful economic life indicated below: Freehold buildings and leasehold properties 25 years, or the lease term if shorter Fixtures and fittings 510 years Plant and machinery 320 years 97% between 5 and 10 years Motor vehicles 25 years Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated until it is available for use.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the assets carrying amount and are recognised within operating Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement profit.
k Intangible assets Computer software Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
Externally acquired computer software and software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of three to five years.
Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the development phase recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised in equal annual amounts over the estimated useful life of the software.
Amortisation and impairment of computer software or licences is charged to administration expenses in the period in which it arises.

Assets that are subject to an annual amortisation or depreciation charge are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Given the Groups current operating structure the lowest level at which cash flows can reasonably be assessed is for the Group as a whole.
The Group is still investing in its future growth and so has not yet reached a stage where it delivers positive post tax earnings.
The Group prepares detailed forward projections which are constantly updated and refined.
Based on these projections the Board does not consider that any further impairment of assets is required.
m Borrowing costs Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised.
They are defined as the borrowing costs that would have been avoided if the expenditure on the qualifying asset had not been made.
All other borrowing costs are charged to finance costs, using the effective interest rate method.
n Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.
Finance leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised either as property, plant and equipment, or intangible assets, as appropriate, and are depreciated amortised over their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter.
The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges.
Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement on an effective interest rate basis.
Operating leases Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement on a straight line basis.
Lease incentives Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free periods.
Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term.
o Inventories Inventories comprise goods held for resale, fuel and other consumable goods made up principally of spares.
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Goods held for resale and consumables are initially valued on a current cost basis and adjustments are made at the financial period end to bring this to an average cost basis.
Fuel stocks are valued at calculated average cost.
Costs include all direct expenditure and other appropriate attributable costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
p Taxation The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current taxation Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
com 57 57 2 Accounting policies continued Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity.
q Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Insurance claims Provisions for insurance claims relate to motor insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported and are based on estimates provided to Ocado by the third-party manager of the Ocado Cell in Atlas Insurance PCC Ltd. Dilapidations Provisions for dilapidations are recognised on a lease by lease basis and are based on the Groups best estimate of the likely committed outflow to the Group.
Where material, these estimated outflows are discounted to net present value.
r Employee benefits Pensions The Group contributes to the personal pension plans of its staff through a defined contribution personal pension scheme which is administered by Standard Life.
Employer contributions to the scheme are calculated as a percentage of salary based on length of scheme membership.
Contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments Employees including Directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the years in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The vesting period is 3 years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant or the employee leaves the Group, the options expire subject to a limited number of exceptions.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which both the vesting period has expired and the number of awards, in the opinion of the Directors of the Group based on the best available estimate at that date, that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement satisfied.
The Group has exposure in respect of cash-settled share-based payment transactions and share-based payment transactions with cash alternatives as defined by IFRS 2 Share-based Payments only in respect of bad leaver provisions in the JSOS.
For details of the share options see Note 24. s Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Management consider that the Groups investments fall within this category as explained below.
Investments: Investments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale.
There are currently no investments classified as held for trading.
Available-for-sale investments are held at fair value if this can be reliably measured.
If the equity instruments are not quoted in an active market and their fair value cannot be reliably measured the available-for-sale investment is carried at cost, less accumulated impairment.
Unless the valuation falls below its original cost, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available-for-sale assets are recognised directly in equity.
On disposal the cumulative net gain or loss is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairments and valuations below costs are recognised in the income statement.
Dividends are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables, Short-term investment and Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Trade and other receivables: Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Short-term investment Short-term investment comprises treasury deposits with a maturity of greater than three months at balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management.
They are therefore included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Interest-bearing borrowings Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
On the balance sheet, interest bearing borrowings have been subcategorised as borrowings and obligations under finance leases.
Compound instruments Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible loan stock that can be converted to convertible preference shares at the option of the holder.
com 59 59 2 Accounting policies continued The liability component of the compound financial instrument is recognised on the date of inception or modification at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option.
The equity element is recognised as the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component.
Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the equity and liability components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequently, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group has designated all outstanding derivative financial instrument balances at 28 November 2010 as cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast transactions.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and at the financial reporting period, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of the various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 22.
Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders equity are shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a current asset when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Cash flow hedging The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of property, plant and equipment the gains or losses previously deferred in equity are included in the initial cost of the asset and are ultimately recognised in profit or loss through the depreciation line.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
t Impairment of financial assets Assets carried at amortised cost The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired at the end of each reporting period.
A financial asset is impaired and an impairment loss recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of a loss event that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss includes but is not limited to: Financial difficulty indicators: Breach of contract such as missed payments: Fraud: Bankruptcy: and Disappearance of an active market.
Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The assets carrying value is reduced and the loss recognised in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Available-for-sale financial assets Equity investments classified as available-for-sale and held at cost are reviewed annually to identify if an impairment loss has occurred.
The amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity investments are not reversed.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are addressed below: a Intangible assets capitalised software Cost capitalisation Amounts capitalised include the total cost of any external products or services and labour costs directly attributable to development.
Management judgement is involved in determining the appropriate internal costs to capitalise and the amounts involved.
Useful life The useful life is determined by management at the time the software is acquired and brought into use and is regularly reviewed for appropriateness.
For computer software licences, the useful life represents managements view of the expected period over which the Group will receive benefits from the software, but not exceeding the licence term.
For unique software products controlled and developed by the Group, the life is based on historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their useful economic life, such as changes in technology.
b Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment represents a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group being 33% in 2010 2009:66% of the Groups total assets.
Therefore, the estimates and assumptions made to determine their carrying value and related depreciation are critical to the Groups financial position and performance.
Estimation of useful life The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an assets expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
Increasing an assets expected life or its residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the income statement.
The useful lives of the Groups assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at least annually for appropriateness.
The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.
c Going concern basis including its effect on the impairment of assets The Group has cash reserves and maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term debt finance that is designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its planned expansion.
The Group monitors cash flow as part of its day to day control procedures and management consider cash flow projections on a monthly basis ensuring that appropriate facilities are available to be drawn upon as necessary.
The Group also prepares detailed forward projections for future periods which are constantly updated and refined.
As a consequence, the Directors are satisfied that the Group is able to maintain sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Impairment of assets based on the separation of the business into cash generating units The Group is required to undergo an assessment of the future viability of assets grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Given the Groups current operating structure, the lowest level at which cash flows can reasonably be assessed is for the Group as a whole.
Based on the future projections referred to above, the Board do not consider that any further impairment of assets is required.
There are a large number of assumptions and estimates involved in calculating these future projections, including managements expectations of: Increase in gross sales: Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement Growth in EBITDA: Timing and quantum of future capital expenditure: and The estimation of future funding and the cost of such funding.
com 61 61 3 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued d Leases The Group has a number of complex high value lease arrangements.
The Group follows the guidance of IAS 17 Leases to determine the classification of leases as operating leases versus finance leases.
The classification of a lease as a finance lease as opposed to an operating lease will change EBITDA as the charge made by the lessor will pass through finance charges and depreciation will be charged on the capitalised asset.
Retained earnings may also be temporarily affected depending on the relative size of the amounts apportioned to capital repayments and depreciation.
IAS 17 Leases requires the Group to consider property leases split into their component parts i. e. land and building elements separately.
As only the buildings elements could be considered as a finance lease management must make a judgement, based on advice from suitable experts, as to the relative value of the land and buildings.
e Recognition of deferred tax assets The Groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items.
The final outcome of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the prudent forecasting of future taxable profits of the business and in applying an appropriate risk adjustment factor.
At the balance sheet date management has forecast that the Group would generate future taxable profits against which existing tax losses could be relieved.
As a result the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of 7.3 million with respect to available tax losses.
4 Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Directors.
The principal activity of the Group is the retailing and distribution of grocery and consumer goods within the UK.
The results from the licensing of intellectual property for use outside of the UK to a non-UK subsidiary and the establishment in October 2010 of a captive insurance cell in Malta see Note 28 are not currently separately reported as they are not considered material and management do not believe information about these segments would be useful to the users of the financial statements.
The principal activity of the Group is managed as one segment and does not split its activities into any further regional or product subdivisions in its internal management reporting, as any such split would not provide the Groups management with any meaningful information.
Consequently all activities relate to this one segment.

This stake was acquired in June 2001 at a cost of 395,000.
Payment for the shares was partly in cash 237,000 and partly in equity 1,975 convertible preference shares.
The Groups 25% interest in Paneltex Limited has not been treated as an associated undertaking as the Group do not have significant influence over Paneltex Limited.
In arriving at this decision the Board has reviewed the conditions set out in IAS 28 Investments in Associates and concluded that despite the size of its holding it is unable to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of Paneltex Limited due to the position of the majority shareholder as Executive Managing Director, the insignificant size and arms length nature of the relationship between the Group and the company.
The shares of Paneltex Limited are not quoted in an active market and their fair value cannot be reliably measured.
As such the investment in Paneltex Limited is measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
The Group does not intend to dispose of this investment in the foreseeable future.
If the Group did intend to dispose of this investment then Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement the anticipated exit route would be the sale of shares to the existing shareholder or another connected party of Paneltex Limited.
Further details of the relationship with Paneltex Limited are included in Note 31.

Warrant agreements In 2004, the Group issued to Ranelagh Nominees an affiliate of Lloyds Bank plc and to Lloyds TSB Bank plc warrants to subscribe for up to 5,611,200 ordinary shares at 1.80 per share.
Lloyds TSB Bank plc subsequently transferred its warrants to Ranelagh Nominees Limited.
The warrants provided Ranelagh Nominees with the opportunity to benefit in the equity upside of the Company.
On IPO the warrants were fair valued at 150,000, down 933,000 from that previously recognised.
This decrease in fair value was due to the market price being lower on the IPO than the expected market price per the initial valuation.

The convertible preference shares ranked pari passu with ordinary shares, with the exception that on return of assets on a liquidation, reduction of capital or otherwise, the holders of the convertible preference shares shall be entitled in respect of their preference shares in proportion to the number of such shares held by each of them in priority to all other shareholders, to the surplus assets of the Company remaining after payment of its liabilities, the subscription price for their preference shares together with a sum equal to any arrears of dividends declared calculated down to the date of the return of assets.
On 9 February 2010 the Company acquired the entire share capital of Ocado Limited.
As a result of this transaction, the shareholders in Ocado Limited received shares in the Company in direct proportion to their original shareholdings in Ocado Limited.
Shareholders were issued 100 shares in the Company for every 1 share in Ocado Limited.
The shares in the Company have a nominal value of 2 pence each.
Therefore as at 28 November 2010 share capital represents that of the Company.
The prior period presented represents that of Ocado Limited.
Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement On 26 July 2010 the Companys shares were admitted to the Premium Listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange the Listing.
In conjunction, the Company made an initial public offering IPO of 118,968,225 new 2pence ordinary shares at a price of 180 pence per share.
Also in conjunction, 247,474,900 convertible preference shares converted to ordinary shares.

Costs expensed in the amount of 3.5 million in relation to the IPO relate primarily to legal and professional fees.
The ordinary shares held by the trustee of the Groups employee benefit trust pursuant to the JSOS are treated as treasury shares in the Groups consolidated balance sheet in accordance with IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation.
These ordinary shares have voting rights but these have been waived by the trustee.
The number of allotted, called up and fully paid shares, excluding treasury shares, at the end of each period differs from that used in the loss per share calculation in Note 27 as loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury shares.

The consideration paid is deducted from total shareholders equity and classified as treasury shares on consolidation.
b Scheme of arrangement and capital reduction On 9 February 2010, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement, all of Ocado Limiteds ordinary and convertible preference shares were cancelled.
Immediately thereafter, Ocado Limited issued 100 ordinary shares to the Company for 1 and in consideration of that and of the cancellation of Ocado Limiteds ordinary and convertible preference shares, the Company issued 185,715,900 ordinary shares and 247,474,900 convertible preference shares on the basis of 100 ordinary and or convertible preference shares for each Ocado Limited ordinary share and or convertible preference share held.
The effect of the scheme of arrangement was to replicate the shareholders register of Ocado Limited at the Company level.
On 16 February 2010, pursuant to an order of the Court confirming the reduction of capital of the Company, the Companys share capital was reduced by decreasing the nominal value of each ordinary and convertible preference share issued pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement from 110 pence to 2 pence.
This created distributable reserves of 467.8 million.
c Reverse acquisition reserve The acquisition by the Company of the entire issued share capital of Ocado Limited has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition under IFRS 3 revised.
Consequently the previously recognised book values and assets and liabilities have been retained and the consolidated financial information for the period to 28 November 2010 has been presented as if the Company had always been the parent company of the Group.
The share capital for the period covered by these consolidated financial statements and the comparative periods is stated at the nominal value Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement of the shares issued pursuant to the above share arrangement.
Any differences between the nominal value of these shares and previously reported nominal values of shares and applicable share premium issued by Ocado Limited have been transferred to the reverse acquisition reserve.
com 77 77 23 Share capital and reserves continued d Other reserves Other reserves consist of the foreign currency translation reserve, the fair value reserve and the convertible loan interest reserve.
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the Companys foreign subsidiary, Ocado Information Technology Limited, which is incorporated in Ireland and whose functional currency is Euro.
The fair value reserve comprises gains and losses on the spot movement of the Groups cash flow hedges.
The convertible loan interest reserve existing on 1 December 2008 arose from the issuing of convertible loan stock in 2004 which in accordance with the principles of IAS32 was bifurcated into its liability and equity components.
In March 2009 on the expiry of the stock holders convertible loan stock, 1.1 million previously recognised in the convertible loan interest reserve in respect of this convertible loan stock was transferred to the accumulated deficit reserve.
24 Share options and other equity instruments The Group currently operates three employee share incentive schemes, namely the ESOS, the JSOS and the Sharesave Scheme.
a ESOS The Groups ESOS is an equity-settled share option scheme approved by HMRC.
Options may also be granted under the terms of a schedule, which is not so approved.
The ESOS was established by Ocado in 2001.
Under the ESOS, Ocado or the trustees of an employee trust may grant options over shares in the Company to eligible employees.
The eligible employees to whom options are granted and the terms of such options will be determined by the Directors of Ocado or the trustees.
The employees who are eligible to participate in the ESOS are all Ocados Executive Directors and all employees, including the employees of Ocados subsidiaries.
The exercise price of options may not be less than the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
If the trustees or the Directors have determined that the exercise of an option will be satisfied by the issue of ordinary shares, the exercise price may also not be less than the nominal value of ordinary shares.
The directors of Ocado or trustees may impose a performance target and any further condition determined to be appropriate on the exercise of an option.
Any performance target must generally be measured over a period of at least three years.
There are currently no options granted which are subject to performance targets that have not yet been met.
The vesting period for the ESOS is three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant or the employee leaves the Company, the options expire subject to a limited number of exceptions.
On 9February 2010 the ordinary shares and convertible preference shares in Ocado Limited were converted into ordinary shares and convertible preference shares in Ocado Group plc on a 1:100 basis with a nominal value of 2 pence per share.
Current period opening balance, movements during the period and options outstanding at the end of the period have been disclosed as if the conversion occurred at the beginning of the period.

The Share Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue has confirmed in correspondence that in respect of options granted the exercise price per share was not less than the market value of the Companys shares at each option grant date.
Since the Companys Admission, the closing mid-market price of the shares on the day prior to issuance will be used for all future share option grants.
In determining the fair value of the share options, the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model was used with the following inputs: 28 November 29 November 2010 2009 Weighted average share price 1.47 126.60 Weighted average exercise price 1.27 114.78 Expected volatility 0.25 0.50 Weighted expected life 3.00 4.19 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 5.0% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% Expected volatility was determined by comparing the Company to others of a similar size or which operate in similar.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
All share awards are equity settled.
The charge to the income statement is detailed in Note 7.

The scheme was approved by the shareholders by written resolution in January 2010.
The terms of the JSOS have been approved by the Companys Remuneration Committee who oversee the operation of the scheme.
Participants Following consultation with the Companys lawyers, financial advisers and independent executive remuneration consultants and the Board of Directors approval, awards were granted to the Executive Board and a select group of senior management.
In total they acquired interests in 32.5 million ordinary shares with an issue price of 1.50 per share historically the maximum share price recorded for the Companys shares.
Nature of interests Interests will take the form of a restricted interest in ordinary shares in the Company Interest.
An Interest permits a participant to benefit from the increase if any in the value of a number of ordinary shares in the Company Shares over which the Interest is acquired.
In order to acquire an Interest, a participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the trustees of an employee benefit trust under which the participant and the trustee jointly acquire the shares and agree that when the shares are sold the participant has a right to receive a proportion of the sale proceeds in so far as the value of the shares exceeds a threshold amount.
For the initial Interests acquired by the Participants, there are four tranches each with their own threshold or Hurdle Value as follows: Tranche Vesting Hurdle % above date value issue price 1 2011 01 01 2011 1.7250 15% 2 2012 01 01 2012 1.9075 27% 3 2013 01 01 2013 2.0829 39% 4 2014 01 01 2014 2.2813 52% A participant is required to provide up front funding to the employee benefit trust equal to 2% of the issue price on the acquisition of their interests, amounting to 0.03 per share the Entry Price.
When an Interest vests, the trustees will transfer shares to the participant of equal value to the participants Interest or the Shares will be sold and the trustee will account to the participant for the balance i. e. the difference between the sale proceeds less expenses and the Hurdle Value.
Vesting conditions The vesting of the Interests granted to Participants are subject to a time vesting condition with one-quarter of the Interest in the Shares vesting on the first anniversary of their acquisition, one-quarter on the second anniversary, one-quarter on the third anniversary and the final one-quarter on the fourth anniversary.
The fair value of the Interests awarded under the JSOS was determined using the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model.
As per IFRS 2 Share-based Payments, market based vesting conditions and the share price target conditions in the JSOS have been taken in to account in establishing the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Other non-market or performance related conditions were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted, instead these non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
The following inputs were used in the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model: Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement Weighted average share price 1.35 1.35 1.35 1.35 Weighted average exercise price 1.73 1.90 2.08 2.28 Expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 Weighted expected life 0.91 1.91 2.91 3.91 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected volatility was determined by comparing the Company to others of a similar size or which operate in a similar industry.

Under the scheme, members save a fixed amount each month for three years.
At the end of the three year period they are entitled to use these savings to buy shares in Ocado Group plc at a price equal to 85% of the market value of the shares at the launch date.

25 Financial instruments a Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments are measured by using the following fair value hierarchy: Quoted priced unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data that is unobservable inputs level 3 The fair values of short-term deposits, receivables, overdrafts, payables and loans of a maturity of less than one financial period are assumed to approximate to their carrying values but for completeness are included in this analysis.
The derivative asset at the end of the current period relates to forward foreign exchange contracts, the fair value of which was determined with reference to the forward rate to the date of maturity for all outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at period end.
This derivative Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement asset is categorised as level 2.
In the prior period the Group recognised a derivative liability in respect of warrants issued.
The fair value was determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, and it was categorised as level 3.
The Groups only available-for-sale financial asset consists of an unlisted equity investment of which the fair value cannot be reliably determined.
This investment has been categorised as level 3.
There has been no movement in this investment during the period.

Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment The Groups exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment is managed by only opening and maintaining transactional bank accounts and term deposits with banks and financial institutions which carry a Moodys rating of Aa3 P1 for long-term and short-term deposits, and limiting the amounts that can be deposited with any one such bank or financial institution.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables at the period end comprise mainly monies due from suppliers, which is considered of a good credit quality.
The Group provides for doubtful receivables in respect of monies due from suppliers.
Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity, and the Groups effective controls over this area.
The Group has provided for doubtful receivables in respect of consumer sales by reviewing the ageing profile and, based on prior experience, assessing the recoverability of overdue balances.

c Liquidity risk To manage the working capital needs of the business, the Group is reliant on being able to negotiate sufficient financing arrangements.
To achieve this, the Group maintains a mixture of shortand medium-term debt and lease finance arrangements that are designed to ensure it has sufficient available funds to finance its operations.
In addition, during the period the Group maintained a committed standby bank overdraft facility of 5 million 2009: 5 million.
After the period end this overdraft facility was cancelled and replaced with a Group composite account facility with the requirement that the aggregate of favourable cash balances offset adverse cash balances, with a limit of 5 million adverse balance on any one account within the Group.
The Group monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.
For further details see Note 26.
The table below analyses the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the carrying values and undiscounted contractual cash flows.

com 85 85 25 Financial instruments continued d Market risk Currency risk The Group has foreign currency exposure in relation to its trade payables, a portion of its cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign currency trade payables arise principally on purchases of plant and equipment, whilst Euro bank accounts are maintained in order to minimise the Groups exposure to fluctuations in the Euro relating to current and future purchases of plant and equipment.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into in order to hedge future purchases of Euro.
The Groups exposure to currency risk is based on the following amounts: 28 November 29 November 2010 2009 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents Euro 5,318 Trade payables at period end: Euro 1,254 41 US dollar 2 Derivative asset forward foreign exchange contracts Euro 472 7,044 43 The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on its Euro-related financial instruments: 28 November 2010 29 November 2009 Increase Increase Increase Increase decrease decrease decrease decrease in income in equity in income in equity 000 000 000 000 10% appreciation of the Euro 760 1,453 5 10% depreciation of the Euro 734 1,324 5 A strengthening of the Euro, as indicated, against sterling at 28 November 2010 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts detailed above.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its interest bearing borrowings and floating rate cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups interest rate risk policy seeks to minimise finance charges and volatility by structuring the interest rate profile into a diversified portfolio of fixed rate and floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instruments was: 28 November 29 November 2010 2009 000 000 Fixed rate instruments Chairman Chairmans Statement s Statement Financial assets 79,628 7,779 Financial liabilities 62,195 78,715 Variable rate instruments Financial assets 75,011 5,238 Financial liabilities 11,919 41,350 20177-04 22 03 2011 Proof 12 Our Financials Our Financials Getting to Kno Getting to Kno Our Responsibilities w Ocado w Ocado Getting to Kno Getting to Kno Our Performance w Ocado w Ocado Getting to Know Ocado 86 86 Ocado Gr Ocado Group plc oup plc Ann Annual repor ual report and accounts f t and accounts for the 52 w or the 52 weeks to 28 No eeks to 28 Nov vember 2010 ember 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis An increase of 100 basis points 1.0% in interest rates at the balance sheet date will increase equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
100 basis points was deemed an appropriate rate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.
This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.

com 87 87 26 Capital management The Boards objective is to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and sustain future development of the business, providing returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing.
The Boards policy is to keep borrowings within existing facilities and to negotiate and obtain additional resources required to fund the Groups working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.
The Board closely manages its trading capital, which it defines as its net assets plus net debt.
Net debt is calculated as total debt borrowings and finance leases as shown in the balance sheet, less short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.
The Group has performance based loan covenants in place over certain facilities.
Management monitors the performance targets on a period basis considering actual and forecast results and they maintain constant communication withall of the GroupsLenders.
Throughout the year the Group has complied with all covenants imposed by those Lenders.
The main areas of capital management revolve around the management of the components of working capital including monitoring stock turn, age of stock, age of debtors, debtor days, creditor days, balance sheet re-forecasting, period projected loss, weekly cash flow forecasts, and daily cash balances.
Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval from the Board.
There were no major changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the period.
At the balance sheet date the Groups performance in remaining within its borrowing facilities, including standby overdraft facilities, as measured by the headroom available was as follows: 28 November 29 November 2010 2009 Notes 000 000 Total facilities available 191,373 137,775 Facilities drawn down 18 74,114 120,065 Undrawn facilities at end of period 117,259 17,710 Short-term investment 15 30,000 Cash and cash equivalents gross of drawn overdraft facility 16 124,780 13,157 Total undrawn facilities, short-term investment and cash available at the end of the period 272,039 30,867 27 Loss per share Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOS and accounted for as treasury shares, adjusted to reflect the conversion of the ordinary shares and preference shares from Ocado Limited to Ocado Group plc on a 1:100 basis on 9 February 2010.
The loss for the period is equally attributable to the shareholders of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares.
For more information see Note 23.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares, adjusted to reflect the conversion of the ordinary shares and the convertible preference shares from Ocado Limited to Ocado Group plc as mentioned above.
The Company has two categories of potentially dilutive shares, namely share options and shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOS.
There was no difference in the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share as the effect of all potentially dilutive shares outstanding was anti-dilutive.
