Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 89 18.
Deferred tax continued The groups unutilised tax losses and allowances at 31 December 2010 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the future against which the tax losses and allowances can be utilised.
In accordance with paragraph 37 of IAS 12 Income Taxes the group re-assessed its unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2010 with respect to ring fence tax losses and allowances.
Taking into account the considerable increase in oil price in the last quarter of 2010 and the inclusion of additional UK fields in the groups proven and probable reserve profile, the groups corporate oil price assumption was increased from US$70 bbl in 2009 to US$75 bbl in 2010 and the corporate model used to assess whether additional deferred tax assets should be recognised was re-run using this price along with the inclusion of the additional UK fields.
As a result, US$67.4 million of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets have been recognised in 2010.
In addition to the above, there are non-ring fence UK tax losses of approximately US$171.3 million 2009: US$92.1 million and non-UK tax losses of approximately US$10.0 million for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
None of the UK tax losses ring fence and non-ring fence have a fixed expiry date for tax purposes.
A deferred petroleum revenue tax PRT asset has been recognised to the extent that it is probable that the asset will reverse when the PRT field is fully decommissioned.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, following a change in UK tax legislation in 2009 which exempted foreign dividends from the scope of UK corporation tax, where certain conditions are satisfied.

Asset and Equity Plan The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 31.5% Risk free rate of interest: 4.4% Historic market value growth factor: 109.0% For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
The Asset and Equity Plan expired in 2009 and the award granted in 2008, which matured at the end of 2010, is the last award remaining under the plan.
