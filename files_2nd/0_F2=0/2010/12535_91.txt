Share option plans The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the companys shares have been granted to certain executives and employees.
Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will lapse on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2010 had a weighted average exercise price of 8.33 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.0 years.

The company recognised a cost of US$52.7 million and US$27.3 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2010 and 2009 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 31.5% Risk free rate of interest: 4.4% Historic market value growth factor: 109.0% For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
The Asset and Equity Plan expired in 2009 and the award granted in 2008, which matured at the end of 2010, is the last award remaining under the plan.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards, Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan and of the Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 40.0% to 41.0% Risk free rate of interest: 3.3% to 3.7% Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29 to 0.30 For the year ended 31 December 2010, the total cost recognised by the company for long-term incentive arrangements is US$18.0 million 2009: US$26.0 million, with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$nil 2009: US$11.1 million.
A credit of US$52.7 million has been recorded in the profit and loss reserve 2009: US$27.3 million for all equity-settled payments of the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the profit and loss account as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
