Share-based payments As at 31 December 2010 the Group had one active equity-based long term incentive plan, the Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan, for the granting of non-transferable awards to certain employees and executives.
Option awards granted under the plan typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria.
The maximum life of the options is 10 years after grant date.
Options are settled in equity once exercised.
Share awards are granted to certain employees within the Group and are transferred to them on completion of the awards performance criteria.
Outstanding awards at 31 December 2010 and their estimated fair values when granted are set out below: Estimated Awards fair outstanding value at 2010 grant date Awards Long term incentive award 2008 i 389p Long term incentive award 2009 ii 955,512 199p Long term incentive award 2010 ii 797,266 169p Employee share awards iii 400-463p 1,752,778 Notes: i 2008 awards are subject to revenue, operating margin and return on capital conditions ii 2009 and 2010 awards are subject to total shareholder return and return on capital conditions iii Grants were on more than one date The following table shows the number of share awards outstanding during 2010 and 2009: Number of 2010 Share options Shares Awards Outstanding at start of the year 3,233,221 406,964 3,640,185 Exercised awarded during the year 56,779 406,964 463,743 Lapsed during the year 2,220,930 2,220,930 Granted during the year 797,266 797,266 Outstanding at end of year 1,752,778 1,752,778 Exercisable at end of year Number of 2009 Share options Shares Awards Outstanding at start of the year 4,199,905 463,782 4,663,687 Exercised awarded during the year 326,847 18,939 345,786 Forfeited during the year 1,595,349 37,879 1,633,228 Granted during the year 955,512 955,512 Outstanding at end of year 3,233,221 406,964 3,640,185 Exercisable at end of year 56,779 The weighted average exercise price for all awards is nil 2009: nil.
76 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2010 The weighted average share price of share options exercised and shares awarded in 2010 was 353p 2009: 140p.
The estimated fair value of each option granted under the long term incentive award 2008 was calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends based on historical dividend payment, expected life of the option until exercise and a risk-free interest rate based on government securities with a similar maturity pro le.
The estimated fair value of each option granted under the long term incentive awards 2009 and 2010, which are subject to market conditions, were calculated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends based on historical dividend payment, the expected life of the option until exercise, a risk-free interest rate based on government securities with a similar maturity pro le and the volatility and correlation of Total Shareholder Return TSR with a comparator group of companies.
The 2010 award is also subject to TSR comparison relative to the UK Retail Price Index.
The estimated fair value of each share granted to employees is calculated based on the share price at grant date, adjusted for the non-accumulation of dividends.
The model inputs for share option awards that existed as at 31 December 2010 are set out below: Long term Long term Long term incentive incentive incentive award award award 2010 2009 2008 Share price at date of grant p 298 284 430 Exercise price p nil nil nil Expected volatility 62% 58% 46% Expected life years 3 3 3 Risk-free rate 1.3% 2.2% 5.0% Expected dividend yield 5.0% 4.5% 3.0% Expected volatility of comparator group 52% 49% n a Correlation with comparator group 27% 27% n a Retail Price Index 2.5% n a n a Proportion meeting service criteria 100% 100% 100% The weighted average contractual life for the share-based awards outstanding as at 31 December 2010 is 9.2 years 2009: 7.7 years.

Acquisitions Analysis of deferred and contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions Certain acquisitions made by the Group are satis ed in part by deferred or contingent deferred consideration.
The Group has re-estimated the amounts due where necessary, with any corresponding adjustments being made to goodwill.

The initial consideration paid on completion was 0.3m in cash.
Further cash consideration, estimated at 1.0m, is payable in the next two years subject to certain performance requirements.
The initial fair value of net assets acquired amounted to less than 0.1m, resulting in the recognition of 1.3m of goodwill.
OTC Valuations Ltd did not have a material effect on the Groups results for the year.

Contingent liabilities From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation.
Notwithstanding the uncertainties that are inherent in the outcome of such matters, there are no issues which are considered to pose a signi cant risk of material adverse financial impact on the Groups results or net assets.
In the normal course of business, certain Group companies enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover trading arrangements and or the use of third party services or software.

Retirement bene t obligations a fide ned bene t schemes The Group operates two fide ned bene t schemes in the UK which are discussed below, and a small number of schemes in other countries which collectively are not signi cant in the context of the Group.
i The Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme fide ned Bene t Section is a fide ned bene t final salary funded pension scheme.
The Principal Employer of the scheme is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
The fide ned bene t section of the scheme was closed to new members in 1991 and since May 2003 future accrual on a fide ned bene t basis has ceased.
Members in service in 1991 receive bene ts on the better of a money purchase underpin and fide ned bene t basis.
For fide ned bene t section members in service in May 2003 there is a continuing link between bene ts and pensionable pay.
ii The Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme is a fide ned bene t final salary funded pension scheme.
The scheme was closed to new members in 1989 and since April 2006 future accrual on a fide ned bene t basis has ceased.
Members receive bene ts on the better of a money purchase underpin and fide ned bene t basis.
For members in service in April 2006 there is a continuing link between bene ts and pensionable pay.
The assets of the UK schemes are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contract-based policies of insurance.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid into the UK fide ned bene t schemes during 2011 is 1.0m.
The latest funding actuarial valuations of the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme and of the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme together, the UK fide ned bene t schemes were carried out as at 30 April 2010 and 1 January 2010 respectively by independent quali ed actuaries.
The main financial assumptions used by the independent quali ed actuaries of the UK fide ned bene t schemes to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were: 2010 2009 % % Key assumptions used: Discount rate 5.30 5.70 Expected return on schemes assets 6.64 7.05 Expected rate of salary increases 4.95 5.05 Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 3.50 3.60 In ation assumption 3.70 3.80 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997.
The majority of current and future pensions receive xed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
80 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2010 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2010 funding valuations.
For the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme the assumptions are that a member who retires in future at age 60 will live on average for a further 28 years 2009: 29 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 31 years 2009: 31 years after retirement if they are female.
For the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme the equivalent assumptions are 30 years 2009: 30 years for males and 31 years 2009: 31 years for females.
Current pensioners are assumed to have a consistent but generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.
