Costs of the share issue of 4,413,000 have been charged to the share premium account.
The IPO offering represented a trigger event for vesting of the Groups legacy 2005 and 2008 ESOP arrangements.
Consequently, 5,828,944 10 pence ordinary shares have been issued to option holders for total consideration of 8,570,000 during the year.
Further details relating to share options are provided in note 30.
Net proceeds from issue of ordinary shares in the cash flow statement of 34,173,000 represent 25,587,000 from the IPO and 8,586,000 from the exercise of share options.

On a return of assets on liquidation the assets if any remaining, after the debts and liabilities of the Company and the costs of winding up have been paid or allowed for, shall belong to, and be distributed amongst, the holders of all the ordinary shares in proportion to the number of such ordinary shares held by them respectively.
Share based payment Legacy schemes Legacy scheme share based payments in the income statement of 3,841,000 2009: 10,391,000 arise from the Groups 2005 and 2008 ESOP Schemes and share based loan notes, which had been implemented in previous years to incentivise certain employees.
Options in these schemes are exercisable at a price determined by the Board of Directors on the date of grant.
During 2009, the Group offered UK employees the opportunity to exercise options under the 2005 ESOP scheme in advance of the final vesting date, on condition that the post tax proceeds be rolled over as loan notes payable to employees.
Early exercise of some of these options resulted in an additional charge for 2009 of 5,553,000.
Costs in 2009 also include 2,699,000 arising from a modification to the terms of certain options.
The amount payable to employees on loan notes varies only if the market value of the Group falls below an agreed threshold.
Other terms of the loan notes are broadly consistent with the options they replaced.
The loan notes have therefore been accounted for as cash settled share based payments.
The IPO during the year represented a trigger event for the 2005 and 2008 ESOP Schemes.
On the date of the IPO, 50% of the options outstanding vested, with 25% vesting in 2011 and 25% in 2012.
Options lapse if not exercised within 10 years of original grant and may lapse if the employee leaves the Group.
