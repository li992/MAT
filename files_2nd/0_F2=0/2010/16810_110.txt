Financials Fair value hedges The Companys policy is to use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings.
The Company designates these as fair value hedges of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the profit and loss account for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity settled share-based compensation plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Companys equity instruments.
The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based compensation plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the Companys subsidiaries over the vesting period.
The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments.
Dividends paid and received Dividends paid and received are included in the Company financial statements in the period in which the related dividends are actually paid or received or, in respect of the Companys final dividend for the year, approved by shareholders.
Pensions The Company is the sponsoring employer of the Vodafone Group pension scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Vodafone Group pension scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Therefore, the Company has applied the guidance within FRS 17 to account for defined benefit schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and recognise only the contribution payable each year.
The Company had no contributions payable for the years ended 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009.
