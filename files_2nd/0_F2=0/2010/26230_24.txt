These are unlikely to have a material impact on the Group accounts.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments on classification and measurement, issued in November 2009 effective for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
This is the first part of a new standard on classification and measurement of financial assets that will replace IAS 39.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost and fair value.
All equity instruments are measured at fair value.
A debt instrument is at amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest, otherwise it must be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group does not intend to early-adopt this standard.
Amendment to IAS 12, Income Taxes issued in December 2010 expected to come into force for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011.
The amendment provides an exception to the general principles of IAS 12 for investment properties measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 Investment Property, which requires the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the entity expects to recover the carrying amount of an asset.
The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Group accounts.
Amended IAS 24 revised, Related party disclosures, issued in November 2009.
It supersedes IAS 24, Related party disclosures, issued in 2003.
IAS 24 revised is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party and removes the requirement for governmentrelated entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government and other government-related entities.
IFRIC 19, Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments, issued in November 2009 effective for annual periods commencing on or after 1 July 2010.
This IFRIC clarifies the accounting when an entity renegotiates the terms of its debt with the result that the liability is extinguished through the issuing of its own equity instruments to the creditor.
This interpretation is not expected to have any impact on the Group.

Profits or losses arising on the elimination of own debt holdings are also excluded from operating profit.
Changes have been made to the presentation of certain notes to improve transparency.

The composition of the Savings and Investment management segments changed in 2010, with institutional retail investment business now included in Savings investments.
Previously this was reported in the Investment management segment.
Comparative information has been amended to reflect the change.
The Risk segment comprises individual and group protection, individual and bulk purchase annuities, and general insurance, together with estate agencies and the housing related business conducted through our regulated mortgage network.
The Savings segment comprises non profit investment bonds, non profit pensions including SIPPs, ISAs, retail unit trusts, and all with-profits products.
The Investment management segment comprises institutional fund management business.
The International segment comprises businesses in the United States, France, the Netherlands and emerging markets.
Shareholders equity supporting the non profit Risk and Savings businesses is held within Legal & General Assurance Society Limited and Legal & General Pensions Limited and is managed on a groupwide basis within Group capital and financing.
This also includes capital within the Groups treasury function, and unit trust funds and property partnerships, which are managed on behalf of clients but are required to be consolidated under IFRS, which do not constitute a separately reportable segment.
Transactions between reportable segments are on normal commercial terms, and are included within the reported segments.
The Group assesses performance and allocates resources on the basis of supplementary operating profit before tax set out in Note 2.
Segmental IFRS operating profit before tax is reconciled to the consolidated profit from continuing operations before tax attributable to equity holders and consolidated profit from ordinary activities after income tax.
The Group considers additional performance measures in assessing the performance of the segments.
These include new business levels Note 4 and EEV reporting Supplementary Financial Statements.

At half-year 2009, non profit Risk business reflected a small reduction in yield from action taken to sell some of the Groups holdings of tier 1 and upper tier 2 bank securities.
These actions have contributed 75m to the negative investment variance.
The cash and overlay strategy executed on the portfolio resulted in adverse effects on the assumed yields at the half-year which are reflected within IFRS profit.
As expected these half-year yield impacts have been reversed by action taken in further diversifying the credit portfolio in the second half of the year.
The impact of strengthening assumptions for reinvestment of cash flows, variability in currency hedging costs and inflation is also reflected here, in addition to the negative impact from default provisioning of 50m.
Savings investment variances reflect management action taken in the second half of the year to optimise the tax position of unit linked business.

The net equity holders profit from UK long term business has borne tax at the effective equity holders tax rate.
For participating business and certain non profit business this is sufficiently close to the standard rate of UK corporation tax for that tax rate to be used in the financial statements.
For the remaining non profit business, the effective equity holders tax rate is used.
For equity holders funds within Societys LTF, the equity holders income tax is the income tax attributed to the return on those funds.
The balance of income tax associated with UK long term business profits is then classified as income tax attributable to policyholders returns.
The equity holders effective rate of tax for the year of 24.9% 2009: 21.4% is lower than the standard corporation tax rate applicable to companies operating in the UK of 28% 2009: 28%.

Under the PSP, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period is dependent on the Groups relative TSR.
The award will vest in full for upper quintile performance.
One quarter of the award will vest for median performance.
Awards will vest on a straight line prorated basis for performance between the median and upper quintile.
For awards made prior to 2008, the performance condition is based upon the FTSE 100.
For awards made during or after 2008, half of each award will be measured using the existing FTSE 100 test, the remaining half is measured against a bespoke group of UK and European insurance companies.
The group comprises all UK-listed life insurers that are constituents of the FTSE 350, plus all members of the insurance sector of the FTSE Eurotop 300.
The two halves are measured independently, thus it is possible that one half may vest, whilst the other does not.
For both comparator groups, the companies used are members of the relevant indices as at the date of award.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee assesses whether the underlying performance of the Company is reflective of the TSR result.
In exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may exercise their discretion to scale back the vesting of awards, if it is felt that the Companys performance did not justify the level of vesting.
The parameters which the Remuneration Committee use in making this assessment include market share, partnerships gained and maintained, cost constraint, capital management and shareholder perception.
During the year, 12,221,575 performance shares 2009: 14,819,263 were awarded.

Employee share plan ESp Under the ESP, approved by HMRC, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase Group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The Group supplements the number of shares purchased by matching the first 20 of the employees contributions.
From time to time, the Group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
After vesting the shares remain within the Trust until they are transferred to the employee or the employee leaves the Group.
The Trust is consolidated into the results of the Group with the unvested shares disclosed as employee scheme shares.
The fair value of the granted shares is equal to the market value at the grant date.

The remaining risks are outlined in the risk management note see Note 48.
Financial investments include 435m 2009: 714m of debt securities pledged as collateral against derivative liabilities.
The assets used as collateral are Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds, AAA Supranational Bonds, AAA, AA and BBB rated bonds 2009: Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds, AAA Supranational Bonds, AAA, AA and BBB rated bonds having a residual maturity of over 34 years 2009: over 18 years.
The Group is entitled to receive all of the cash flows from the asset during the period when it is pledged as collateral.
Further, there is no obligation to pay or transfer these cash flows to another entity.
The Group can decide to substitute an asset which is designated as collateral at any time, provided the relevant terms and conditions of the International Swap Dealers Association agreement are met.
During 2010, a review of the classification of index linked assets within Legal & General Netherlands was undertaken.
As a result, 0.8bn of assets, reported in 2009 as unit linked, were reclassified to assets which shareholders are directly exposed.
This has also been reflected in Notes 47 and 48.
Financial investments have been allocated between those expected to be settled within 12 months and after 12 months in line with the expected settlement of the backed liabilities.
Assets in excess of the insurance and investment contract liabilities have been classified as expected to be settled after 12 months.

indd 126 25 03 2011 11:27 GROuP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 127 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuEd CdOs The Group holds collateralised debt obligations CDO with a market value of 1,022m at 31 December 2010 2009: 1,212m.
These holdings include 875m 2009: 1,063m relating to four CDOs that were constructed in 2007 and 2008 in accordance with terms specified by Legal & General as part of a strategic review of the assets backing the annuity portfolio.
The Group selected at outset and manages the reference portfolios underlying the CDOs to give exposure to globally diversified portfolios of investment grade corporate bonds.
The Group is able to substitute the constituents of the original reference portfolios with new reference assets, allowing the management of the underlying credit risk although substitutions in 2009 were limited and no substitutions were made in 2010.
A breakdown of the underlying CDO reference portfolio by sector is provided below: At 31.12.10 At 31.12.09 Sector % % Banks 14 14 Utilities 10 10 Consumer Services & Goods 26 26 Financial Services 6 6 Technology & Telecoms 9 9 Insurance 6 6 Industrials 20 20 Oil & Gas 6 6 Health Care 3 3 100 100 The CDOs are termed as super senior since default losses on the reference portfolio have to exceed 28%, on average across the four CDOs, before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Assuming an average recovery rate of 30%, then over 39% of the reference names would have to default before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Beyond 28% of default losses on the reference portfolio, losses to the CDO would occur at a rate that is a multiple of the loss rate on the reference portfolio.
For illustration a 200m loss could be incurred if default losses to the reference portfolios exceeded 31% or if 44% of the names in the diversified global investment grade portfolio defaulted, with an average 30% recovery rate.
All figures are averages across the four CDOs.
Despite the difficult financial conditions in early 2009, the underlying reference portfolio has had no reference entity defaults in 2009 or 2010.
Losses are limited under the terms of the CDOs to assets and collateral invested.
These CDOs also incorporate features under which, in certain circumstances, the Group can choose either to post additional cash collateral or to allow wind up of the structures.
These features are dependant on the portfolios weighted average spreads, default experience to date and time to maturity.
No additional collateral was posted to any of the CDOs in 2010 2009: nil.
During the year the Group received 155m of previously posted collateral, which was the primary reason for the reduction in the CDOs market value.
These CDOs are valued using an external valuation which is based on observable market inputs.
This is then validated against the internal valuation.
For the purposes of valuing the non profit annuity regulatory and IFRS liabilities, the yield on the CDOs is included within the calculation of the yield used to calculate the valuation discount rate for the annuity liabilities.
An allowance for the risks, including default, is also made.
For EEV purposes, the yield on the CDOs, reduced by the realistic default assumption, is similarly included in assumed future investment returns.
The balance of 147m of CDO holdings includes 37m 2009: 41m exposure to an equity tranche of a bespoke CDO.

iii Fair value hierarchy Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflects the Groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The Group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 : fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices.
However, following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have classified them as level 2.
Accordingly, these assets have also been classified in level 2.
Level 3 assets, where internal models are used to represent a small proportion of assets to which shareholders are exposed and reflect unquoted equities including investments in private equity, property vehicles and suspended securities.
In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In these situations, the Group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the Group has classified within level 3.
indd 130 25 03 2011 11:27 GROuP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 131 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuEd The Group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available.
The Group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate.
As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the Groups credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data, as well as the best information about the individual financial instrument.
Illiquid market conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of the Groups financial instruments.
As a result, there is generally no or limited observable market data for these assets and liabilities.
Fair value estimates for financial instruments deemed to be in an illiquid market are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors.
These fair values are estimates and involve considerable uncertainty and variability as a result of the inputs selected and may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be material.
As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realisable in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument.
In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique could significantly affect these fair value estimates.
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker.
These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee.

Derivative liabilities are reported in the balance sheet within Payables and other financial liabilities Note 37.
The notional amounts of some derivative instruments provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet.
However, these amounts do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or price risks.

Forward foreign exchange contracts net investment hedges The Group hedges part of the foreign exchange translation exposure on its net investment in its overseas subsidiaries, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
It recognises the portion of the gain or loss which is determined to be an effective hedge through reserves within shareholders equity, along with the gain or loss on translation of the foreign subsidiaries.
Interest rate swap contracts fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge fixed rate loans in particular to hedge the movement in the fair value of a loan due to interest rates.
Fair value gains and losses arising from fair value hedging relationships are as follows: Fair value gains of 23m arose on hedging instruments 2009: losses of 21m.
Fair value losses of 24m arose on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk 2009: gains of 27m.
The total fair value gain on hedging instruments shown above excludes fair value gains arising from factors which are outside the designated hedging relationship of nil 2009: gain of 5m.
derivative contracts held for trading The Group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures in accordance with the Groups risk management policy, but for various reasons are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship.
Therefore, these contracts must be designated as held for trading, and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the income statement.

No UK tax liability will therefore arise in respect of any remittance of earnings from overseas subsidiaries.
As such, no deferred tax liability is recognised on these profits.
Furthermore, it is expected that no foreign tax will arise on the earnings in the jurisdiction of the foreign entity upon distribution and as such, no deferred tax has been provided in respect of foreign tax.
unrecognised deferred tax assets The Group has the following unrelieved tax losses carried forward as at 31 December 2010.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these tax losses as at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009, as it is probable that there will be no suitable taxable profits emerging in future periods against which to relieve them.
Relief for these tax losses will only be recognised if it becomes probable that suitable taxable profits will arise in future periods.
The potential deferred tax asset unrecognised as at 31 December 2010 is 58m 2009: 32m.

They are disclosed as employee scheme shares until they vest to employees.
Share-based liabilities to employees may also be settled via purchases directly from the market or by the issue of new shares.
The ESOT has waived its voting rights and its rights to some of the dividends payable on the shares it holds.
Employees are entitled to dividends on the shares held on their behalf within the EST and the ESP.

Excludes unearned premium reserve of 134m 2009: 120m for which there are no cash flows.
Insurance contract undiscounted cash flows are based on the expected date of settlement.
Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the Group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly, unit linked liabilities have been excluded from thetable.

Accordingly unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the reported cash flows.
A maturity analysis based on the earliest contractual repayment date would present investment contract liabilities as due on the earliest period of the table because policyholders can exercise cancellation options at their discretion.
In such a scenario, the liability would be reduced due to the application of surrender penalties.

The non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the Groups operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.
Non-participating business For its non-participating business the Group seeks to make prudent assumptions about its future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience.
The approach used to set non-participating assumptions is generally similar to that used to determine the assumptions used for FSA statutory peak 1, although the actual assumptions may sometimes differ from those used for regulatory reporting purposes.
These assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.
Valuation rates of interest and discount rates The valuation interest rate for each contract type is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract adjusted for the risk that asset proceeds are not received by the Group.
For some business, this yield is the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities and the running yield on variable interest securities.
For other business it is the Internal Rate of Return on the portfolio of backing assets.
In 2010 the Group continued to hold reserves to protect against the risk of credit default.
For approved securities and swaps backing both with and non profit business, the allowance remains at 3bps per annum 2009: 3bps.
For unapproved securities backing non profit annuity business, the credit default allowances equate to 1.5bn or 64bps 2009: 1.5bn and 68bps respectively when expressed over the duration of the assets held.
A similar methodology has been used for assets backing with-profits business.
The Group believes the total default allowance is prudent to cover all reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
For equity investments, the yield is based on the current dividend yield, adjusted for prudence.
For property holdings, yields are based on the rental income payable calculated by considering different categories of tenant separately, adjusted for the possibility of default.
Default rates used in the calculations vary by tenant category.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMIB of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
These tables are based on industry-wide experience.
The majority of internal statistical investigations are carried out at least annually to determine the extent to which the Groups experience differs from that of the industry and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.
Persistency The Group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually.
Persistency can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.
The Group tries to balance past experience and future conditions by making prudent assumptions about the future expected long term average persistency levels.
For non-participating contracts where explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.
indd 146 25 03 2011 11:27 grOuP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 147 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuEd Expenses The Group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business.
Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the Groups business plan.
An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made, taking account of both salary and price information.
Participating business For its participating business, the Group seeks to establish its liabilities at their realistic value in line with the requirements set out in FRS27.
Non-economic assumptions are set to represent the Groups best estimates of future experience.
Economic assumptions The FSAs realistic reporting regime requires a market consistent economic model.
The model is calibrated using market data from a variety of market sources.
This enables assumptions to be determined for the term structure of risk free interest rates, property and equity volatility.
Risk free interest rates are determined with reference to the gilt yield curve on the valuation date increased by ten basispoints.
Property volatility is set with reference to historic variations in property prices.
Equity volatility is set so that the model reproduces observed market prices of traded equity derivatives.
Correlations between asset classes are based on historic data.
Each investment scenario contains a consistent set of assumptions for investment returns and inflation.
Future bonuses Future reversionary and terminal bonuses are consistent with the bonus policies set out in Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
Value of in-force non-participating contracts The Group makes a reduction from the liabilities for the expected value of future profits arising on non-participating contracts written in the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The economic assumptions used to calculate the value of these profits are consistent with those used to calculate liabilities for with-profits business, with the addition of a liquidity premium in respect of assets backing non-participating annuity business.
Non-economic assumptions represent best estimates of expected future experience on this business.
Guaranteed annuity options The guarantees are valued on a market consistent basis.
The valuation methodology allows for the correlation between interest rates and the proportion of the policyholders who take up the option.

For product groups where liabilities are positive, the lower interest rate of 2.25% or 2.5 3.5% is used 2009: 2.25% or 2.75 3.75%.
However, for product groups where liabilities are negative, the higher rate of 7.6% 2009: 7.60% is used.
For term assurance with critical illness, morbidity rates are assumed to deteriorate at a rate of 0.5% pa for males and 0.75% pa for females 2009: 0.50% pa for males and 0.75% pa for females.
There is an additive loading of 1% for guaranteed term contracts post policy duration 5 2009: additional loading for guaranteed level term contracts of 0.85% multiplied by policy term less 5 years.
The corresponding loading for guaranteed decreasing term contracts is 0.65% multiplied by policy term less 5 years.
For vested annuities, mortality rates are assumed to reduce according to CMIBs mortality improvement model: CMI 2009 with the following parameters: Males: Long Term Rate of 2% p. a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 120 Females: Long Term Rate of 1.5% p. a. up to age 85 tapering to 0% at 120 2009: CMIB Working Paper 30 projection MC with a minimum of 2.0% pa up to age 90 tapering to a minimum of 0% pa at age 120 for males.
For females, mortality rates are assumed to reduce according to 75% CMIB projection MC with a minimum of 1.5% pa up to age 90 tapering to a minimum of 0% pa at age 120.
For certain annuities, a further allowance is made for the effect of initial selection.
Table created by blending PCXA00 with PNXA00 tables.
The base table to be used for BPA policies in deferment is PNMA00 up to and including age 55 and PCMA00 for age 65 and above for males.
The identical method is applied to females using PNFA00 and PCFA00.
Premiums non-participating business For those contracts where the policyholder does not have the right to vary the amount of the premium paid, full credit is taken for the premiums contractually due at the valuation date.
For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, the provision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
Persistency non-participating business Lapse rates are used in the valuation of certain classes of long term business.
Where this is the case, the valuation persistency basis is set by applying a prudential margin over the best estimate assumptions.
The tables below show the major products where lapse rates have been used.
indd 148 25 03 2011 11:27 grOuP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 149 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINuEd For term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policys lifetime when it is treated as an asset but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policys lifetime when it is treated as a liability.
The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.
Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.
For unitised business, the margin acts to either increase or decrease the best estimate lapse rates, depending upon which approach results in the higher liability.
The direction of the margin is assessed for unit life business and unit pensions business separately.

No drawings were made under these facilities during 2010.
The maturity profile above is calculated on the basis that a facility to refinance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related.
If refinancing under the Groups credit facilities was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassified as repayable between one and five years.

Recent changes announced by the UK Government have changed the rate of inflation relevant to benefits of the UK defined benefit pension schemes in certain circumstances.
The interaction of these changes with the scheme rules has led to a change in the calculation of the defined benefit liability.
The amendments reflect a change of the inflation assumption from RPI to Consumer Price Index CPI inflation for the revaluation of the accrued benefits earned after 2 May 2006 for members who have become early leavers.
This change has reduced the defined benefit liability by 3m and has been reflected as an assumption change.

This valuation technique uses assumptions which are consistent with the Groups effective rate of interest, investment return assumptions and persistency assumptions used in other valuations, but it is not determined by reference to published price quotations.
The undiscounted value which is expected to be paid at maturity in respect of such commission is 248m 2009: 225m.

The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them.
The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the FSA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.
Various Group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time.
The relevant members of the Group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
The provisions made are regularly reviewed.
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.
In 1975, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited the Society was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Office on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of the Society.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to the Society against any liability the Society may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of the Society would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV is now owned by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Whether the Society has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability, is uncertain.
The Society has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions.
Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of Group companies in support of their business activities, including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain Group companies liabilities under the Group pension fund and scheme.

From a regulatory perspective the Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on an ongoing basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which we operate.
At 31 December 2010, Legal & Generals unaudited Insurance Group Directive IGD capital resources were 3.7bn 2009: 3.1bn in excess of capital requirements of 3.0bn 2009: 2.5bn, representing a solvency coverage ratio of 226% 2009: 224%.
This surplus capital is after accruing for a 2010 final dividend of 201m 2009: 160m.
The Group writes a range of long term insurance and investment business in the long term fund LTF of its main operating insurance subsidiary, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited Society.
This fund is segregated from the Groups other assets.
The fund includes participating with-profits business where policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and rewards, and non-participating non profit business, where the shareholders receive profits or incur losses.
Capital in excess of the amount required to cover the liabilities is currently held within Society.
This capital provides support for new and existing non profit business within our UK non profit Risk and Savings businesses.
The non-linked, non profit pensions and annuity business of Society is ceded, on arms length terms, to a wholly owned Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle ISPV, Legal & General Pensions Limited LGPL.
Whilst an ISPV is not required to segregate policyholder assets within a LTF, LGPL continues to manage policyholder and shareholder assets separately for internal purposes.
Managed pension fund business is written through Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited PMC, which is a life company writing predominantly non-participating group pension business effected by trustees of occupational schemes in the UK or their equivalent overseas.
The assets are held in a LTF and are separate from other assets within the Group.
In addition, the Group operates two UK long term insurance businesses acquired in 2008 Nationwide Life Limited and Suffolk Life Annuities Limited.
General insurance business is written in the UK by Legal & General Insurance Limited, and long term insurance business is also written by subsidiaries in America, the Netherlands and France.
Capital management policies and objectives The Group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage.
The Group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.
Capital measures The Group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the Group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business.
The measures used by the Group include: Accounting bases Management use the primary financial statements prepared on an IFRS basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.
In addition, the supplementary accounts prepared using EEV principles provide further insight into the value of the business to shareholders.
Accordingly the Groups net asset value and total capital employed are also analysed and measured on this basis.
Regulatory bases The financial strength of the Groups insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements see below.
One of these regulatory measures, Individual Capital Assessment ICA, measures capital using risk based stochastic techniques, and provides a measure of the level of economic capital required to run the Groups business.
Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements In each country in which the Group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by long term insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities.
The minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the year.
This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.

The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates are detailed below: UK regulatory basis Required capital for the life business is based on FSA rules.
Society must hold assets in excess of the higher of two amounts, the first being calculated using the FSA rules specified by the Regulator pillar 1, the second being an economic capital assessment by the Company which is reviewed by the FSA pillar 2, otherwise known as ICA.
The public pillar 1 capital calculation is calculated by applying fixed percentages to liabilities and sums assured at risk or setting aside a proportion of expenses Peak 1.
There are further stress tests for participating business, as measured in the Realistic Balance Sheet Peak 2, which may increase the required capital under Peak 1 calculations.
The private pillar 2 capital calculation is an assessment of the economic capital required to ensure that the Company can meet its liabilities, with a high likelihood, as they fall due.
This is achieved by application of stochastic modelling and scenario testing.
The result is reviewed and may be modified by the FSA.
Regulatory capital for the general insurance business is also calculated using FSA pillar 1 and pillar 2 requirements.
The pillar 1 calculation applies fixed percentages to premiums and claims.
Pillar 2 creates a higher capital requirement and is therefore applied in this business.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital RBC based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.
French and Dutch regulatory bases The minimum required capital is defined by the French Ministry of Finances Code des Assurances and the fide Nederlandsche Bank N. V. Dutch Supervisory Body respectively.
The basis of the calculation is a percentage of the liabilities plus a percentage of the sum assured at risk and, for some contracts, the premium.
The percentages depend on the guarantees given and the amount of reinsurance cover.
Group regulatory basis In addition to the regulatory capital calculations for the individual firms, the Group is required to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
Available regulatory capital resources Capital resources available to meet regulatory UK capital requirements are determined using FSA valuation rules.
The asset valuation rules are based on UK GAAP, adjusted for admissibility, counterparty exposure limits and specific valuation differences.
The Groups regulatory capital position statement in Table 1 sets out the different sources of capital held within the Group.
The Groups total available capital resources, based on unaudited FSA returns, are 5.9bn 2009: 5.1bn of which 4.5bn 2009: 4.2bn is held by the life businesses.
The use of capital held by the UK and overseas life businesses is generally constrained by local regulatory requirements, and may not be available to provide funding for other businesses.
The total available capital resources of the Groups with-profits business with-profits estate is determined in accordance with the Realistic Balance Sheet rules prescribed by the FSA.
At 31 December 2010, the realistic value of the UK participating liabilities was 15.3bn 2009: 15.3bn under the FSA realistic capital regime.
The excess of realistic assets over realistic liabilities was 1.0bn 2009: 0.8bn.
The capital resources reflect the surplus in that part of the fund which is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
The liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet do not include the amount representing the shareholders share of future bonuses.

Capital resources are also sensitive to assumptions and experience relating to mortality and morbidity and, to a lesser extent, expenses and persistency.
The most significant sensitivities arise from the following four risks: market risk in relation to UK participating business which would crystallise if adverse changes in the value of the assets supporting this business could not be fully reflected in payments to policyholders because of the effect of guarantees and options.
The capital position of this business would also deteriorate if increases to the market cost of derivatives resulted in an increase in the liability for guarantees and options in the realistic balance sheet.
market risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the return from the fixed interest investments supporting this business were lower than that assumed for reserving.
mortality risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the mortality of annuitants improved more rapidly than the assumptions used for reserving.
mortality risk in relation to the UK and US term assurance businesses, which would crystallise if mortality of the lives insured was higher than that assumed, possibly because of an epidemic.
A range of management actions is available to mitigate any adverse impact from changing market conditions and experience, including changes to with-profits bonus rates, changes to discretionary surrender terms and charging for guarantees.
To the extent that management actions are expected only to offset partially adverse experience, then liabilities would be increased to anticipate the future impact of the adverse experience and total capital resources would be reduced.

The four categorisations presented are: unit linked For unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
Unit linked business is written in both the Society LTF and in the LTF of PMC.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders.
The Group is, therefore, not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.
Detailed risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.
With-profits Policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and returns of the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The return to shareholders on virtually all participating products is in the form of a transfer to shareholders equity, which is analogous to a dividend from the Society LTF and is dependent upon the bonuses credited or declared on policies in that year.
The bonuses are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, property and fixed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns.
With-profits also includes participating business in the France operation which shares similar characteristics.
The with-profits classification excludes unit linked contracts.
Non profit non-unit linked Shareholders are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of assets backing non profit non-unit linked business held within UK LTFs.
Shareholder All other assets are classified as shareholder assets.
Shareholders of the Group are directly exposed to market and credit risk on these assets.
This includes the assets and liabilities of our overseas insurance operations.

It covers the overall approach that applies to all risks, and includes a detailed review of risks within the Groups key businesses.
Risk management objectives The Groups primary objective in undertaking risk management activity is to manage risk exposures in line with risk appetite, minimising its exposure to unexpected financial loss and limiting the potential for deviation from anticipated outcomes.
In this respect, a framework of limits and qualitative statements, aligned with the Groups risk appetite, is in place for material exposures.
Risk management approach A significant part of the Groups business involves the acceptance and management of risk.
The Group is exposed to insurance, market, credit, liquidity and operational risks and operates a formal risk management framework to ensure that all significant risks are identified and managed.
The risk factors mentioned below should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.
Insurance risk: exposure to loss arising from claims experience being different to that anticipated.
Market risk: exposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets.
Credit risk: exposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group.
Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
Operational risk: exposure to loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events.
Group risk: the risk of loss that a firm may be exposed to as a consequence of being a member of a group of companies.
Group risk comprises Capital Adequacy Risk and Contagion Risk.
An explanation of the risk framework and the methods used to monitor and assess risk exposures can be found in pages 14 to 17. management of risks The Group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board.
The key control techniques for the major categories of risk exposure are summarised in the following sections.
Insurance risk Insurance risk is implicit in the Groups insurance business and arises as a consequence of the type and volume of business written and the concentration of risk in particular policies or groups of policies subject to the same risks.
A detailed review of the Groups inherent residual risks associated with insurance products is included on pages 186 to 191.
Insurance risk is managed using the following techniques: Policies and delegated authorities for underwriting, pricing and reinsurance The Groups insurance risk policy sets out the overall framework for the management of insurance risk.
As part of the framework, a structure of delegated pricing and underwriting authorities is in place.
Pricing is based on assumptions, such as mortality and persistency, which have regard to past experience and to trends.
Insurance exposures are limited through reinsurance.
Overall, the Group seeks to be conservative in its acceptance of insurance risks by establishing strict underwriting criteria and limits.
The underwriting policy is clearly documented, setting out risks which are unacceptable and the terms applicable for non-standard risks.
Reinsurance is used to reduce potential loss to the Group from individual large risks and catastrophic events.
It may also be used to manage capital or to provide access to specialist underwriting expertise.
The Group makes extensive use of reinsurance for its UK individual protection business, placing a proportion of all risks meeting prescribed criteria.
The principal General insurance reinsurances are excess of loss catastrophe treaties, under which the cost of claims from a weather event, in excess of an agreed retention level, is recovered from insurers.

Policies for each subsidiary are in line with locally established actuarial techniques, relevant regulation and legislation.
Further details of the assumption setting process are included in Note 34.
Market risk The Group exposure to market risk is influenced by one or more external factors, including changes in specified interest rates, financial instrument prices, foreign exchange rates, and indices of prices or rates.
Significant areas where the Group is exposed to these risks are: assets backing insurance and investment contracts other than unit linked contracts: assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies: and other financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups market risk policy sets out the overall framework for the management of market risk.
The policy is reinforced by more granular investment policies for long term and other business, which have due regard to the nature of liabilities and guarantees and other embedded options given to policyholders.
The Group manages market risk using the following methods: Asset liability matching The Group manages its assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant regulatory requirements, reflecting the differing types of liabilities it has in each business.
For business such as immediate annuities, which is sensitive to interest rate risk, analysis of the liabilities is undertaken to create a portfolio of securities, the value of which changes in line with the value of liabilities when interest rates change.
This type of analysis helps protect profits from changing interest rates.
Interest rate risk cannot be completely eliminated, due to the nature of the liabilities and early redemption options contained in the assets.
For businesses where a range of asset types, including equity and property, are held to meet liabilities, the Group uses stochastic models to assess the impact of a range of future return scenarios on investment values and associated liabilities.
This allows the Group to devise an investment and with-profits policyholder bonus strategy which optimises returns to its policyholders over time, whilst limiting the capital requirements associated with these businesses.
The Group uses this method extensively in connection with its UK with-profits business.
Derivatives The Group uses derivatives to reduce market risk.
The most widely used derivatives are exchange-traded equity futures and swaps.
The Group may use futures to facilitate efficient asset allocation.
In addition, derivatives are used to improve asset liability matching and to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation risks.
It is the Groups policy that amounts at risk through derivative transactions are covered by cash or corresponding assets and that swaps are collateralised to reduce counterparty exposure.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is exposed to lower returns or loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets and liabilities arising from changes in underlying interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on the investment portfolio it maintains to meet the obligations and commitments under its non-linked insurance and investment contracts, in that the proceeds from the assets may not be sufficient to meet the Groups obligations to policyholders.
To mitigate the risk that guarantees and commitments are not met, the Group purchases financial instruments, which broadly match the expected non-participating policy benefits payable, by their nature and term.
The composition of the investment portfolio is governed by the nature of the insurance or savings liabilities, the expected rate of return applicable on each class of asset and the capital available to meet the price fluctuations for each asset class, relative to the liabilities they support.
indd 173 25 03 2011 11:29 174 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 gRouP FiNaNcial statemeNts Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts coNtiNued 48 Risk maNagemeNt aNd coNtRol coNtiNued Additionally, fluctuations in interest rates will vary the repayments on variable rate debt issued by the Group Note 35.
Asset liability matching significantly reduces the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
Sensitivity to interest rate changes is included in Table 2 of Note 46 and Tables 6 and 7 of Note 48.
Inflation risk Inflation risk is the potential for loss as a result of relative or absolute changes in inflation rates.
The Group is exposed to inflation risk in two specific areas: Certain non-linked contracts, such as annuities, may provide for future benefits to be paid taking account of changes in the level of inflation.
Contracts in payment may also include an annual adjustment for movements in prices indices, subject to an annual cap.
The Group seeks to manage the risk of movements in price indices through an appropriate investment strategy including the use of inflation swaps: and In writing long term business, the Group makes assumptions regarding the future costs of product servicing.
The assumptions take account of changes in price indices and the costs of employment, with stress testing evaluating the effect of significant deviations on the Groups capital position.
Currency risk The Group is potentially exposed to loss as a result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group manages its currency risk exposure in the following way: In respect of long term business assets and liabilities denominated in non-sterling currencies, the Group protects its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by backing obligations with investments in the same currency and through hedging using derivatives: and Balance sheet foreign exchange currency translation exposure in respect of the Groups international subsidiaries is actively managed in accordance with a policy, agreed by the Group Board, which allows net foreign currency assets to be hedged through the use of derivatives.
As described in Note 47, the Group is not directly exposed to risks on unit linked contracts.

Other price risk Other price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk.
These changes may be as a result of features of the individual instrument, its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market.
The Group controls its exposure to geographic price risks by using internal country credit ratings.
These ratings are based on macroeconomic data and key qualitative indicators.
The latter take into account economic, social and political environments.
Table 3 indicates the Groups exposure to different equity markets around the world.
Unit linked equity investments are excluded from the table as the risk is retained by the policyholder.
A 10% reduction in the value of listed UK equities would result in a reduction in pre-tax profit attributable to shareholders of 71m 2009: 54m.
The impact on the with-profits fund has not been provided as the reduction would be offset by a change in the unallocated divisible surplus.

Significant areas where the Group is exposed to credit risk are: The Group holds corporate bonds to back part of its insurance liabilities.
Significant exposures are managed by the application and regular review of concentration limits, with allowance being made in the actuarial valuation of the insurance liabilities for possible defaults: and The Group limits its exposure to insurance risk by ceding part of the risks it assumes to the reinsurance market.
To limit the risk of reinsurer default the Group operates a credit rating policy when arranging cover.
When selecting new reinsurance partners the Group considers only companies which have a minimum credit rating equivalent to Afrom Standard & Poors.
Exposure limits for new and existing reinsurers are determined based on credit ratings and projected exposure.
Aggregate counterparty exposures are regularly monitored both at an individual subsidiary level and on a Groupwide basis.
The credit profile of the Groups assets exposed to credit risk is shown in Table 4.
The credit rating bands are provided by independent rating agencies.
For unrated assets, the Group maintains internal ratings which are used to manage exposure to these counterparties.
Unit linked assets have not been included as shareholders are not directly exposed to risk.
The carrying amount of non-unit linked assets included in the balance sheet represents the maximum credit exposure.

indd 182 25 03 2011 11:29 gRouP FiNaNcial statemeNts ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 183 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts coNtiNued Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk policy defines the overall framework for the management of liquidity risk.
The Group does not seek exposure to liquidity risk in its own right, but recognises that exposure to liquidity risk can arise as a consequence of the markets in which it operates, the products that it writes and through the execution of investment management strategies.
The liquidity risks to which Legal & Generals insurance businesses may be exposed primarily stem from low probability events that if not adequately planned for may result in unanticipated liquidity requirements.
Such events may include a flu pandemic or natural disaster leading to significantly higher levels of claims than would normally be expected and extreme market conditions impacting the timing of cash flows or the ability to realise investments at a given value within a specified timeframe.
Collateral requirements for derivative futures transactions and other types of financial instrument can also give rise to liquidity risk if sufficient cash or suitable alternative assets are not available to meet collateral calls when due.
At a Group level, liquidity risk may arise in extreme market conditions, should the Group be unable to issue short term debt or commercial paper.
A limited level of contingent liquidity risk is an accepted element of writing contracts of insurance.
However, the Groups insurance businesses seek to maintain sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities to meet a prudent estimate of the cash outflows that may arise from contingent events.
The level of required liquidity to be maintained by insurance funds is identified using techniques including cash flow analysis for ranges of extreme scenarios and stress tests for shock events.
To ensure an appropriate pool of liquid assets are maintained in line with a prudent estimate of cash outflows, the profile of investment assets held to meet future liabilities from writing insurance business are structured to include an appropriate proportion of cash and other readily realisable assets.
The required profile is formally defined as part of asset benchmarks provided to the investment managers, with regular management information provided by the investment manager on the actual holding relative to the fund benchmarks.
The level of insurance funds held in cash and other readily realisable assets at 31 December 2010 was 2.6bn 2009: 2.2bn.
In addition to each insurance fund maintaining a pool of liquid assets, the Groups Treasury function provides formal facilities to the Groups operating subsidiaries to cover contingent liquidity requirements arising from more extreme events and where investment assets may not be readily realisable.
The facility available to each subsidiary is determined through analysis of potential shock events and the potential timing differences that may arise in cash flows.
Specific liquidity risks associated with the Groups core product lines and the risk mitigation techniques are as follows: Annuities: Potential for liquidity risk arises within two specific aspects of the Groups annuity businesses i changes in future pension commitments and ii collateral requirements for risk hedging strategies.
i Changes in future pension commitments Once business has been written, cash outflows for pensions in payment are generally predictable, enabling the Group to structure the liquidity, income and maturity profile of investment assets backing long term liabilities to meet projected cash outflows.
Although variations in longevity can alter the duration of cash outflows over the long term, trends are gradual, providing opportunity to respond with appropriate risk mitigation strategies.
ii Collateral requirements for risk hedging strategies As part of the investment asset management strategy for the Groups UK annuities business, financial instruments are utilised to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, inflation and foreign currency, which may otherwise result in long term liabilities being unmatched.
Financial instruments are also used to mitigate the impact of rating downgrades and defaults within corporate bond portfolios.
The use of such financial instruments can require the posting of liquid collateral with counterparties, and as such an appropriate pool of the assets types specified by counterparties must either be held or readily available.
In this context, the Groups annuity portfolio held eligible assets worth 10 times the outstanding collateral as at 31 December 2010.
Liquidity requirements in excess of the surplus assets would be met by funds held by the Groups Treasury function.
Typically within the overall fund of investment assets held to meet the long term liabilities arising from annuity business, 350m is held in cash and other highly liquid investment types for general liquidity purposes.
Protection: Potential for liquidity risk within the Groups protection businesses may arise should the rate of claims diverge significantly from that anticipated, typically as a consequence of an extreme event.
indd 183 25 03 2011 11:29 184 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 gRouP FiNaNcial statemeNts Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts coNtiNued 48 Risk maNagemeNt aNd coNtRol coNtiNued The risk of being unable to settle claims as they fall due is actively managed with provision being made and cash pools maintained within investment portfolios for a prudent estimate of the potential claims that may arise from in-force business, taking account of extreme events.
Such provisions are validated using stress tests.
The use of reassurance also acts to mitigate liquidity, the effect of the treaties being to limit the Groups liability for the overall sums assured, with a recovery being made from the reinsurance counterparty for that element of the claim covered by the treaty.
Whilst timing differences can arise between the payment of claims and reimbursement by reinsurance counterparties, the Group seeks to ensure that these are accommodated from cash pools and intra-group facilities.
With-profits: Exposure to liquidity risk may arise if the profile of investment assets held to meet obligations to with-profits policyholders is not aligned with the maturity profile of policies, or the profile does not adequately take account of the rights of policyholders to exercise options or guarantees to specified early surrender terms or minimum rates of return.
Liquidity risk associated with with-profits business is managed through the analysis of the maturity profile of the fund taking account of projected future levels of bonus, policyholders reasonable expectations and projected early withdrawals, and ensuring that an appropriate proportion of the fund is held in cash or other readily realisable assets to meet each tranche of maturities and anticipated early withdrawals as they fall due.
Where policyholders have discretion to require early payment of policy proceeds for example by requesting a surrender value, appropriate contractual safeguards are in place to ensure that the fund and remaining policyholders are not disadvantaged should a material number of policyholders exercise this discretion.
Unit linked business: Investment risks associated with unit linked business, including those associated with liquidity, are generally borne by the holders of units in these funds.
Liquidity risk specifically arises for unit holders in that certain asset classes in which the funds invest such as property in certain market conditions may not be readily realisable or only realisable in a specified timeframe at a diminution of value.
Liquidity risks associated with these asset classes are documented and communicated to customers in point of sale product literature.
Product terms & conditions also highlight that for certain product types that include asset classes that may be illiquid, the Group retains the right to defer the processing of fund withdrawal requests for up to six months, should underlying assets need to be realised to meet payment requests.
To minimise the need to invoke these terms, the funds seek to maintain sufficient holdings in cash assets to meet foreseeable withdrawal activity.
The Groups Treasury function manages the Groups banking relationships, capital raising activities, overall cash and liquidity position and the payment of dividends.
The Group seeks to manage its corporate funds and liquidity requirements on a pooled basis and to ensure the Group maintains sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities to meet a prudent estimate of its net cash outflows.
In addition, it ensures that, even under adverse conditions, the Group has access to the funds necessary to cover surrenders, withdrawals and maturing liabilities.
The Group has in place a 960m syndicated borrowing facility, expiring in 2012, which provides flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity.
Operational risk All business managers are required to confirm regularly the adequacy of controls over operational risks to business unit Risk and Compliance Committees RCCs, the Group Executive Risk Committee and the Group Audit Committee.
Significant control issues which business areas identify are escalated to business unit RCCs, which oversee their resolution.
There are a number of categories under which operational risk and its management across the Group can be considered, and these are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Internal process failure The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of loss from failure of the internal processes with which it transacts its business.
Each subsidiary is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the controls over its processes and regular reviews are undertaken of their appropriateness and effectiveness.
People The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of loss from inappropriate actions by its staff.
The risk is actively managed by business management and human resource HR functions.
Recruitment is managed centrally by HR functions, and all new recruits undergo a formal induction programme.
All employees have job descriptions setting out their accountabilities and reporting lines, and are appraised annually in accordance with agreed performance management frameworks.
Employees in regulated subsidiaries are provided with appropriate training to enable them to meet the relevant regulatory requirements.
Risks relating to health and safety and other legislation are managed through the provision of relevant training to all staff.
indd 184 25 03 2011 11:29 gRouP FiNaNcial statemeNts ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 185 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts coNtiNued Outsourcing The Group is potentially exposed to the actions or failure of suppliers contracted to provide services on an outsourced basis.
The required minimum standards of control for outsourced arrangements are set out in the Groups outsourcing and critical supplier policy.
Legal Legal risk is the risk of loss from unclear or deficient product documentation: inadequate documentation in support of material contracts such as reassurance treaties: the incorrect interpretation of changes in legislation: employment related disputes and claims: and commercial disputes with suppliers.
The risks are actively managed through the Group Legal Risk framework, which defines minimum standards of control to be applied to minimise the risk of loss.
Compliance Compliance risk within the Group relates to the risk of non-adherence to legislative requirements, regulations and internal policies and procedures.
Responsibility for ensuring adherence to relevant legal and regulatory requirements is vested in individual business managers.
A Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance function has oversight of the Groups compliance with conduct of business requirements and standards, providing policy advice and guidance and oversight of compliance arrangements and responsibilities.
Event Event risk relates to the potential for loss arising from significant external events such as terrorism, financial crisis, major changes in fiscal systems or disaster.
Typically, such events have a low likelihood of occurrence, a material impact and can be difficult to prevent.
The Groups risk mitigation focuses on minimising the business disruption and potential financial loss which may ensue from such an event.
This includes maintaining a framework for the management of major incidents, the maintenance and regular testing of detailed business, technical and location recovery plans and the provision of insurance cover for the loss of buildings, contents and information technology systems and for the increased cost of working in the event of business disruption.
Fraud The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of internal fraud, claims-related fraud, and external action by third parties.
The risk of internal fraud is managed through a number of processes including the screening of staff at recruitment, segregation of duties and management oversight.
The activities of Internal Audit also act to counter the risk.
Claims-related fraud is managed by ensuring business processes are designed to fully validate claims and ensure that only bona fide claims are settled.
Anti-fraud techniques are regularly updated to mitigate risks and emerging threats.
The Groups approach to mitigating fraud and other dishonest acts is supported by promoting an open and honest culture in all dealings between employees, managers and those parties with which the Group has contact.
A formal code of ethics sets out the Groups expectations in this respect.
Effective and honest communication is essential if malpractice is to be effectively dealt with.
The Group has defined whistle blowing procedures to enable all employees and those who work with Legal & General to raise matters of concern relating to Legal & General in confidence.
Personnel independent of the business reporting line act as designated whistle blowing contacts and include the heads of Internal Audit and Group Compliance.
The Group also operates a hotline facility to report concerns, either in confidence or anonymously.
Technology The Group places a high degree of reliance on IT in its business activities.
The failure of IT systems could potentially expose the Group to significant business disruption and loss.
To mitigate this risk, standards and methodologies for developing, testing and operating IT systems are maintained.
Disaster recovery facilities enable IT operations to be conducted at remote locations in the event of the loss of computer facilities at a principal office site.
All records are remotely backed up and computer suites are equipped with alternative power sources.
Group risk The potential for contagion risk arises as a consequence of: the use of a common brand across the majority of the Group: and the provision of intra-group loans and indemnities.
The Group has defined policies and procedures for managing matters that may have reputational implications, to ensure that Legal & Generals position is correctly understood.
The Group also has defined policies for the provision of guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort.

The Group seeks to manage concentrations by setting limits around the maximum exposure to loss that it can tolerate from a series of related events.
Limits set include maximum exposures to single lives, geographic locations, financial instruments and reinsurance balances.
long term insurance risks UK long term insurance products are structured as either participating or non-participating.
The level of shareholders interest in the value of policies and their share of the related profit or loss varies depending upon the contract structure.
Non-participating contracts Non-participating business is written mainly in the non profit part of the Society Long Term Fund LTF.
Profits accrue solely to shareholders.
In addition, there is some non-participating business in the with-profits part of the Society LTF where the profits are shared, between participating policyholders and shareholders.
Protection business individual and group The Group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits.
They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benefits: these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately.
The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms.
Some sickness benefits cover the policyholders mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates.
In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and offer policyholders conversion options.
Life savings business A range of contracts are offered in a variety of different forms to meet customers long term savings objectives.
Policyholders may choose to include a number of protection benefits within their savings contracts.
Typically, any guarantees under the contract would only apply on maturity or earlier death.
On certain older contracts there may be provisions guaranteeing surrender benefits.
Savings contracts may or may not guarantee policyholders an investment return.
Where the return is guaranteed, the Group may be exposed to interest rate risk with respect to the backing assets.
Pensions individual and corporate These are long term savings contracts through which policyholders accumulate pension benefits.
Some older contracts contain a basic guaranteed benefit expressed as an amount of pension payable or a guaranteed annuity option, which exposes the Group to interest rate and longevity risk.
These guarantees become more costly during periods when interest rates are low or when annuitant mortality improves faster than expected.
The ultimate cost will also depend on the take-up rate of any option and the final form of annuity selected by the policyholder.
Other options provided by these contracts include an open market option on maturity, early retirement and late retirement.
The Group would generally have discretion over the terms on which these options are offered.
Annuities Deferred and immediate annuity contracts are offered.
Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase.
The income stream from a deferred annuity is delayed until a specified future date.
Bulk annuities are also offered, where the Group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund.
Some non-participating deferred annuities sold by the Group contain guaranteed cash options predominately minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.
The value of such guaranteed options are currently immaterial.
Annuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment.
No surrender value is available under any of these products.
The primary risks to the Group from annuity products are therefore mortality improvements and investment performance.
indd 186 25 03 2011 11:29 gRouP FiNaNcial statemeNts ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 187 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts coNtiNued There is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK non profit business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases.
In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI becomes negative.
The total of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2010 was 247m 2009: 242m.
Thus, 1% negative inflation, which was reversed in the following year would result in a guarantee cost of approximately 2m 2009: 2m.
Negative inflation sustained over a longer period would give rise to significantly greater guarantee costs.
Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative inflation hedges and limited price indexation swaps.
Key risk factors a Insurance risk i Mortality For contracts providing death benefits, higher mortality rates would lead to an increase in claims costs.
For annuity contracts, the Group is exposed to the risk that mortality experience is lower than assumed: lower than expected mortality would require payments to be made for longer and increase the cost of benefits provided.
The Group regularly reviews its mortality experience and industry projections of longevity and adjusts the valuation and pricing assumptions accordingly.
The Group is exposed to mortality risk on protection and annuity business.
For protection products, the Group has entered into reinsurance arrangements to mitigate this risk and provide financing.
ii Persistency In the early years of a policy, lapses and surrenders are likely to result in a loss to the Group, as the acquisition costs associated with the contract would not have been recovered from product margins.
Some contracts include surrender deductions to mitigate this risk.
In later periods, once the acquisition costs have been recouped, the effect of lapses and surrenders depends upon the relationship between the exit benefit, if any, and the liability for that contract.
Exit benefits are not generally guaranteed and the Group has some discretion in determining the amount of the payment.
As a result, the effect on profit in later periods is expected to be broadly neutral.
Following the adoption of PS06 14 in 2006 the persistency assumption for non-participating protection business allows for the expected pattern of persistency, adjusted to incorporate a margin for adverse deviation.
There is no persistency risk exposure for annuities in payment, and these contracts do not provide a lapse or surrender option.
iii Morbidity rates The cost of health related claims depends on both the incidence of policyholders becoming ill and the duration over which they remain ill. Higher than expected incidence or duration would increase costs over the level currently assumed in the calculation of liabilities.
iv Expense variances Higher expenses and or expense inflation will tend to increase the amount of the reserves required.
The Group is exposed to the risk that its liabilities are not sufficient to cover future expenses.
v Geographic concentrations of risk Insurance risk may be concentrated in geographic regions, altering the risk profile of the Group.
The most significant exposure of this type arises for the group protection business, where a single event could result in a large number of related claims.
To reduce the overall exposure, current contracts include an event limit which caps the total liability.
Additionally, excess of loss reinsurance arrangements further mitigate the exposure.
vi Epidemics The spread of an epidemic could cause large aggregate claims across the Groups portfolio.
Quota share reinsurance contracts are used to manage this risk.
The management of associated counterparty risks from the use of reinsurance is set out on page 178.
Depending on the nature of an epidemic, mortality experience may lead to a reduction in the cost of claims for annuity business.
vii Accumulation of risks There is limited potential for single incidents to give rise to a large number of claims across the different contract types written by the Group.
In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long term and short term insurance business written by the Group.
However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure.
These correlations are difficult to estimate though they would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios became more extreme.
An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.

For non-participating business, the strategy is to invest in fixed income securities of appropriate maturity dates.
The risk of default on fixed interest securities is managed through diversified portfolios with exposure limits for individual economies, sectors and counterparties.
Interest rate risk is reduced by managing the duration and maturity structure of each investment portfolio in relation to the estimated cash flows of the liabilities it supports.
A number of derivatives are held to enable the closer matching of assets and liabilities and to mitigate further exposure to interest rate movements, in particular, to limit the exposure to any options and guarantees in contracts.
In addition, the exposure to these risks is allowed for in the actuarial valuation of liabilities under these contracts.
Participating contracts Participating contracts are supported by the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
They offer policyholders the possibility of payment of benefits in addition to those guaranteed by the contract.
The amount and timing of the additional benefits usually called bonuses are contractually at the discretion of the Group.
Discretionary increases to benefits on participating contracts are allowed in one or both of annual and final bonus form.
These bonuses are determined in accordance with the principles outlined in the Groups PPFM for the management of the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The principles include: The with-profits part of the Society LTF will be managed with the objective of ensuring that its assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities without the need for additional capital: With-profits policies have no expectation of any distribution from the with-profits part of the Society LTFs inherited estate.
The inherited estate is the excess of assets held within the Society LTF over and above the amount required to meet liabilities, including those which arise from the regulatory duty to treat customers fairly in settling discretionary benefits: and Bonus rates will be smoothed so that some of the short term fluctuations in the value of the investments of the with-profits part of the Society LTF and the business results achieved in the with-profits part of the UK LTF are not immediately reflected in payments under with-profits policies.
At 30 June 2005 an assessment was made of the expected cost of guarantees and options to be paid in the future, and funds with the same value to meet these costs were allocated from the capital in the with-profits sub-fund.
The value of the funds is regularly assessed and is reduced by the cost of guarantees and options paid since 1 July 2005.
At each assessment point, if the value of the funds is lower than the expected cost of guarantees and options, it is possible to make deductions from asset shares to cover the difference.
It is intended to limit deductions to no more than 0.75% each year, up to a maximum of 5% per policy.
Following the movement in the expected cost and the value of the associated funds up to 31 December 2010, and in accordance with the Groups PPFM, a deduction of 0.2% was made to the asset shares.
This followed a refund of 0.4% made in respect of the year to 31 December 2009.
In the technical provisions, allowance was also made for future deductions in respect of the expected costs of meeting future guarantees and options not covered by the current year deduction.
For policyholders who decide to surrender, a charge will generally be made in respect of the expected cost of guarantees and options not covered by the charge already taken.
Some older participating contracts include a guaranteed minimum rate of roll up of the policyholders fund up to the date of retirement or maturity.
The nature of the participating contracts written in the with-profits part of the Society LTF is that more emphasis can be placed on investing to maximise future investment returns.
This results in a broader range of investments being held within the fund.
With-profits bonds These contracts provide an investment return to the policyholder which is determined by the attribution of regular and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a death benefit, typically of 101% of the value of the units allocated to the policyholder.
Pension contracts The Group has sold pension contracts containing guaranteed annuity options which expose the Group to both interest rate and longevity risk.
The market consistent value of these guarantees carried in the balance sheet is 35m 2009: 31m.
indd 188 25 03 2011 11:29 gRouP FiNaNcial statemeNts ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 189 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts coNtiNued Deferred annuity contracts The Group has written some deferred annuity contracts which guaranteed minimum pensions.
These options expose the Group to interest rate and longevity risk as the cost would be expected to increase with decreasing interest rates and improved longevity.
The market consistent value of these guarantees carried in the balance sheet is 125m 2009: 111m.
Endowment contracts These contracts provide a lump sum on maturity determined by the addition of annual and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a minimum sum assured death benefit.
Key risk factors The insurance and market risk exposures for participating business are largely the same as those discussed for non-participating contracts.
The main differences in the operation of these contracts are discussed below.
a Insurance risk Persistency At early durations, the nature of the persistency risks on with-profits business is largely the same as for non-participating business and is influenced mainly by the ability to recover acquisition costs from product margins.
At later durations, there is less scope for withdrawal to result in a loss for the Group as these contracts typically provide explicit allowances for market conditions.
Allowance for future withdrawals is made in the assessment of participating contract liabilities.
The Group is generally exposed to the risk that future withdrawals are lower than assumed, resulting in higher future guarantee costs.
b Market risk The financial risk exposure for participating contracts is different from that for non-participating business.
Greater emphasis is placed on investing to maximise future investment returns rather than matching assets to liabilities.
This results in holding significant equity and property investments.
Lower investment returns increase the costs associated with maturity and investment guarantees provided on these contracts.
These risks are managed by maintaining capital sufficient to cover the consequences of mismatch under a number of adverse scenarios.
In addition, different investment strategies are followed for assets backing policyholder asset shares and assets backing other participating liabilities and surplus.
The former include significant equity and property holdings, whilst the latter are invested largely in fixed interest securities.
The assets held are managed so as to provide a partial hedge to movements in fixed interest yields and equity markets.
The methodology used to calculate the liabilities for participating contracts makes allowance for the possibility of adverse changes in investment markets on a basis consistent with the market cost of hedging the guarantees provided.
The methodology also makes allowance for the cost of future discretionary benefits, guarantees and options.
The value of future discretionary benefits depends on the return achieved on assets backing these contracts.
The asset mix varies with investment conditions reflecting the Groups investment policy, which aims to optimise returns to policyholders over time whilst limiting capital requirements for this business.
The distribution of surplus to shareholders depends upon the bonuses declared for the period.
Typically, bonus rates are set having regard to investment returns, although the Group has some discretion setting rates and would normally smooth bonuses over time.
The volatility of investment returns could impact the funds capital position and its ability to pay bonuses.
If future investment conditions were less favourable than anticipated, the lower bonus levels resulting would also reduce future distributions to shareholders.
However, business which is written in the with-profits part of the Society LTF is managed to be self-supporting.
The unallocated divisible surplus in the fund would normally be expected to absorb the impact of these investment risks.
Only in extreme scenarios, where shareholders were required to provide capital support to the with-profits part of the Society LTF, would these risks affect equity.
As part of the 2007 Society LTF restructure, the 1996 Sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
As a result, Societys Board of Directors undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment reduced to 400m in 2010 and will then gradually reduce to zero over a period not exceeding eight years.
The Groups approach to setting bonus rates is designed to treat customers fairly.
The approach is set out in the Societys PPFM for the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
In addition, bonus declarations are also affected by FSA regulations relating to Treating Customers Fairly TCF, which limit the discretion available when setting bonus rates.
The Groups approach to setting bonuses and meeting the FSAs TCF regulations may increase the Groups exposure to market risk should the ability to cut bonuses, during periods when investment returns are poor, be reduced.

The Group is also exposed to the risk of an expense overrun should the market depress the level of charges which could be imposed, although for some contracts the Group has discretion over the level of management charges levied.

In practice, items of the Groups experience may be correlated.
The Group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position.
A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities.
The analysis also ignores any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the Group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.
These stresses use the assets that back the liabilities.
Any excess assets have not been stressed in these calculations.
The sensitivity of the profit to changes in assumptions may not be linear.
They should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.
The change in interest rate test assumes a 100 basis point change in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with a 100 basis point change in the real yields on variable securities.
Valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields adjusted to allow for the impact of FSA regulations.
In the sensitivity for credit spreads corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions.
The inflation stress adopted is a 1% pa increase in inflation resulting in a 1% pa reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield.
In addition the expense inflation rate is increased by 1% pa.
The reinsurer stress shown is equal to the technical provisions ceded to that insurer.
The annuitant mortality stress is a 5% reduction in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates so for example a rate that was 80% of a standard table would become 76% of that standard table.
Default of largest reinsurer: The largest reinsurer was deduced at an entity level by mathematical reserves ceded.
The largest reinsurer is Swiss Re.
The increase in reserves is consistent with the reinsured reserves.

LGA also has smaller blocks of in-force deferred and immediate annuities.
The individual term assurances provide death benefits over the medium to long term.
The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums increasing annually thereafter.
During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract.
After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age related guaranteed premium.
Reinsurance is used to reduce the insurance risk on this portfolio and manage liquidity risks, through the reinsurance commission received under quota share arrangements.
Reinsurance and securitisation are used to provide regulatory solvency relief including relief from regulation Triple X.
These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the Groups balance sheet.
The universal life insurance and deferred annuities provide a savings component.
In addition, the universal life contract provides substantial death benefits over the medium to long term.
The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate.
LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate.
LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.
The reserves for universal life and deferred annuities totalled $708m and $218m respectively at 31 December 2010 $723m and $221m at 31 December 2009 respectively.
The guaranteed interest rates associated with those reserves ranged from 0% to 5.5%, with the majority of the policies having guaranteed rates ranging from 3% to 4% 2009: 4%.
The deferred annuity contracts also contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.
The other annuity contracts have similar risks to those in the UK.
Legal & General Netherlands LGN LGN principally writes non-participating Euro savings, individual term assurance and annuity business.
The Euro savings business includes an exposure to interest rate and credit risk: an active asset-liability management programme is in place.

This provides information about the value which is being created on the Groups long term insurance contracts.
EV information is calculated for the Groups life and pensions business covered business.
All other businesses are accounted for on the IFRS basis adopted in the primary financial statements.
The EV methodology requires assets of an insurance company, as reported in the primary financial statements, to be attributed between those supporting the covered business and the remainder.
The method accounts for assets in the covered business on an EV basis and the remainder of the Groups assets on the IFRS basis adopted in the primary financial statements.
Sensitivities have been presented for covered business only.
In this context the non-covered business is considered not to be material.
Whilst EV sensitivities do not directly reflect the short term movements under IFRS, they more closely reflect the long term economic outturn.
Cash flow projections are determined using realistic assumptions for each component of cash flow and for each policy group.
Future economic and investment return assumptions are based on conditions at the end of the financial year.
Future investment returns are projected by one of two methods.
The first method is based on an assumed investment return attributed to assets at their market value.
The second, which is used in the US, where the investments of that subsidiary are substantially all fixed interest, projects the cash flows from the current portfolio of assets and assumes an investment return on reinvestment of surplus cash flows.
The assumed discount and inflation rates are consistent with the investment return assumptions.
The main assumptions are provided on page 214 in the Supplementary Financial Statements.
uk general insurance The principal products are: Household.
These contracts provide cover in respect of policyholders homes, investment properties, contents, personal belongings and incidental liabilities which they may incur as a property owner, occupier and individual.
Exposure is normally limited to the rebuilding cost of the home, the replacement cost of belongings and a policy limit in respect of liability claims.
LGI uses reinsurance to manage the exposure to an accumulation of claims arising from any one incident, usually severe weather.
The catastrophe cover runs from 1 July to 30 June and reinsures LGI for losses between 30m and 235m 2009 2010: 30m and 250m for a single weather event.
Accident, sickness and unemployment ASU.
These contracts provide cover in respect of continuing payment liabilities incurred by customers when they are unable to work as a result of accident, sickness or unemployment.
They protect predominantly mortgage payments.
Exposure is limited to the monthly payment level selected by the customer sufficient to cover the payment and associated costs, up to the duration limit specified in the policy, usually 12 months.
These contracts provide cover in respect of customers private cars and their liability to third parties in respect of damage to property and injury.
Exposure is normally limited to the replacement value of the vehicle, and a policy limit in respect of third party property damage.
Exposure to third party bodily injury is unlimited in accordance with statutory requirements.
The motor book continues in run-off, the final policy having expired in August 2007, but this is expected to take several years.
These contracts primarily in run-off protect a mortgage lender should an insured property be repossessed and subsequently sold at a loss.
Since 1993, the contract has included a maximum period of cover of ten years, and a cap on the maximum claim.
For business accepted prior to 1993, cover is unlimited and lasts until the insured property is remortgaged or redeemed.
Key risk factors Weather events Significant weather events such as windstorms, and coastal and river floods can lead to significant claims.
Concentration The insurance of properties which are concentrated in high risk areas, or an above average market share in a particular region, can give rise to a concentration of insurance risk.
This risk is managed by ensuring that the risk acceptance policy, terms and premiums both reflect the expected claim cost associated with the location and avoid adverse selection.
Additionally, exposure and competitor activity is monitored by location to ensure that there is a geographic spread of business.
Catastrophe reinsurance cover reduces the Groups exposure to concentrations of risk.
The catastrophe reinsurance is designed to protect against a modelled windstorm and coastal flood event with a return probability of 1 in 200 years.

The Groups underwriting and reinsurance strategy mitigates the exposure to concentrations of risk arising from geographic location or adverse selection.
Economic downturn Periods of rapid and prolonged national economic downturn can create significant variation in the frequency and severity of ASU claims experience.
This risk is managed through the monitoring of economic trends and the underwriting of policies to ensure that the customer completing a mortgage loan transaction achieves credit scoring approval.
