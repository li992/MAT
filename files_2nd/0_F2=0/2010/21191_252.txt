These internal lending arrangements, which net out on consolidation, arise in relation to the following: Aviva International Insurance Limited AII acts as both a UK general insurer and as the primary holding company for our foreign subsidiaries.

These mechanisms also allow for some of the assets of the general insurance business to be made available for use across the Group.
