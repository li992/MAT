Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Other information 193 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 Ore reserves And MinerAl resOurces ZInc estimates as at 31 December 2010 OTHEr mININg aND INDuSTrIal The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2007 and the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as applicable.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.

For the polymetallic deposits, the tonnage figures apply to each metal.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
Black Mountain plus Gamsberg and Lisheen are reported because the sale of these operations was not finalised by 31 December 2010.
However, the sale of Black Mountain and Lisheen was completed on 4 February 2011 and 15 February 2011 respectively.
1 Black Mountain deeps: Broken Hill and the Deeps Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are combined for reporting purposes as both deposits are geologically connected and make use of the same mining infrastructure.
A higher cut-off was applied in 2010 and the exchange rate increased reducing the overall revenue in ZAR terms.
These two effects outweighed the higher metal price used in 2010 and a decrease in both Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources is attributed to these factors.
However a change in estimation methodology limited the decrease.
Measured and Indicated Resources are estimated to contain 9.7Mt of material grading 50.9 g t silver as a by-product.
Inferred Resources are estimated to contain 9.6Mt of material grading 24.9 g t silver as a by-product.
2 lisheen: Changes in Ore Reserves are largely attributable to production, with sterilisation of ore due to back-filling on a retreat mining sequence accounting for the reduction in Mineral Resources.
Mineral Resources are constrained by geological parameters total sulphide content and ore thickness and are quoted above a 6% ZnEq cut-off.
3 Black Mountain swartberg: Indicated Resources are estimated to contain 16.4Mt of material grading 35.4 g t silver as a by-product.
Inferred Resources are estimated to contain 31.9Mt of material grading 32.2 g t silver as a by-product.
4 Gamsberg north: Mineral Resources are constrained within mineralized horizons and within a pit shell and are reported above a cut-off grade of 3% Zn.
During 2010, 50kt of material containing an estimated 4.3 kt Zinc was mined via the exploration adit and processed at the Black Mountain concentrator.
5 Gamsberg east: Gamsberg East is located 4km south east of Gamsberg North.
Mineral Resources are constrained by geology and are quoted above a 7% Zn cut-off and are supported by a positive concept study for an underground mine undertaken in 2009.
The study has recommended that Gamsberg East is incorporated in the Gamsberg North pre-feasibility study.
Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statements were carried out by independent consultants during 2010 at the following operations: Black Mountain.
