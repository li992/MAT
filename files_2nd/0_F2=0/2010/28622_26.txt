The collection and ageing of trade and other receivables are reviewed on a periodic basis by management.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Companys principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below shows the repricing profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

Foreign exchange risk The Company does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk.
The table below summarises the Companys exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December 2010.
Included in the table are the Companys financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.

A 10% strengthening of the Euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The Company is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 39.
At 31 December 2010, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the statement of financial position was 3,087,000 2009: 2,932,000: 2008: 2,991,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 309,000 2009: 293,000: 2008: 299,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

The accounting policies set out in note 34 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 and in preparation of an opening IFRS statement of financial position at 31 December 2008 the opening position on 1 January 2009, the date of the Companys transition to IFRS.
In preparing its opening IFRS statement of financial position, the Company has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from previous UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Companys reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following notes and tables.
Transitional arrangements IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
The Companys application of the optional exemptions is as follows: Assets and liabilities measured at the Groups transition date to IFRS The Company has taken advantage of the option given in IFRS 1 to measure its assets and liabilities at the carrying amounts that were included in the Groups consolidated financial statements, based on the Groups transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
Employee benefits The Company has chosen to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses associated with its defined benefit pension schemes since the date of transition in other comprehensive income.
Investments in subsidiaries The Company has elected to recognise its investments in subsidiaries at their deemed cost, which was the historical carrying value under UK GAAP.
Other investments The Company has elected to classify equity instruments with a previous carrying value of 2,932,000 as available for sale investments.
Rathbone Brothers Plc 127 Notes to the Company financial statements Report and accounts 2010 51 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Key impacts of IFRS The significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS which impact on the Companys reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows are set out below: IAS 1 and IAS 39 Presentation of Financial Statements and Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The statement of financial position and applicable notes have been amended to reflect the presentational disclosures required by IAS 1 and IAS 39.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement In accordance with IAS 39, the Company has recognised gains or losses on revaluation of available for sale equity securities in other comprehensive income.
IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 12 requires that deferred tax on equity items is recognised directly in equity.
UK GAAP requires that all such deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss.
In addition, deferred tax is recognised on available for sale assets under IAS 12.
No such deferred tax is recognised under UK GAAP.
Reported profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2009 has consequently been increased by 2,321,000.
Statement of financial position equity at 31 December 2008 was increased by 824,000 and statement of financial position equity at 31 December 2009 was increased by 807,000.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Under UK GAAP, the deficit on defined benefit pension schemes is shown net of related deferred tax.
Under IFRS, the deferred tax is shown with other deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Accordingly a deferred tax asset of 3,434,000 2008: 1,602,000 was reclassified on transition to IFRS.
IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows The Company has prepared its statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 7.
Under IAS 7, the statement of cash flows shows the movement in cash and cash equivalents, being defined as cash in hand, demand deposits and short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Under UK GAAP, the Company was exempt from the requirement to prepare a statement of cash flows.
