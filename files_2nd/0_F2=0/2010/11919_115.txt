The Group operates the following equity-settled employee option and share plans: Worldwide Save for Shares Plan Since 1994, the Group has operated a Save-As-You-Earn plan for UK employees.
In 1998, theGroup introduced a Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
Under these plans, employees can save a portion of their monthlysalary over periods of three, five or seven years.
At the end of this period, the employee has the option to purchase ordinary shares with the accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 80% of the market price prevailing at the time of the commencement of the employees participation in the plan.
Options that are not exercised within six months of the end of the savings period lapse unconditionally.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2000, the Group established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows all employees inthe US to save a portion of their monthly salary over six month periods.
At the end of the period, the employee has the option to purchase ADRs with their accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the market price prevailing at the beginning or end of the period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and renewed in 2006 and consists of two parts: share options and or restricted shares.
Options were last granted under this plan in 2001 based on a pre-grant earnings per share growth test and are not subject to further performance conditions on exercise.
The options became exercisable in tranches and lapse if they remain unexercised at the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
introduction our strateGy our perFormance our impact on society Governance Financial statements section 6 Financial statements 147 26. share-based payments continued The vesting of restricted shares is normally dependent on continuing service over a three to five-year period, and in the case of senior management upon the satisfaction of corporate performance targets over a three-year period.
These targets may be based on market and or non-market performance criteria.
Restricted shares awarded to senior management in March 2009 and March 2010 vest dependent on relative total shareholder return, return on invested capital and earnings per share growth.
The award was split equally across all three measures.
Other restricted shares awarded in 2009 and 2010 vest depending on continuing service over a three-year period.
Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan This plan permits executive directors and senior executives around the Group to invest up to 50% of any after tax annual bonus in Pearson shares.
If these shares are held and the Group meets an earnings per share growth target, the company will match them on a gross basis i. e. the maximum number of matching shares is equal to the number of shares that could have been acquired with the amount of the pre-tax annual bonus taken in invested shares.
In addition to the above, share options remain outstanding under Executive Share Option, Reward and Special Share Option Plans.
These are legacy plans which were replaced with the introduction of the Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2001.
