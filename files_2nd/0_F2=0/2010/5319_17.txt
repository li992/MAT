These were partially offset by a Company cash payment of 2.9m to settle a proportion of the schemes liabilities resulting in a net accounting credit of 1.9m.
In 2009, the one-off net income, excluded from headline profit, of 9.9m comprised: income due to the accounting benefits of the changes made to the UK defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008 of 17.5m: 6.8m costs associated with reorganisation activities across the Group and 0.8m UK defined benefit pension scheme costs due to these reorganisation activities.

In addition to the pensions costs above there was a net credit of 1.9m excluded from headline operating profit due to changes to the German defined benefit pension scheme.
Details of this are disclosed within note 7 to the Group accounts.
6 Share-based payments The Group has a number of share-based incentive plans for employees.
These comprise Deferred Shares awarded to the Groups most senior executives, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awarded to senior managers and employees, a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme that is made available to the majority of employees.
Until 2008 a US s423 option scheme was offered to all permanent employees in the US operating company and until 2005 there was a Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP awarding options to senior managers.
The LTIOP was in operation before 7 November 2002 in addition to a pre-existing Long Term Incentive Plan.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have only been applied to grants made, under the LTIOP scheme, after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
The total charge included in the Income Statement in the year was 2.4m 2009: 1.2m.
Deferred Share Bonus plan In 2009 the Group reviewed the overall remuneration package for Executive Directors and the Groups most senior executives.
The review concluded the need for an additional incentive for participants of the Executive Incentive Scheme after its expiry in respect of the year ended 31 March 2009.
From March 2009, any cash bonus awarded will also attract deferred shares in the Group equivalent to 50% of the cash bonus.
These deferred shares will be released after two years subject to continued employment.
In light of the cost reduction programme and performance for the year ended 31 March 2009, it was determined that no bonus payments would be made to the Groups most senior executives and therefore no deferred shares were awarded as part of the scheme.
Deferred shares relating to bonus awards to senior managers for the year ended 31 March 2010 will be granted in June 2010.
Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIOP schemes were awarded to key senior employees at a grant price equal to the Groups share price.
The vesting conditions include a continuation of service for a minimum of three years, and the performance of the Groups shares against a comparator group.
The share price is tested against this group after three years and can be retested after four and five years if the options have not vested.
The proportion of the options vesting is also dependent on the comparative share performance.
The share options can be exercised up to 10 years after the grant date.
Any options remaining unexercised after 10 years from the date of grant will expire.
In June 2006 a new Executive Plan the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP conditional award of shares was made.
The vesting conditions are based on performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 over the three year life of the scheme.
At the vesting date the share award will either vest or lapse.
The awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
In June 2007 a further conditional award of shares was made.
In June 2008 the terms and conditions of the LTIP were modified such that the vesting conditions are based on both the performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 and growth in Earnings per Share over the life of the scheme.
There were no changes to the scheme in June 2009.

Save As You Earn SAYE schemes The SAYE schemes are available to the majority of employees of the Group.
They provide an option price equal to the daily average market price at the date of the offer.
The option exercise conditions are the employees continued employment for the three or five year period and the maintenance of employees regular monthly savings in an account.
Failure of either of these conditions is deemed a forfeiture of the option.
At the end of the period the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with the accrued interest.
There are no market conditions to the vesting of the options.
US s423 scheme The US s423 scheme was available to permanent employees of Allied Electronics Inc, the Groups US operating company.
The options were granted to those who elect to participate and the scheme has a savings element similar to the SAYE scheme.
The option price is the lesser of 85% of the market value of the shares on the date of grant and the date of exercise.

COM NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 7 Pension schemes The funding of the United Kingdom defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2010 amounted to 3.9m 2009: 3.2m excluding a one-off credit due to pension scheme changes and curtailments of 16.7m.
The contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 3.1m 2009: 2.6m.
The rules of the UK Electrocomponents Group Pension scheme give the Trustee powers to wind up the scheme, which it may exercise if the Trustee is aware that the assets of the scheme are insufficient to meet its liabilities.
Although the scheme is currently in deficit, the Trustee and the Company have agreed a plan to eliminate the deficit over time and the Trustee has confirmed that it has no current intention of exercising its power to wind up the scheme.
The Group operated a defined benefit pension scheme in Germany for which operating costs were 0.4m 2009: 1.2m.
During the year the defined benefit pension scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual and around 85% of the schemes active members accepted a cash payment to settle their past service obligations.
The accounting effects of these actions were a curtailment gain of 1.8m and a settlement gain of 3.0m.
These amounts, offset by the 2.9m payment by the company to remove the past scheme obligations, are disclosed as a net income of 1.9m excluded from headline operating profit see note 4.
The costs of the defined benefit pension scheme in Ireland were 0.2m 2009: 0.1m.
The costs of the defined contribution schemes in Australia, North America, Germany and Ireland were 1.1m 2009: 1.3m, and those via government schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and North Asia were 3.2m 2009: 3.2m.
The Group expects to pay 5.2m to its UK defined benefit pension scheme in 2011.
During the year, the Group adopted IFRIC interpretation 14 which defines the interaction of the defined benefit assets and any minimum funding requirement.
There has been no impact in either the current or preceding period year as a result of adopting this interpretation.
The principal assumptions used in the valuations of the liabilities of the Groups schemes were: 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 United Republic United Republic Kingdom Germany of Ireland Kingdom Germany of Ireland Discount rate 5.40% 4.60% 4.60% 6.25% 5.90% 5.90% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.55% 3.00% 3.00% 2.55% 3.00% 4.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.30% 2.00% 2.00% 3.00% 2.75% 2.75% Inflation assumption 3.40% 2.00% 2.00% 3.00% 2.75% 2.75% The assumption on the rate of increase of pensionable salaries in the UK scheme has been restricted.
This is due to the introduction of salary capping entitlement arrangements with respect to the defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008.

Value in use calculations The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on actual operating results together with management projections for five years.
These cash flows are based on extrapolations from earlier budgets and forecasts.
These are subject to assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions: for example by examining the causes of differences between past cash flow projections and actual cash flows.
Cash flows for further periods, i. e. beyond five years, are extrapolated using a long term annual growth rate of 2% 2009: 2% which is consistent with the market estimate long-term average growth rate for the industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9% 2009: 9% has been applied in calculating the discounted projected cash flows.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used are the sales growth rate and discount rate.
The sales growth rate is prepared using internal forecasts based upon historical growth rates and future medium term plans together with relevant macro economic indicators.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the long-term average growth rates for the industry and do not exceed expected long term GDP growth.
The discount rate is based upon the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC at 31 March 2010 and has been calculated reflecting market assessments at that time.
The Directors believe that currently all reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions referred to above would not give rise to an impairment charge.
Outcome of calculations The recoverable amount of the Allied Electronics Inc. cash generating unit exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.

A Derivative financial assets and liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves and valuing any amounts denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices.
Level 2 as defined by IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
B Interest-bearing loans held at fair value These comprise foreign currency denominated interest bearing loans which are subject to hedge accounting.
The foreign currency amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
C Cash and cash equivalents, Bank overdrafts, Interest-bearing loans held at amortised cost Cash and cash equivalents largely comprise local bank account balances, which typically bear interest at rates set by reference to local applicable rates or cash float balances which have not yet cleared for interest purposes.
Fair values are estimated to equate to carrying amounts as their re-pricing maturity is less than one year.
Interest bearing loans held at amortised cost comprise fixed rate foreign currency denominated loans.
For carrying values the foreign currency principal amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and are all unsecured.
They bear interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
D Finance lease liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
E Other financial assets and liabilities Fair values of receivables and payables are determined by discounting future cash flows.
For amounts with a repricing maturity of less than one year, fair value is assumed to approximate to the carrying amount.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT 2010 71 20 Financial instruments continued Risk management objectives and policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, market and credit.
Each of these are managed in accordance with Board approved policies.
The policies are set out below.
Liquidity risk The Groups key priority is to ensure that it can meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group ensures this by having sufficient committed debt facilities in place to meet its anticipated funding requirements.
The Groups forecast funding requirements and its committed debt facilities are reported to and monitored by the Treasury Committee monthly.
As at 31 March 2010 the Group had the following committed debt finance in place: a syndicated multicurrency facility for 142m, $137m and 47m with a maturity of September 2012: a fully drawn bank facility for Yen 800m with a maturity of December 2010: a fully drawn, amortising, bank facility of 1.8m with a final maturity of December 2011 secured on the Bad Hersfeld warehouse: Private Placement notes of $37.5m with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017.
The Group also had investor commitment to buy a further $112.5m of Private Placement notes in June 2010, with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017.
As at 31 March 2010, the Group had available 131.6m of undrawn committed debt facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Group also uses bank overdrafts, uncommitted short term money market loans, cash and short term investments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups day to day funding and liquidity requirements.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including contractual future interest payments.

COM NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 20 Financial instruments continued Market risk Foreign currency transactional risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk because most operating companies have some level of payables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Some operating companies also have receivables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Hedging of currency exposures during periods when operating companies cannot easily change their selling prices is implemented in order to shelter the forecast gross profits during those periods.
In this way the impacts of currency fluctuations can be smoothed until selling prices can be changed in the light of movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Group Treasury based on trading projections provided by the operating companies.
In addition specific cash flows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
The Group classifies forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments against forecast receivables payables and designates them as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.
The forecast cash flows are expected to occur evenly throughout the period for 17 months from the year end, and will affect the income statement in the period in which they occur.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts not used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2010 was Nil 2009: 1.8m.
Foreign currency transaction exposures, and the hedges in place to mitigate them, are monitored monthly by the Treasury Committee.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency transactional risk has materially altered during the year.
Foreign currency translational risk During the year ended 31 March 2010 the Group issued $37.5m of Private Placement Notes, with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017, and, using cross currency interest rate swaps, swapped $36.25m to 22.5m at a floating interest rate.
The Group also obtained investor commitment to buy, in June 2010, a further $112.5m of Private Placement Notes, again with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017, and again using crosscurrency interest rate swaps the Group swapped $63.75m to 14.8m and 28.3m at floating interest rates.
All these cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and are expected to remain highly effective over the life of the Private Placement notes.
The Group has designated certain external loans as net investment hedges against its investments in its US and European subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the US hedge as at 31 March 2010 was $170m 111.8m, of which $90m 59.2m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and $80m 52.6m was in the form of an overdraft.
The carrying amount of the Euro hedge was 65m 58.0m, of which 25m 22.3m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and 40m 35.7m was in the form of an overdraft.
Both the US Dollar and Euro overdrafts are shown in the balance sheet netted with positive cash balances, as there is an absolute right of set-off.
The carrying value of these $ and hedges remained unchanged, and 100% effective, throughout the year ended 31 March 2010 and the year ended 31 March 2009.
A foreign exchange gain of 9.2m 2009: loss 41.7m was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to Sterling in the year ended 31 March 2010.
No other foreign currency translation exposures are explicitly hedged although local currency debt is used where economic and fiscally efficient in the financing of subsidiaries and this provides a degree of natural hedging.
Guidelines are in place to manage the currency mix of the Groups net debt.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency translational risk has materially altered during the year.
Interest rate risk The Group has relatively high interest cover and therefore for this reason the Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving most of its interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
The Group does not believe its interest rate risk has materially altered during the year.
As at 31 March 2010 the Group had: Fixed the interest on $90m borrowings from its syndicated bank facility until June 2011 using an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge Swapped $36.25m of its Private Placement Notes from $ fixed to floating using an interest rate swap.
This is designated as a fair value hedge.
Swapped from a fixed rate of 1.15% to floating, the interest on its Yen 800m bank facility, maturity December 2010 using an interest rate swap.
Swapped from a fixed rate of 3.85% to floating, the interest on its 1.8m amortising bank facility maturity December 2011 using an interest rate swap.
All other borrowings were at a variable rate.

The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties, customers and geographic locations.
As such the Group does not believe its credit risk has materially altered during the year.
The Group identifies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings, and that these limits are not exceeded.
Trade and other receivables All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
Trading receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience of customers and assessment of their current economic environment.
There are no significant individual allowances for doubtful receivables included within this amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis monthly by the Treasury Committee.
Given the profile of our customers, whereby credit risk is spread amongst a large number of customers with small balances, no further material credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.

COM NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS continued 21 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 0.3 0.1 10.6 11.2 10.3 11.1 Goodwill 39.6 36.9 39.6 36.9 Retirement benefit obligations 3.5 1.9 3.5 1.9 Inventories 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.2 Employee benefits 1.8 0.9 1.8 0.9 Provisions 1.4 2.3 1.4 2.3 Other items 1.0 3.4 0.2 0.3 0.8 3.1 Tax losses 18.3 19.4 18.3 19.4 Tax assets liabilities 26.4 28.1 50.4 48.7 24.0 20.6 Set off of tax 16.5 17.4 16.5 17.4 Net tax assets liabilities 9.9 10.7 33.9 31.3 24.0 20.6 A deferred tax asset has been recognised for tax losses where current projections show that sufficient taxable profits will arise in the near future against which these losses may be offset.
2010 2009 m m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Tax losses 16.2 14.0 A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of tax losses which can be carried forward against future taxable income as recoverability is uncertain.
At the balance sheet date, the estimated aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 5.9m 2009: 5.9m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Further, the Group has sufficient relevant losses to offset fully the 5.9m liability.
Deferred tax is provided at the standard rate of corporation tax applicable at the balance sheet date unless there is legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date changing the rate.
