The ratio of current and future capital resources to regulated business revenue is reported monthly to Management to ensure compliance.
There have been no instances of non-compliance in either the current or previous years.
Homecare Insurance Limited Homecare Insurance Limited is regulated by the FSA as an insurance underwriter, and therefore maintains its capital resources in accordance with the FSAs risk-based solvency regime, Individual Capital Adequacy Standards ICAS.
The current and future capital levels are reviewed each month to ensure ongoing compliance and are reported to the FSA quarterly.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of non-derivative financial instruments are determined using pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions.

Compliance with financial ratios and other covenant obligations of the Groups bank loans is monitored on a monthly basis by the Board of Directors.

The lines of policies underwritten are limited to General Insurance Classes underwritten by an entity within the Group which is authorised by the FSA.
The lines of risk underwritten are restricted by the Group to those lines where the Group either has substantial experience or lines where the Group wishes to move into where it can enter such a line of business in a risk-controlled manner after appropriate Board consideration.
The Groups lines of insurance business and thus its insurance risk portfolio is primarily focused on high volume, low transaction value, short term individual lines.
The Group has in place reinsurance arrangements to transfer a level of claims risk to third parties.
The level reinsured being determined by periodic, and at least annual, reviews.
The Groups policy is to establish a specific claims reserve at any point in time on each line of business, based on claims reported up to and including the last day of each accounting period including an element to represent claims incurred but not yet reported.
Details of claims reserves carried are provided in note 23.
The Directors consider the following to be the principal insurance risks and actions taken reducing risk to an acceptable level: Changes in rates of claims Trends in claim rates and other market data are reviewed on a regular basis and premiums for new contracts adjusted accordingly.
Each class of contract has a large population of homogenous policyholders and no insurance contracts are subject to concentration risk.
A 10% deterioration in the loss ratio during the year would have resulted in a 917,000 reduction in profit before tax and shareholders equity 2009: 304,000, 10% representing the Directors assessment of the reasonably possible change in the loss ratio.
Changes in settlement cost per claim The quantum or nature of settlement amounts is specified in policy documentation and the Group is not exposed to significant open ended commitments, since where settlement costs are not capped they vary within a small range.
Where possible, contractual arrangements with suppliers and other parties seek to limit the amount per claim.
Reliance on key suppliers The Group makes use of third party suppliers to efficiently settle some claims.
The performance and financial position of key suppliers is regularly monitored and alternative lines of supply sourced as necessary.
The Group therefore considers its exposure to risk arising from its insurance contracts to be appropriately managed.
