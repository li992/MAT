As no actual liability exists at the balance sheet date, no provision is made in relation to movements in the claims equalisation reserve.
However, as a claims equalisation reserve is still a requirement of PRU, an amount equal to the claims equalisation reserve is transferred from retained earnings to other reserves in the shareholders funds.
Deferred tax is not included in this transfer.
