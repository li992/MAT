Deferral of acquisition costs: Post sale set up costs are recognised on a straight line basis over the expected life of the policy.
Commission costs are recognised on a straight line basis from the end of the initial acceptance period over the expected life of the relevant policies, taking account of the expected levels of cancellations.
Changes to the expected life of classes of policies will therefore impact the period in which these items are recognised.
There have been no significant changes in these assumptions during the current or previous years.
