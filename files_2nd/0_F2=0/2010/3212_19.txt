Financial Statements Notes to the Company Balance Sheet I.
Principal accounting policies of the Company Accounting principles The Company Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards consistently applied and under the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the going concern basis.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 was 361 million 2009: 132 million loss.
Presentation of derivative financial instruments In line with the Groups accounting policy for derivative financial instruments, the Company has classified those derivatives held for the purpose of treasury management as current or non-current, based on expected settlement dates.
Employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes, detailed in note 35, under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of nonmarket-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions, whereby an addition to the Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings is reported with a corresponding increase in shareholders funds.
The addition to the Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings is reduced on the issue of share incentives as these are recharged to the subsidiaries.
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the different schemes as follows: LTIS EPS award Market value on the date of grant LTIS TSR award A Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total shareholder return performance Sharesave Black-Scholes ESOS Black-Scholes using an adjusted option life assumption to reflect the possibility of early exercise SAS, SIP, DMSS, RSS, ESPP and DBP Market value on the date of grant Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into pounds sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities and transactions are taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included in the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the cost attributable to bringing it to its working condition for its intended use.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives of up to ten years.
Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis.
Investments Fixed asset investments are held in the Balance Sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment as necessary.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Companys employees participate in a number of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes as described in note 36 to the Group Financial Statements.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore accounts for the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The charge to the Profit and Loss Account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in the accounting period.
Details of the defined benefit schemes of the Group accounted for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies detailed in note 2 to the Group Financial Statements can be found in note 36 to the Group Financial Statements.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

Principal accounting policies of the Company continued Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
