FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: CONTINUED Exchange rates and sensitivity analysis continued The following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
Also noted is the increase in profit that a one US Dollar cent change in exchange rate, where the foreign currency is strengthening against Sterling, might have on the Groups results.
The method of estimation involves assessing the impact of this currency on the Groups transactions assuming all other variables are unchanged.

The fair value of these contracts at the year end resulted in a profit of 172,000 2009 loss 5,415,000 see note 21.
The Group classifies its forward contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
Further details are noted in the Treasury policies on page 14.
Net assets and associated borrowings The Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were: Net assets of Currency Base borrowing subsidiary borrowing interest rate Currency 000 000 % US Dollar 23,750 20,654 0.25% Japanese Yen 14,836 13,632 0.25% Euro 21,824 21,293 1.00% The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
In order to minimise the cost of these borrowings, short-term currency swaps are used on a rolling one-month cycle, so that at the year end, the currency borrowings are not in existence but forward contracts are in place to re-establish the currency borrowing shortly after the year end.
These currency swaps are not reflected in the table above.
For the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries not hedged, a 5% change in exchange rates will affect reserves by approximately 400,000.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base and to maintain a balance between significant returns to shareholders, with a progressive dividend policy, whilst ensuring the security of the Group supported by a sound capital position.
