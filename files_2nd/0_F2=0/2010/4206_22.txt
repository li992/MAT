Financial statements Notes to the Company accounts A.
Profit and loss account Of the Groups profit for the year, 38.5m 2009: 28.7m is dealt with in the profit and loss account of the Company which was approved by the Board on 8 March 2011 but which is not presented as permitted by s. 408 Companies Act 2006.
Included in the Company profit and loss account is a charge of 0.1m 2009: 0.1m in respect of the Companys audit fee.
Retirement benefit obligations The Companys employees are members of the UK defined benefit schemes, details of which are disclosed in note 12 to the Group accounts.
Whilst the Group reports under IFRS, the UK GAAP equivalent figures for the UK schemes would not be significantly different.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of of the schemes, due mainly to changes in the Groups corporate structure over the years, the Company has accounted as though the schemes were defined contribution schemes and has charged the contributions paid each year to the profit and loss account.

Share based payments The total charge for the year in respect of share based remuneration schemes was 3.4m 2009: 2.0m.
In addition, as the Company has issued options over its own shares to employees of its subsidiary companies, the Company has to increase the cost of its investment in the relevant subsidiary by the fair value of the options granted.
The key elements of each scheme along with the assumptions employed to arrive at the charge in the income statement are set out below.
Where appropriate the expected volatility has been based on historic volatility considering daily share price movements over periods equal to the expected future life of the awards and the risk free rate is based on the Bank of Englands projected nominal yield curve with appropriate duration.
Croda Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE scheme, established in 1983, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise price, being the market price of the Companys shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%.
Employees then enter into a savings contract over three to five years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are then exercisable for a six month period following completion of the savings contract.
As the option is equity settled, under IFRS 2 charges are only made in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002.
For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows: Grant date 2010 Share price at grant date 1431p Exercise price 1144p Number of employees 370 Shares under option 94,501 Vesting period 3 years Expected volatility 35% Option life 6 months Expected life Risk free rate 1.3% Dividend yield 1.7% Possibility of forfeiture 7.5% p. a.

Share based payments continued Croda International Overseas Sharesave Scheme International The International scheme, established in 1999, has the same option pricing model, savings contract and vesting period as the SAYE scheme.
At exercise, employees are paid a cash equivalent for each option purchased, being the difference between the exercise price and market price at the exercise date.
As the scheme is cash settled, IFRS 2 applies to all options in existence during the year, regardless of grant date.
For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows: Grant date 2010 Share price at grant date 1431p Exercise price 1144p Number of employees 975 Shares under option 308,455 Vesting period 3 years Expected volatility 35% Option life 1 month Expected life - Risk free rate 1.0% Dividend yield 1.5% Possibility of forfeiture 7.5% p. a.

Share based payments continued Croda International Senior Executive Share Option Schemes Executive The Group previously granted options to senior employees each year which are subject to satisfaction of performance conditions before they can be exercised.
The performance conditions are discussed in detail in the directors remuneration report page 32.
As with the SAYE scheme, the Executive Scheme is equity settled and as a consequence only the options granted in 2003 fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
No further options will be granted under this scheme.

Under the SIP scheme, employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month.
For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards a matching share which passes to the employee after three years service.
The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation.
