The results and cash flows of these operations have been translated into sterling at an average rate for the year of 1 0.85 2009: 1 0.88 and 1 US$1.55 2009: 1 US$1.57.
Assets and liabilities have been translated at the year-end rate of 1 0.86 2009: 1 0.88 and 1 US$1.57 2009: 1 US$1.61.
Total foreign currency movements during 2010 resulted in a gain recognised in the income statement of 34 million 2009: 154 million gain.
2 Presentation changes a Pension scheme net finance costs In financial years prior to and including 2008, the net finance income on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, representing the surplus of expected income on scheme assets over the unwind of the discount on their liabilities, was classified as investment income in the consolidated income statement.
Since adoption of IFRS in 2004, this figure had always been in a net finance income position but movements in scheme deficits and interest rates resulted in a net finance charge in 2009.
For consistency with prior years, this net charge was included within investment income in the Groups 2009 financial statements.
In 2010, there is again a net finance charge which we believe should more appropriately be included within finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
For consistency and comparability, we have therefore reclassified the 2009 comparative 183 million from net investment income to finance costs.
b Reclassification within the statement of cash flows As described in accounting policy A, the Group has adopted the revised versions of IFRS 3, Business Combinations, and IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, and consequential amendments to several other accounting standards, in its financial reporting for the current accounting period.
One such amendment to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows, requires cash flows arising from changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary, which do not result in a loss of control, to be classified as cash flows from financing activities, in the same way as other transactions with equity holders.
The Groups partial disposal of Delta Lloyd through its Initial Public Offering in 2009 gave rise to net cash proceeds of 930 million, which was disclosed as arising from investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows last year.
As a result of the amendment to IAS 7 described above, we have reclassified that amount from investing activities to financing activities in the 2009 comparatives to this years statement.
This resulted in a change in net cash from investing activities from 498 million inflow to 432 million outflow, and from financing activities from 1,501 million outflow to 571 million outflow.
