Earnings per share Basic earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 31 December 2010 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 14,038,000 2009: 3,490,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2010 of 132,664,656 2009: 124,179,686, calculated as follows: Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 2010 2009 000 000 Profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders 14,038 3,490 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 2010 2009 Issued ordinary shares at 1 January 133,138,968 120,994,753 Effect of own shares held 528,808 621,297 Effect of shares issued in year 54,496 3,806,230 Weighted average number of ordinary shares at 31 December 132,664,656 124,179,686 Basic earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2009 was calculated on the pre-exceptional profit after tax of 5,453,000.
Basic loss per share on exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2009 was calculated on the exceptional loss after tax of 1,963,000.
In both cases this is expressed on a per share basis using the weighted average share information disclosed above.
Diluted earnings per share The calculation of diluted earnings per share at 31 December 2010 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 14,038,000 2009: 3,490,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2010 of 132,685,679 2009: 124,203,192.
Under normal circumstances, the average number of shares is diluted in reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the period.
This dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.
However, as a loss per share cannot be reduced through dilution, this dilution adjustment has not been applied to the calculation of diluted loss per share arising from exceptional items in 2009.
This dilution adjustment has been applied to the calculation of diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and diluted earnings per share after exceptional items for 2009.
The calculation of diluted loss on exceptional items per share at 31 December 2009 was based on the exceptional loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of 1,963,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2009 of 124,179,686.
