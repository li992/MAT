Earnings per share the calculation of basic earnings per share at 18 september 2010 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 546m 2009 359m, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 788 million 2009 789 million.
the calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the employee share ownership Plan trust on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on disposal of non-current assets and sale and closure of businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles, the inventory fair value adjustment on the acquisition of Azucarera, and the associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
the diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share options and share incentives.
the diluted, weighted average number of shares is 788 million 2009 789 million.
there is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Intangible assets continued Impairment of goodwill As at 18 september 2010, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 1,350m 2009 1,291m.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows: 2010 2009 cash-generating unit cgu or group of cgus Primary reporting segment m m Ach Grocery 248 231 AB mauri ingredients 344 330 twinings ovaltine Grocery 119 119 capullo Grocery 58 58 illovo sugar 193 168 AB World Foods Grocery 58 58 north china sugar sugar 65 60 other various 265 267 1,350 1,291 the amount of goodwill allocated to each cGU or group of cGUs is not individually significant.
A cGU, or group of cGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
these calculations are performed annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of cGUs based on the most recent budget.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the annual budget are based on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant cGU or group of cGUs operate.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent annual budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using a range of rates based on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks of the business if necessary.
the rates used vary between 8% and 11% 2009 between 8% and 11%.
The growth rates applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that is significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill were in a range between 0% and 2.5% 2009 between 0% and 2.5%.
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region.
in these circumstances, the cash flow forecast is extended to between three and five years using specific growth assumptions.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected, and expected long-term growth rates.
each of the groups cGUs had significant headroom under the annual impairment review with the exception of the recently acquired sugar business in north east china.
current forecasts support the carrying value of the assets of the business but the achievement of these forecasts depends on significant improvements in agricultural yields and factory volumes.
management will closely monitor the value in use of these cGUs.
For all goodwill other than north china sugar, management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions, on which it has determined value in use, would cause carrying values to exceed value in use.

Employee entitlements the group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit type.
the group also operates a small number of unfunded overseas post-retirement medical benefit schemes.
UK schemes the groups principal UK defined benefit pension schemes are funded schemes and are closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements in place for other employees.
the pension costs in the UK for the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
For defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions payable.
Actuarial gains and losses arising over the financial year are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income and are reflected in the balance sheet at 18 september 2010.
Past service cost is recognised immediately in the income statement to the extent that the benefits have already vested.
the last actuarial valuation of the Associated British Foods Pension scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2008.
At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the scheme was 2,223m and represented 93% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Following completion of the actuarial valuation, the group agreed to make five annual payments of 30m in order to eliminate the deficit at 5 April 2008. the first two of these payments were made in march 2009 and march 2010. the UK government announced on 8 July 2010 that it will in future use the consumer Price index rather than the Retail Prices index for the purposes of determining statutory minimum pension increases for private sector occupational pension schemes.
the groups current UK defined benefit pension scheme rules specify that pensions in deferment will increase in line with the annual statutory order published by the UK government.
the group has therefore amended its assumption for increases to pensions in deferment to reflect this.
the resulting reduction in the present value of scheme liabilities of 28m is included as a change in assumptions within other comprehensive income.
Overseas schemes the group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in Australia and new Zealand, the United states, canada, the Republic of ireland, switzerland, Germany, France, italy, the Philippines, thailand, south Africa and Zambia.
these schemes are primarily funded schemes.
the charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified actuaries.
Unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes.
Assumptions the UK pension schemes represent 89% 2009 90% of the groups scheme assets and 88% 2009 90% of the groups scheme liabilities.
the financial assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes under iAs 19, together with the expected long-term rates of return on assets, are: 2010 2009 2008 % % % discount rate 5.2 5.7 6.0 inflation 3.5 3.5 3.7 Rate of increase in salaries 5.0 5.0 5.2 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.3 3.3 3.5 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 3.0 3.5 3.7 the mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the PA92 generational mortality tables with medium cohort improvements and an underpin improvement, as published by the institute of Actuaries.
these mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members.
examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2010 2009 life expectancy froM age 65 in years Male Female male Female member aged 65 in 2010 2009 20.9 23.1 20.8 22.7 member aged 65 in 2030 2029 22.7 25.0 22.6 24.2 the other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
the assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.

the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rate of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and with a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities, and applies to these rates suitable risk premia that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
the UK schemes net pension liability of 29m 2009 76m liability plus the overseas schemes net pension liability of 70m 2009 30m liability totals a liability of 99m 2009 106m.
this equates to the employee benefits asset of nil 2009 16m and liability of 99m 2009 122m shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.

the net cash of 249m in the acquisition table above differed from the cash flow on purchase of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement by 17m.
the difference related to amounts paid for investments in joint ventures.
the goodwill of 18m in the acquisition table above differed from the amount shown for business combinations in note 8 by 10m.
this related to the loss on disposal of the manufacturing plant in portugal, included in the disposals table in this note, which was treated as goodwill arising on the acquisition of the remaining gilde businesses.
Disposals and closure of business During 2010, the group disposed of its polish sugar business and some agricultural assets in South africa.
the group also announced the closure of its abattoir operations in Queensland, australia.
costs associated with these disposals are included within cash and deferred consideration.
the assets and liabilities of the polish sugar business were shown within assets and liabilities held for sale at 12 September 2009 see note 15.

the remaining 1m was received in respect of a reduction in stake in a joint venture.
Share-based payments the group had the following equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period: Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme this scheme was established by the company in 1994.
Under the terms of the 1994 Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the company were granted to selected qualifying employees over the ten years from November 1994. the options must be held for five years before they become exercisable.
the exercise of options is not subject to specified performance criteria.

Share-based payments continued Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme this scheme was approved and adopted by the company at the annual general meeting held on 15 December 2000.
Under the terms of the 2000 Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the company may be granted to selected employees over the ten years from 15 December 2000. the options must be held for three years before they become exercisable.
the exercise of an option under this scheme will, in accordance with institutional shareholder guidelines, be conditional on the achievement of performance criteria which are based on growth in the groups profits.
Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 the Share Incentive Plan the Share incentive plan was approved and adopted by the company at the annual general meeting held on 5 December 2003. it takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which will be released if, and to the extent that, certain performance targets are satisfied over a three-year performance period.
Further information regarding the operation of the above plans can be found on pages 46 to 49 of the remuneration report.

ordinary shares already issued and subject to option under the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme, or subject to allocation under the Share incentive plan, are held in a separate employee Share ownership plan trust.
the trust is funded by the company.
Voting rights attached to shares held by the trust are exercisable by the trustee, who is entitled to consider any recommendation made by a committee of the company.
at 18 September 2010 the trust held 3,502,583 2009 3,906,757 ordinary shares of the company.
the market value of these shares at the year end was 37m 2009 33m.

Financial instruments continued No trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents or trade and other payables are classified as held for sale at year end 2009 17m, 8m and 21m respectively.
other financial assets on the face of the balance sheet comprise other current investments and derivative assets.
other financial liabilities comprise derivative liabilities.
the methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 1. cash and cash equivalents have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities or otherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
2. other non-current investments recorded within other non-current receivables comprise minority shareholdings held primarily in privately owned, unquoted companies, where there is no active market available to value them.
Where the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost.
Where shareholdings are held in publicly quoted companies, bid price is used to estimate fair value.
3. the fair values of finance lease receivables and other long-term receivables have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
4. the fair values of trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities.
5. other current investments primarily comprise debt securities and time deposits, which are stated at fair value.
Fair value is based on cost for instruments similar in nature to cash and cash equivalents or on current market prices.
6. the fair value of derivatives is determined either by reference to third-party valuations usually from a bank, or by reference to readily observable market prices.
the groups derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is therefore almost always available to assist with the valuation of derivatives.
7. the fair values of trade payables, other payables and accruals have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities.
8. the fair values of all bank loans, overdrafts and debenture stock have been calculated using the present value of estimated future cash flows.
9. the fair values of finance lease creditors have been estimated by discounting expected cash flows.
10. provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
consequently, the fair value has been presented as book value.
Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet comprise other non-current investments, other current investments and derivative assets and liabilities.
the group classifies these financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the relative significance of both objective evidence and subjective judgements on the inputs used in making the fair value measurements: Level 1: financial instruments are valued using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical instruments.
An example of an item in this category is a widely traded equity instrument with a normal quoted market price.
Level 2: financial instruments are valued using techniques based on observable inputs, either directly i. e. market prices and rates or indirectly i. e. derived from market prices and rates.
this includes financial instruments valued using: quoted market prices in an active market for similar rather than identical instruments: quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active: or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
an example of an item in this category is a currency derivative, where forward exchange rates and yield curve data which are observable in the market are used to derive fair value.
Level 3: financial instruments are valued using techniques involving significant unobservable inputs.
This includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs which are not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the valuation.
it also includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments, but where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instrument being valued and the instrument for which the quoted price is being used.
given the nature of the groups use of financial instruments carried at fair value, few financial instruments are expected to be classified in this category.

Financial instruments continued d Financial risk identification and management the group is exposed to the following financial risks from its use of financial instruments: market risk: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
the groups financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business.
risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the groups activities.
the group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
the group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in a wide variety of locations around the world.
these operations expose the group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets.
trading and risk management teams have been established in the groups major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures, and, where appropriate, options.
these teams work closely with group treasury and report regularly to executive management.
treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the groups financial and commodity risks.
treasury works closely with the groups procurement teams to manage commodity risks.
treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, for the management and development of the groups businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.
the groups risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives outside its risk management framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks for speculative purposes.
e Foreign currency translation the group presents its financial statements in sterling.
as a result of its diverse worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations.
this reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
the group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings, and where they are not in sterling, these borrowings are designated as net investment hedges.
this enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
the group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement other than via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings, nor does it use derivatives to hedge its net investments in foreign operations.
the group designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of iaS 21. the effect of the designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and or the lending entity is accounted for directly within other comprehensive income.
the group has foreign currency borrowings that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations in euros and US dollars.
the value of these financial liabilities used as hedging instruments at the balance sheet date was: 2010 2009 m m euro 50 229 US dollar 300 279 350 508 the foreign exchange loss of 11m 2009 27m on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve on consolidation.
of this balance, 9m was attributable to equity shareholders and 2m to non-controlling interests 2009 27m to equity shareholders.
96 associated British Foods annual report and accounts 2010 FiNaNcial StatemeNtS NoteS FormiNg part oF the FiNaNcial StatemeNtS 25.
Financial instruments continued f Market risk market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as underlying market prices change.
the group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
these risks are known as transaction or recognised exposures and economic or forecast exposures.
i Commodity price risk commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
the group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
the use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by group treasury.
commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the groups overall pricing strategy.
Some of the groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, which are outside the scope of iaS 39, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the groups ordinary operations, and are not net settled the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
certain other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the forecast transaction is highly probable and the hedge is assessed as effective.
the group obtains hedge accounting for the majority of these contracts.
Some commodity derivatives are not eligible for treatment as own use contracts and are not contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting under iaS 39 are able to be satisfied.
this occurs typically where the group does not take physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
While such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure, formal hedge accounting may not be possible for reasons including: where the derivatives are in respect of a similar but different commodity to that being hedged: where exchange-traded derivatives are used that are not sufficiently close in all respects for example quality attributes to the business requirement: or where the exchange used is foreign to the business.
Where hedge accounting for commodity derivatives within the scope of iaS 39 is not available, the instruments are classified as held for trading and are marked to market through the income statement.
the majority of the groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
Sensitivity analysis the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the groups results and the groups equity of changes in commodity market prices as a result of entering into financial instruments including derivatives.
the only financial assets and liabilities expected to show any sensitivity in this respect are commodity derivatives.
the sensitivity chosen is a 20% increase in the forward curves for various commodity prices as if it had occurred on 18 September 2010.
For as long as the group continues to make limited use of options, a 20% decrease in forward prices would produce a broadly equal and opposite impact on profit and equity to that shown.
the movement of forward price curves by 20% is considered to be a reasonable approximation of how much markets might typically move, on average, over any given year, notwithstanding that the increases in some commodity prices in recent years have been significantly greater than this.
the sensitivity analysis addresses the impact on year end financial assets and liabilities, and is not an estimate of what profit might have been if commodity prices had been uniformly different throughout the year.
the following assumptions have been applied in the calculation of these sensitivities, which are presented before taxation and minority interests: all qualifying cash flow hedges at 18 September 2010 will continue to be fully effective in achieving cash flow hedge accounting: and commodity contracts that qualify for the own use treatment continue to do so.
This sensitivity therefore has no impact for these contracts.
2010 2009 impact on 2010 impact on 2009 profit for impact on profit for impact on the year total equity the year total equity - m - m - m - m 20% increase in commodity prices 7 1 8 ii Interest rate risk interest rate risk comprises two primary elements: interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates.
Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments: and interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates.
Changes in floating interest rates affect cash flows on interest receivable or payable.
the groups policy is to maintain floating rate debt for a significant proportion of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk and interest rate swaps are sometimes entered into in more volatile markets.
associated British Foods annual report and accounts 2010 97 F iNaNcial StatemeNtS NoteS FormiNg part oF the FiNaNcial StatemeNtS N otes forming part of the financial statements continued for the 53 weeks ended 18 September 2010 25.
Financial instruments continued at 18 September 2010, 600m 52% 2009 592m and 43% of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest.
the groups fixed rate debt includes the US private 3 placement loan of 397m 2009 378m and the 150m 10 4% secured redeemable debenture stock 2013 2009 150m.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months, by reference to official market rates e. g. liBor.
Sensitivity analysis applying a 100 basis point parallel increase in the interest rate yield curve as if it had occurred on 18 September 2010 results in no impact on profit for the year or total equity 2009 no impact on profit or total equity.
the following assumptions have been applied in the calculation of this sensitivity, which is presented before taxation and minority interests: the impact of this sensitivity has only been recorded for changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which have their fair value gains and losses recorded within the financial statements, assets available for sale and other current investments, as the group does not designate any other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and these are the only significant financial instruments whose carrying amounts change as a result of changes in interest rates.
all other financial instruments are carried at amortised cost: no impact is recorded in respect of changes in interest rates on employee benefits including pensions, or discount rates applied to financial instruments to record them at present value: and all qualifying cash flow hedges at 18 September 2010 will continue to be fully effective in achieving cash flow hedge accounting.
a second sensitivity analysis calculates the impact on profitability of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on floating rate loans and overdrafts, and on cash and cash equivalents balances on which variable rates of interest are earned.
the year end cash balance is deducted from the year end floating rate loans and overdrafts balance.
the resultant net floating rate borrowing figure is multiplied by 1%.
in 2010, this equated to an interest expense of 2m before taxation and non-controlling interests 2009 4m.
iii Foreign currency risk the group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies.
as a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the groups transaction costs.
the group also publishes its financial statements in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
translation risk is discussed in section e above.
Transaction risk currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
it also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas.
the groups policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.
all foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance.
identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business.
the group uses derivatives principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
the group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction hedges.
instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement.
this offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
Economic forecast risk the group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12 month basis.
the group does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
the group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
to the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
the majority of the groups currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
the groups most significant currency transaction exposures are: sugar prices in British Sugar UK to movements in the sterling euro exchange rate: sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand US dollar euro exchange rates: and sourcing for Primark costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies primarily US dollars and euros, giving rise to transaction exposures.
in all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies and, as a result, further transaction exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements is modest.

the analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on businesses financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses.
a similar but opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the groups main operating currencies weakened against local functional currencies by a similar amount.
the following assumption has been applied in the calculation of this sensitivity, which is presented before taxation and non-controlling interests: the exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the translation reserve in equity see below for a separate sensitivity.

Financial instruments continued g Credit risk credit risk is the risk that counterparties to financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract or instrument.
the groups businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
the immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 18 September 2010. the group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: 2010 2009 m m cash and cash equivalents 345 391 loans and receivables refer to note 25a 1,139 1,161 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss derivative assets 7 5 Designated cash flow hedging relationships derivative assets 26 7 1,517 1,564 the majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.
as at 18 September 2010, there were no significant financial guarantees or third-party obligations that increased the credit risk of the financial assets set out above.
although the group has seen no direct evidence of changes to the credit risk of its counterparties, the current focus on financial liquidity in all international markets has introduced increased financial volatility.
the group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial profile of its counterparties.
Trade and other receivables concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the groups large and diverse customer base.
the group has established a credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced.
this includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references.
credit limits are established for all significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional approval from the appropriate level of management.
outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business.
credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually.
customers that fail to meet the groups benchmark creditworthiness may only transact with the group on a prepayment basis.
aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
many of the groups customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low.
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured claim.
the group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
the group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data.
the majority of the provision comprises specific amounts.

Financial instruments continued the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date by geographic region of origin was: 2010 2009 m m UK 315 330 europe & africa 189 251 the americas 129 141 asia pacific 315 299 948 1,021 trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2010 2009 gross gross m m Not overdue 716 638 Up to 1 month past due 94 186 Between 1 and 2 months past due 20 31 Between 2 and 3 months past due 10 8 more than 3 months past due 33 31 provision for doubtful debts 38 38 at 18 September 2010 835 856 in 2009, 9m of trade receivables were classified as held for sale at year end.
Based on past experience, the group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables that are not past due.
trade and other receivables are stated net of the following provision for irrecoverable amounts: 2010 2009 m m opening balance 38 43 amounts provided for during the year 9 8 amounts released during the year 2 2 amounts utilised during the year 8 12 acquisitions 1 effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 closing balance 38 38 No trade and other receivables 2009 none were written off directly to the income statement in the year.
the directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates fair value.
Cash, cash equivalents and other current investments Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group.
these banks are selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses day-to-day banking requirements.
the credit ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis.
in locations where the core relationship banking group cannot be used, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group treasury.
the group has not recorded impairments against cash, cash equivalents or other current investments, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances.
Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.
Other financial assets other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date.
No impairment issues have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss for those not in a designated cash flow hedging relationship, or otherwise through the hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified.

Financial instruments continued h Liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
group treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient headroom in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements.
the group also has access to uncommitted facilities to assist with short-term funding requirements.
available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least quarterly, or more often, as required.
actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated and explained.
particular focus is given to management of working capital.
Details of the groups borrowing facilities are given in section i. the following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities at the balance sheet date and compares them to carrying amounts: 2010 Due between Due within 6 months Due between Due between Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m non-derivative financial liabilities trade and other payables 19 1,240 44 1,284 1,284 Secured redeemable debenture stock 18 5 8 16 166 195 150 Secured bank loans 18 38 33 52 21 144 140 Unsecured bank loans and overdrafts 18 253 61 56 406 242 1,018 859 Finance leases 26 1 1 2 40 44 12 provisions 20 51 48 17 90 14 220 205 derivative financial liabilities currency derivatives net payments 28 4 32 29 commodity derivatives net payments 4 6 2 9 total financial liabilities 1,620 192 142 685 296 2,935 2,688 2009 Due between Due within 6 months Due between Due between Due after contracted carrying 6 months and 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m non-derivative financial liabilities trade and other payables 19 1,224 24 1,248 1,248 Secured redeemable debenture stock 18 8 8 16 182 214 150 Secured bank loans 18 24 25 63 42 154 144 Unsecured bank loans and overdrafts 18 503 62 37 345 314 1,261 1,083 Finance leases 26 1 1 2 41 45 13 provisions 20 198 50 33 108 52 441 421 derivative financial liabilities currency derivatives net payments 95 9 104 56 commodity derivatives net payments 23 50 1 72 19 interest rate derivatives net payments 1 1 1 total financial liabilities 2,031 128 151 679 407 3,396 3,135 the above tables do not include forecast data for liabilities which may be incurred in the future but which were not contracted at 18 September 2010. the principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments on the secured redeemable debenture stock and other fixed rate debt to which the group is already committed, future interest payments on the groups finance leases, and cash flows on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value.

Accounting estimates and judgements Key sources of estimation uncertainty in applying the accounting policies detailed on pages 61 to 67, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Forecasts and discount rates the carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on estimates of future cash flows arising from the groups operations which, in some circumstances, are discounted to arrive at a net present value: the carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually and also when there is an indication that it may be impaired.
This assessment involves comparing the book value of goodwill with its recoverable amount being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is determined with reference to projected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate.
Both the projected future cash flows and the discount rate applied involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty: and the realisation of deferred tax assets recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise.
the group recognises deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered, based on an assessment of the likelihood of there being sufficient taxable profits in the future.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Post-retirement benefits the groups defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with iaS 19. the accounting valuation, which has been assessed using assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net liability of 99m being recognised as at 18 September 2010. the size of this net liability is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes, to the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, to the actuarial assumptions which include price inflation, rates of pension and salary increases, mortality and other demographic assumptions and to the level of contributions.
Further details are included in note 12.
Provisions as described in the accounting policies on pages 61 to 67, provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
these estimates are made taking into account a range of possible outcomes.

Accounting estimates and judgements continued Property, plant and equipment residual values and useful lives these assets are written down to their estimated residual values over their anticipated useful lives using the straight-line basis.
management reviews residual values annually considering market conditions and projected disposal values.
in assessing useful lives, maintenance programmes and technological innovations are considered.
the carrying value of property, plant and equipment is disclosed in note 9.
Biological assets cane roots valuation the escalated average cost, using appropriate inflation-related indices, of each year of planting adjusted for the remaining expected life.
this requires an estimation by management of the average number of ratoons expected from the crop.
the carrying value of cane roots is disclosed in note 10. growing cane valuation growing cane is valued using the estimated sucrose content at the estimated sucrose price for the following season, less the estimated costs for harvesting and transport.
the estimated sucrose content requires management to assess the expected cane and sucrose yields for the following season considering weather conditions and harvesting programmes.
in assessing the estimated sucrose price, management is required to assess into which markets the forthcoming crop will be sold and assess domestic and export prices as well as the related foreign currency exchange rates.
the carrying value of growing cane is disclosed in note 10.
Cash flow hedge accounting the group enters into various types of hedging or forward contracts for the buying and selling of currencies and commodities.
the contracts often fall within the scope of iaS 39 and accordingly have to be marked to market.
Where appropriate, these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges which, to the extent the hedges are effective, results in the change in value of the derivative being deferred in the hedging reserve.
in order to achieve and maintain cash flow hedge accounting, it is necessary for the group to determine, at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether a forecast transaction is highly probable and whether the hedge is effective.
this requires both subjective and objective measures of determination.
Exceptional items the directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their nature and amount should be disclosed separately if the financial statements are to present fairly the financial position and financial performance of the entity.
the directors label these items collectively as exceptional items.
Determining which transactions are to be considered exceptional in nature is often a subjective matter.
however, circumstances that the directors believe would give rise to exceptional items for separate disclosure might include major business restructurings, impairments and reversals of impairments.
all exceptional items are included in the appropriate income statement line item to which they relate.
in addition, for clarity, separate disclosure is made of all exceptional items, with additional explanation in the notes.
Taxation the income tax expense recorded in the income statement is dependent on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted during the period, together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
the level of current and deferred tax recognised is also dependent on subjective judgements as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the group operates.
it is necessary to consider the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised based on an assessment of the extent to which they are regarded as recoverable.
Fair values on acquisition the group is required to bring acquired assets and liabilities on to the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value.
items of plant and equipment and the associated property interests often have long operating lives, hence determination of the fair values can require a significant degree of judgement.
acquisitions often also result in significant intangible benefits being brought into the group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets.
other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of accounting standards and therefore form part of goodwill.
Significant judgement can be required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, often with reference to internal data and models.
professional valuers are engaged where it is deemed appropriate to do so.
Fair values on major acquisitions are disclosed in note 22. associated British Foods annual report and accounts 2010 109
