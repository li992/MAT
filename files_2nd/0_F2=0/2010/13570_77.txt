Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A these primarily comprise floating rate convertible loan stock.
the conversion conditions are such that fair value approximates to the book value.
B Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
c Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
these financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices level 2 as defined by iFRs 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
D Borrowing and financial RRsps are carried at amortised cost.
Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
For financial RRsps, the contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest forecasts.

the group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities jet fuel and base metals.
the group does not include foreign exchange or commodity financial instruments in any cash flow hedging relationships for accounting purposes.
to hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in us dollars, the group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges.

these financial liabilities are valued at each reporting date using the amortised cost method.

Risk management policies and hedging activities the principal financial risks to which the group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: liquidity risk: credit risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
the Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk the group has significant cash flows most significantly us dollars, followed by the euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
to manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
the group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
to manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
the group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
the group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
113 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2010 Financial statements Governance Business review Notes to the CoNsolidated FiNaNCial statemeNts CoNtiNued 16 FinAnciAl instRuments continueD liquidity risk the groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
the group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the group to manage its liquidity risk.
the profile of the maturity of the groups committed facilities is shown in the Finance Directors review.
credit risk the group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
the effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the groups risk management activities.
the group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the group credit policy.
the objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the groups exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the group transacts strictly with BBB or higher rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties.
the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
interest rate risk the groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk, floating rate borrowings, cash and cash equivalents cash flow risk.
interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile within the group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position.
these are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
commodity risk the group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
to minimise its cash flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the group enters into derivative commodity transactions.
other price risk the groups cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to three months.
the group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.

the most significant transactional currency exposures are us dollar with sterling and us dollar with euro.
At December 31, 2010 if sterling had weakened ten per cent against the us dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 989m lower 2009 864m.
if sterling had strengthened ten per cent against the us dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 809m higher 2009 707m.
there would have been no change to the underlying results that exclude unrealised gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives.
At December 31, 2010 if the euro had weakened ten per cent against the us dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax and equity for the year would have been 82m lower 2009 88m.
if the euro had strengthened ten per cent against the us dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 66m higher 2009 72m.
At December 31, 2010 if the price of commodities had been ten per cent lower, with all other variables remaining constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 11m lower 2009 11m, arising mainly as the result of lower fair value gains on derivative contracts.
if the price of commodities had been ten per cent higher, with all other variables remaining constant, profit after tax and equity would have been 11m higher 2009 11m, arising mainly as the result of higher fair value gains on derivative contracts.
there would have been no change to the underlying results that exclude unrealised gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
At December 31, 2010 the group had no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates on that date.
the main interest rate sensitivity for the group arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies on page 52.
C Shares and payments to shareholders the company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares c shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
c shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year.
shareholders are able to redeem any number of their c shares for cash.
Any c shares retained attract a dividend of 75 per cent of liBoR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights.
in certain circumstances the company has the option to compulsorily redeem the c shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of c shares in issue is less than ten per cent of the aggregate number of c shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the company.
movements in the c shares during the year were as follows: 2010 2009 Nominal value nominal value Millions m millions m Issued and fully paid At January 1 12,577 13 issued to equity shareholders 278,115 278 263,776 264 Redeemed 267,312 267 251,199 251 At December 31 23,380 23 12,577 13 payments to shareholders in respect of the year represent the value of c shares to be issued in respect of the results for the year.
