SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2010 90 Notes to the accounts 30 Risk therefore bevery difficult to remove a general partner or manager of a fund in which the Company invests such that the Company may potentially find itself locked into an under-performing fund.
The fund documentation relating to Permira IV contains no provision for the removal of the general partner ormanager by vote of the limited partners save in circumstances involving severe culpability.
Even if those circumstances were to arise, which the Company considers to be unlikely, the consent of a special majority of limited partners would be required which the Company is unlikely to be able toprocure on its own.
Once the Company has made a capital commitment to a fund, it may be difficult to terminate its participation or reduce its capital commitment even if the investment returns arising from that fund are poor or not competitive.
Regulatory risks The regulatory environment in which the Group operates is increasingly complex and the Group faces a number of regulatory risks.
Breaches of regulations such as the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules could lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and damage the Groups reputation.
Breaches of controls by service providers could also lead to reputational damage or loss.
Key regulatory risks have been identified and appropriate monitoring of such risks is undertaken regularly on behalf of the Board.
Three of the Companys subsidiaries: SVG Advisers Limited, SVG Investment Managers Limited and SVG Managers Limited are authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority.
Certain other subsidiaries are regulated by foreign regulators.
There are a number of legislative initiatives to increase regulation of the alternative investments sector including private equity.
Such legislation has not been finalised, however there is a risk that such legislation, when enacted, could materially affect the business of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Risk of warehousing assets The Company has, in the past, occasionally made commitments to fund investments in order to seed a prospective SVG Advisers product and then warehoused the investments on the balance sheet until the product was launched.
In difficult fund raising environments, there is a risk that no new funds will be raised in the future into which these commitments can be transferred.
The Company will therefore then either have to sell these investments or hold them on its balance sheet.
However, these assets are currently fide minimis for the Group.
Taxation risk Any change in the taxation legislation or practice could affect the value of the Groups investments and as a result, its performance.
A breach of Section 1158 of the United Kingdom Corporation Tax Act 2010 could result in the Group being subject to corporation tax on realised gains on the sale of portfolio investments which would have a material adverse effect on the net returns earned by SVG Capital.
However, the Group has strict controls in place to ensure that it complies with the requirements of Section 1158 and contracts with specialist tax advisers to provide advice on changes to tax regulation and practice.
However, there can be no guarantee in advance that the Company will satisfy the conditions for approval by HMRC as an investment trust under Section 1158 or that the Company will not become a close company, which would result in its being unable to qualify as an investment trust for tax purposes.
The Company has agreed allocation arrangements within the documentation of Permira Funds in order to assist in compliance with the conditions for approval by HMRC as an investment trust under Section 1158.
There can be no guarantee or assurance however that such arrangements will be secured for future investments.
Any failure to do so will increase the risk of a breach of Section 1158.
