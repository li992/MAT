Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, as described on pages 34 to 39, BP has incurred costs during the year and has recognized liabilities for future costs.
Liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and contingent liabilities have been accounted for and or disclosed in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
These are discussed in further detail in Note 37 for provisions and Note 44 for contingent liabilities.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the $20-billion trust fund which was established during the year have been accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 5 Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds.
Key aspects of the accounting for the oil spill are summarized below.
The financial impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the group are shown in the table below.
Amounts related to the trust fund are separately identified.

In 2010 BP contributed $5 billion to the fund, and further quarterly contributions of $1.25 billion are to be made during 2011 to 2013.
The income statement charge for 2010 includes $20 billion in relation to the trust fund, adjusted to take account of the time value of money.
Fines, penalties and claims administration costs are not covered by the trust fund.
The establishment of the trust fund does not represent a cap or floor on BPs liabilities and BP does not admit to a liability of this amount.
Under the terms of the Trust agreement, BP has no right to access the funds once they have been contributed to the trust fund and BP has no decision-making role in connection with the payment by the trust fund of individual and business claims resolved by the GCCF.
BP will receive funds from the trust fund only upon its expiration, if there are any funds remaining at that point.
BP has the authority under the Trust agreement to present certain resolved claims, including natural resource damages claims and state and local response claims, to the Trust for payment, by providing the trustees with all the required documents establishing that such claims are valid under the Trust agreement.
However, any such payments can only be made on the authority of the Trustee and any funds distributed are paid directly to the claimants, not to BP.
BP will not settle any such items directly or receive reimbursement from the trust fund for such items.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued BPs obligation to make contributions to the trust fund was recognized in full, amounting to $20 billion on an undiscounted basis as it is committed to making these contributions.
On initial recognition the discounted amount recognized was $19,580 million.
After BPs contributions of $5 billion to the trust fund during 2010, and adjustments for discounting, the remaining liability as at 31 December 2010 was $14,901 million.
This liability is recorded within other payables on the balance sheet, apportioned between current and non-current elements according to the agreed schedule of contributions.
The table below shows movements in the funding obligation, recognized within other payables on the balance sheet, during the period to 31 December 2010.

This is the portion of the estimated future expenditure provided for that will be settled by payments from the trust fund.
We use the term reimbursement asset to describe this asset.
BP will not actually receive any reimbursements from the trust fund, instead payments will be made directly to claimants from the trust fund, and BP will be released from its corresponding obligation.
The portion of the provision recognized during the year for items that will be covered by the trust fund was $12,567 million.
Of this amount, payments of $3,023 million were made during the year from the trust fund.
The remaining reimbursement asset as at 31 December 2010 was $9,544 million and is recorded within other receivables on the balance sheet.
The amount of the reimbursement asset is equal to the amount of provisions as at 31 December 2010 that will be covered by the trust fund see Note 37 in the table under Provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Movements in the reimbursement asset are presented in the table below: $ million Increase in provision for items covered by the trust fund 12,567 Amounts paid directly by the trust fund 3,023 At 31 December 2010 9,544 Of which current 5,943 non-current 3,601 The amount of the income statement charge related to the trust fund comprises: $ million Trust fund liability discounted 19,580 Change in discount rate relating to trust fund liability 240 Recognition of reimbursement asset 12,567 Other 8 Total charge relating to the trust fund 7,261 As noted above, the obligation to fund the $20-billion trust fund has been recognized in full.
Any increases in the provision that will be covered by the trust fund up to the amount of $20 billion have no net income statement effect as a reimbursement asset is also recognized, as described above.
These charges for provisions, and the associated reimbursement asset, recognized during the year amounted to $12,567 million.
Thus, a further $7,433 million could be provided in subsequent periods for items covered by the trust fund with no net impact on the income statement.
Such future increases in amounts provided could arise from adjustments to existing provisions, or from the initial recognition of provisions for items that currently cannot be estimated reliably, namely final judgments and settlements and natural resource damages and related costs.
It is not possible at this time to conclude as to whether the $20-billion fund will be sufficient to satisfy all claims under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 that will ultimately be paid.
Further information on those items that currently cannot be reliably estimated is provided under Provisions and contingencies and in Note 44.
The Trust agreement does not require BP to make further contributions to the trust fund in excess of the agreed $20 billion should this be insufficient to cover all claims administered by the GCCF, or to settle other items that are covered by the trust fund, as described above.
Should the $20-billion trust fund not be sufficient, BP would commence settling legitimate claims and other costs by making payments directly to claimants.
In this case, increases in estimated future expenditure above $20 billion would be recognized as provisions with a corresponding charge in the income statement.
The provisions would be utilized and derecognized at the point that BP made the payments.
On 30 September 2010, BP pledged certain Gulf of Mexico assets as collateral for the trust fund funding obligation.
The pledged collateral consists of an overriding royalty interest in oil and gas production of BPs Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Mad Dog, Great White and Mars, Ursa and Na Kika assets in the Gulf of Mexico.
A wholly-owned company called Verano Collateral Holdings LLC Verano has been created to hold the overriding royalty interest, which is capped at $1.25 billion per quarter and $17 billion in total.
Verano has pledged the overriding royalty interest to the Trust as collateral for BPs remaining contribution obligations to the Trust.
BP contributed a further $2 billion to the trust fund since this arrangement was established, thereby reducing the amount of the pledge to $15 billion at the end of the year.
There is no change in operatorship or the marketing of the production from the assets and there is no effect on the other partners interests in the assets.
For financial reporting purposes Verano is a consolidated entity of BP and there is no impact on the consolidated financial statements from the pledge of the overriding royalty interest.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued Provisions and contingencies At 31 December 2010 BP has recorded certain provisions and disclosed certain contingencies as a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
These are described below under Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Other items.
Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 The claims against BP under the OPA 90 and for personal injury fall into three categories: i claims by individuals and businesses for removal costs, damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity, loss of subsistence use of natural resources and for personal injury Individual and Business Claims : ii claims by state and local government entities for removal costs, physical damage to real or personal property, loss of government revenue and increased public services costs State and Local Claims : and iii claims by the United States, a State trustee, an Indian tribe trustee, or a foreign trustee for natural resource damages Natural Resource Damages claims.
In addition, BP faces civil litigation in which claims for liability under OPA 90 along with other causes of actions, including personal injury claims, are asserted by individuals, businesses and government entities.
A provision has been recorded for Individual and Business Claims and State and Local Claims.
A provision has also been recorded for claims administration costs and natural resource damage assessment costs.
BP considers that it is not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to Natural Resource Damages claims under OPA 90 or litigation for violations of OPA 90.
These items are therefore disclosed as contingent liabilities.
The $20-billion trust fund described above is available to satisfy the OPA 90 claims and litigation referred to above with the exception of claims administration costs which are borne separately by BP.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the trust fund have been recognized and $20 billion, adjusted to take account of the time value of money, was charged to the income statement.
The establishment of the trust fund does not represent a cap or floor on BPs liabilities and BP does not admit liability for this amount.
Other items Provisions at 31 December 2010 also include amounts in relation to offshore and onshore oil spill response, BPs commitment to a 10-year research programme in the Gulf of Mexico, estimated penalties for liability under Clean Water Act Section 311 and legal fees where we have been able to estimate reliably those which will arise in the next two years.
These are not covered by the trust fund.
The provision does not reflect any amounts in relation to fines and penalties except for those relating to the Clean Water Act, as it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amount or timing of such additional items.
BP also considers that it is not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to litigation or any obligation in relation to legal fees beyond two years.
No amounts have been recognized for recovery of costs from our co-owners of the Macondo well because under IFRS recovery must be virtually certain for receivables to be recognized.
All of these items are therefore disclosed as contingent assets.
Further information on provisions is provided below and in Note 37.
Further information on contingent liabilities and contingent assets is provided in Note 44.
A provision has been recognized for estimated future expenditure relating to the oil spill, for items that can be reliably measured at this time, in accordance with BPs accounting policy for provisions, as set out in Note 1.
The total amount recognized as a provision during the year was $30,261 million including $12,567 million for items covered by the trust fund and $17,694 million for other items.
After deducting amounts utilized during the year totalling $13,935 million including payments from the trust fund of $3,023 million and payments made directly by BP of $10,912 million, and after adjustments for discounting, the remaining provision as at 31 December 2010 was $16,335 million.
Movements in the provision are presented in the table below.
$ million Increase in provision items not covered by the trust fund 17,694 items covered by the trust fund 12,567 Unwinding of discount 4 Change in discount rate 5 Utilization paid by BP 10,912 paid by the trust fund 3,023 At 31 December 2010 16,335 Of which current 7,938 non-current 8,397 The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors.
Furthermore, the amount of claims that become payable by BP, the amount of fines ultimately levied on BP including any determination of BPs negligence, the outcome of litigation, and any costs arising from any longer-term environmental consequences of the oil spill, will also impact upon the ultimate cost for BP.
Although the provision recognized is the current best reliable estimate of expenditures required to settle certain present obligations at the end of the reporting period, there are future expenditures for which it is not possible to measure the obligation reliably as noted above.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued Impact upon the group income statement and cash flow statement The group income statement for 2010 includes a pre-tax charge of $40,935 million in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
This comprises costs incurred up to 31 December 2010, estimated obligations for future costs that can be estimated reliably at this time and rights and obligations relating to the trust fund.
Finance costs of $77 million reflect the unwinding of discount on the trust fund liability and provisions.
The amount of the provision recognized during the year can be reconciled to the income statement charge as follows: $ million Increase in provision 30,261 Change in discount rate relating to provisions 5 Costs charged directly to the income statement 3,339 Trust fund liability discounted 19,580 Change in discount rate relating to trust fund liability 240 Recognition of reimbursement asset 12,567 Profit loss before interest and taxation 40,858 Costs charged directly to the income statement relate to expenditure incurred prior to the establishment of a provision at the end of the second quarter and ongoing operating costs of the GCRO.
The accounting associated with the recognition of the trust fund liability and the expenditure which will be settled from the trust fund is described above.
The total charge in the income statement is analysed in the table below.
Costs charged directly to the income statement in relation to spill response, environmental and litigation and claims are those that arose prior to recording a provision at the end of the second quarter of the year.

Response operations following the Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010 have been managed by the federal governments response framework, which transitioned on 17 December from the Unified Area Command UAC to the Gulf Coast incident management team GC-IMT.
Both the UAC and now the GC-IMT link the organizations responding to the incident and provide a forum for those organizations to make consensus decisions.
If consensus cannot be reached the US Coast Guard co-ordinator carries the final decision on response related actions deemed necessary.
As such, the activities undertaken by BP and its sub-contractors, and the associated costs, are not wholly within BPs control.
This will continue to be the case until control of the response operations transitions to the Gulf Coast Restoration Organization.
In particular, the centralized approval process established for the procurement of materials, equipment and personnel has not been used for all of the procurement activity that has taken place.
The types of activity that fell outside the centralized approval process included aspects of the surface and shoreline response.
Numerous personnel and vessels were involved in activities which included skimming, boom deployment and shoreline clean up.
Due to the scale of the incident and the need to respond rapidly, procurement authority was vested with state on-scene co-ordinators, various responsible parties and various state and local government authorities.
So long as the expenses incurred are found to be consistent with the National Contingency Plan, the responsible parties will be expected to pay these costs, regardless of whether or not they were involved in or approved the decision to procure the resource.
With the large number of parties involved, the resulting funding flows are complex and resulted in difficulty maintaining real time monitoring of expenses.
Pre-tax cash flows amounted to $17,658 million and the impact on net cash provided by operating activities, on a post-tax basis, amounted to $16,019 million.
