Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24. pensions The group principal pension scheme, the Britvic Pension Plan BPP, has both a defined benefit and a defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section of the BPP was closed to new members on 1 August 2002, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join the defined contribution section of the BPP.
Contributions are paid into the Plan in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary and as outlined in the Schedule of Contributions.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2007 under the Scheme Specific Requirements, with a further valuation carried out at 31 March 2010 currently being finalised.
As a result of the latest formal valuation, an annual contribution of 10.0m in respect of the funding shortfall outlined in the Recovery Plan will be made by 31 December 2010.
These arrangements will be reviewed with the Trustee after the 31 March 2010 valuation is completed.
In September 2010, the group announced that it was entering into consultation with GB employees about a proposal to close the defined benefit section of the BPP to future accrual for active members with effect from 10 April 2011.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP defined contribution scheme in the income statement for 2010 was 3.6m 2009: 2.9m.
In Northern Ireland, the Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan BNIPP was closed to new members on 28 February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General.
Employees of C&C Group transferred out of BNIPP on 30 June 2008 with the bulk transfer of assets for the C&C employees taking place in December 2009.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 December 2008 and as a result shortfall correction additional contributions of 90,000 per month until 31 December 2010, and 125,000 per month from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2019 are being paid in accordance with the Recovery Plan dated December 2009.
In the Republic of Ireland, employees continued to participate in a number of C&C Group pension schemes following the acquisition until transferring into two newly formed pension plans called the Britvic Ireland Defined Contribution Pension Plan and the Britvic Ireland Defined Benefit Pension Plan BIPP on 1 September 2008.
Both Plans are held under trust and operated by Britvic Ireland Pension Trust Limited as trustee.
Since 1 March 2006 new employees have been offered membership of the defined contribution plan in the first instance, with the ability to transfer into the defined benefit plan for future service benefits after a period of 5 years.
The company continues to pay instalments of 200,000 for each monthly pay period, in addition to normal on-going contributions, relating to the supplementary cost of the reorganisation programme that took place at the end of 2008.
The first formal actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 December 2009 and is still being finalised.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish defined contribution schemes in the Income Statement for 2010 was 0.4m 2009: 0.3m.
All group pension schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the groups finances.
The assets and liabilities of the pension schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 3 October 2010 by Towers Watson BPP and Mercer BIPP and BNIPP.
Included within the pension liability on the consolidated balance sheet is an accrual of 1.1m for retirement indemnities in respect of Britvic France.
This liability is considered to be immaterial and no further disclosure is included within this note.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate on assets assumption for the portfolio.
demographic assumptions The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables known as PA92.
An allowance for future improvements in longevity has also been included.
The following life expectancy assumptions have been used: 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 Years Years Years Years Years Years ROI NI GB ROI NI GB Current pensioners at age 65 males 22.7 20.9 21.9 20.7 20.8 20.0 Current pensioners at age 65 females 24.4 23.7 24.2 23.8 23.6 23.0 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 males 25.6 22.6 24.1 21.8 22.6 21.2 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 females 26.7 25.1 26.6 24.8 25.1 24.0 The mortality assumptions used to calculate the GB pension obligation were revised in 2010 following a mortality analysis carried out as part of the ongoing actuarial valuation of the Britvic Pension Plan at 31 March 2010.

Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.

The pension curtailments in the year were triggered by the redundancies of employees resulting in a significant number of members moving from active to deferred status in the period.
These employees no longer accrue future entitlement, which gave rise to the curtailment gain.
