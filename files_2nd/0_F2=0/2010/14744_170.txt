The company was created specifically to develop the Greater Gabbard Offshore wind farm in the outer Thames Estuary.
On 14 May 2008, Airtricity Holdings acquired the remaining 50% equity shareholding in Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited GGOWL from Fluor International Limited for cash consideration of 40.0m, increasing its stake from 50% to 100%.
Subsequently, on 3 November 2008, Airtricity Holdings sold 50% of its equity shareholding in GGOWL to RWE Npower Renewables Limited, the UK fully owned subsidiary of RWE Innogy GmbH.
The total proceeds on disposal was 308.5m, which comprised 165.6m reimbursement of 50% of the capital costs already incurred in developing the project and 142.9m in relation to the 50% of the equity.
The gain on sale recognised was 102.7m, which has been disclosed separately in the income statement as an exceptional item.
Scottish and Southern Energy 1 1 6 Annual Report 2010 Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 15.
ACquiSiTiONS AND DiSPOSALS continued The transactions can be summarised thus: Acquisition of 50% on 14 May 2008: Book value of Fair value 50% acquired acquired m m Goodwill 9.4 Development assets 6.6 40.0 Loans 6.6 6.6 Deferred tax 9.4 Net assets 33.4 Consideration paid being: Cash 40.0 Loans assumed 6.6 33.4 On acquisition of the second 50%, the wholly owned GGOWL entity was fully consolidated as a subsidiary in the Group.
The fair values previously attributed to jointly controlled entities established on acquisition of Airtricity Holdings were consequently transferred to development assets.
The project achieved consent in the period between full consolidation and part-disposal and as a result the expenditure incurred at the point of Board approval was transferred from development assets to property, plant and equipment, including the previously mentioned fair values.
Consequently, at the point of disposal, a higher project book value in relation to property, plant and equipment had been recorded than the proceeds reimbursed by RWE Innogy.
This can be summarised thus: Disposal of 50% on 3 November 2008: Book value m Property, plant and equipment 397.4 Goodwill 17.4 Loans 331.2 Deferred tax 9.4 Net assets 74.2 50% of value of business disposed of: 37.1 Consideration paid for 50% being: Cash received by Group 308.5 Less: contribution to loans 165.6 Less: costs of disposal 3.1 Net proceeds of disposal 139.8 Gain on disposal 102.7 ii Other acquisitions In the previous year, the Group also acquired the following companies, all of which are involved in the construction and development of wind farms, with the fair value substantially relating their development potential.
