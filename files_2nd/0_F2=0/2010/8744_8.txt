Under the impairment review, each CGU is reviewed for its recoverable amount, determined as being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
This resulted in an impairment charge of 10,557,000.
During the previous year, included within the 15,951,000 charge in respect of impairment of property and fixed assets was a charge of 6,527,000, relating to the impairment review of the Companys assets, and 9,424,000, relating to a one-off depreciation adjustment.
Property-related disposals and write-offs in the previous year relate to one non-trading unit which was disposed of and three additional non-trading units which management decided to sell, resulting in a charge to the income statement arising from the reduction of their book value to their fair value.
Also included are aborted property costs on several sites which management decided not to pursue.
This resulted in a charge of 4,404,000.
Litigation costs of 1,565,000 in the previous year related to legal action against the Companys former estate agents, Van fide Berg.

2 Act 2010 was substantially enacted before the balance sheet date of 25 July 2010.
It included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
The lower rate of 27% has been used to determine the overall net deferred tax liability.
The June 2010 budget also announced the intention to reduce further the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
These further proposed rate reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are not, therefore, included in the financial statements.
The proposed reductions in the rate are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The impact of the further changes in rate, from 27% to 24%, would be a 6.4m increase in profits for the year.
The overall effect of the changes applied to the deferred tax balances at 25 July 2010 would be to increase profits for the year by 8.3m being 2.8m recognised in July 2011, 2.8m in July 2012 and 2.7m in July 2013 and increase other comprehensive losses by 1.9m being 0.7m recognised in July 2011, 0.6m in July 2012 and 0.6m in July 2013.

The board also declared a special dividend of 7.0p.
Both of these were paid on 1 April 2010.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Company estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, based on the expected future trading performance anticipated by management.
There is a significant number of interconnected assumptions which underpin the value-in-use calculations.
However, the underlying basis for the impairment model involves each CGUs projected cash flow for the financial year ending 24 July 2011, extrapolated to incorporate individual assumptions, in respect of sales growth, gross margin and cost-savings for that specific CGU.
In establishing the value of the CGUs future cash flows, the board has approved a set of overall projections which it considers to be prudent.
The pre-tax discount rate employed by the Company this year was 10.0% 2009: 10.0%.
The board approved the discount rate, considering it to be prudent, yet reflective of the current economic climate.
As a result of this exercise, impairment losses in 2010 were 10,557,000 2009: 6,527,000.
9,441,000 of this impairment charge relates to property, plant and equipment, as reflected in the preceding table, while 1,117,000 relates to other non-current assets, as described in note 13.
Management believes that a reasonable change in any of the key assumptions, for example the discount rate applied to each CGU, could cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount, but that the change would be immaterial.
During the previous year, a review of the fixed-asset register was undertaken.
As a result, a one-off depreciation adjustment of 9,288,000 was taken in property, plant and equipment, following a review by management in respect of certain assets which were not being depreciated in line with the Companys accounting policy.
At the same time, management reclassified certain assets and certain accumulated depreciation to the correct statutory headings within property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-current assets.
Finance leases The carrying value of fixed assets held under finance leases at 25 July 2010, included within equipment, fixtures and fittings, was as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Cost 13,915 4,838 Accumulated depreciation 5,456 2,485 Net book amount 8,459 2,353 24 J D WETHERSPOON PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12 Intangible assets IT software costs 000 Cost: At 27 July 2008: 13,175 Additions 1,487 Reclassification 328 At 26 July 2009 14,334 Additions 2,653 At 25 July 2010 16,987 Amortisation At 27 July 2008 8,758 Amortisation during the period 878 Amortisation adjustment 6 Reclassification 166 At 26 July 2009 9,476 Amortisation during the period 811 At 25 July 2010 10,287 Net book amount at 25 July 2010 6,700 Net book amount at 26 July 2009 4,858 Net book amount at 27 July 2008 4,417 Amortisation of 811,000 2009: 878,000 is included in the cost of sales in the income statement.
Intangible assets include a carrying value of 2,800,000 in respect of development costs for the Companys till upgrade.
Remaining amortisation period is 10 years.
As disclosed within property, plant and equipment note 11, a review of the Companys fixed assets in the previous year resulted in a one-off depreciation adjustment of 6,000 in intangible assets.
Included within the intangible assets is 903,000 of assets under construction.

The major classes of assets held, comprising the units classified as held for sale, were as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 1,135 During the year under review, management took the decision to develop the three sites which had previously been held for sale.
One of these sites has subsequently begun trading, while the other two remain under development at 25 July 2010.
At the time of transferring these assets back into property, plant and equipment, management considered the recoverable amount of these assets and consequently reversed 683,000 worth of impairment losses previously recognised.
This decision was taken based on the actual performance of the trading site and the expected returns on the two sites which remain under development.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Effective from 27 July 2009, the Company adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments which are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level, using the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data level 3 The fair value of the interest-rate swap of 61.4m is considered to be level 2.
All other financial assets and liabilities are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
21 Other liabilities 2010 2009 000 000 Operating lease incentives 8,153 6,443 Amount held in respect of gaming machine settlement under appeal by HMRC 14,941 Other liabilities 23,094 6,443 Included in other liabilities are lease incentives on leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset.
The lease incentives are recognised as a reduction in rent paid over the lease term, resulting in deferred income recognised on the balance sheet.
The weighted average period to maturity of operating lease incentives is 16.3 years 2009: 15.8 years.
Also included is an amount held in respect of the Companys gaming machine VAT claim.
A decision was released during the period in respect of Rank plcs gaming claim, and this latest ruling fell in the taxpayers favour.
As a result, the Company was able to further pursue its own gaming claim which was submitted in January 2006.
HMRC agreed to make a repayment of the existing claim, subject to the Company providing a guarantee to HMRC that, in the event that the existing decision is overturned in a higher court, the amount will be repayable in full.
HMRC has lodged an appeal with the European Court of Justice in respect of Rank plcs decision.
The Company is holding the repayment amount of 14,941,000 as a liability, until the Rank plc case has reached its final conclusion.
