the vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase in earnings per share over the vesting period.
in addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependent upon a share price target.
if the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
ii 2005 Key executive incentive plan Keip the Keip provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
the awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche.
the number of awards vesting is dependent upon the profit before tax of the Group for the year ending 31 march 2009 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 march 2010. if the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
iii long term incentive plan ltip the ltip provides for the grant of nil cost options.
the vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the total shareholder return performance of the Group over the relevant performance period.
iv Deferred bonus plan Dbp the Deferred bonus plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the company.
the deferred bonus may be matched by the company dependent upon the companys relative total shareholder return over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper decile performance.
the shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.
v save as you earn scheme saye the saye is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount.
the options can be exercised during a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.
121 the weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 17.34 2009: 14.68. the estimated fair values are calculated by applying a black-scholes option pricing model for the esop and saye and monte carlo simulations for the Keip, ltip and Deferred bonus plan.
the assumptions used in the models are as follows: input assumption share price price at date of grant exercise price per scheme rules expected volatility 20%45% option life per scheme rules expected dividends based on historic dividend yield risk free interest rate 3.8%5.2% levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.

the main risks arising from the companys financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
interest rate risk the companys exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the companys long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
the companys policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
to manage this, the company enters into interest rate swaps for certain periods, in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
these swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
the maturity profile of the companys financial liabilities is provided in the table below.
interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.

it is the companys policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the company, which comprise cash and cash equivalents the companys exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
the company manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
the company has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the companys board which sets the framework for the management of the companys short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
the company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
