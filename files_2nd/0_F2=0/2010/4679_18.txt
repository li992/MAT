Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments used to hedge risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations are initially and subsequently measured at fair value.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated by reference to market forward rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using market forward rates.
Gains or losses arising from the movement to fair value are taken to the income statement except where the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument, and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed at each reporting date to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedges The group has designated both interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges.
For cash flow hedges, the effective part of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Gains or losses relating to any ineffective part of changes in fair value are taken immediately to the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the hedged transaction occurs, for example when interest arising on 45 floating-rate debt is paid or the forecast sale or purchase transaction takes place.
Any movements in fair value occurring after the time when hedging contracts cease to be cash flow hedges are taken directly to the income statement.

Share options are only treated as dilutive in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if their exercise would result in the issue of shares at less than the average market price of the shares during the year.
Shares arising from share options, the deferred bonus scheme or the performance share plan are only treated as dilutive where the effect is to reduce earnings per share.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 42,234,000 2009: 20,219,000 by the average number of shares, including the effect of all dilutive potential shares, of 166,714,909 2009: 166,085,567.

Financial risk management and financial instruments Financial risk management The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks associated with interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and capital.
It is the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year, are consistent with the previous year, and are summarised below: Market risk a Interest rate risk The groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, together with currency swaps and cross-currency swaps used to hedge inter-company loans.
The group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and may use forward rate agreements or interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Although group policy permits the hedging of up to 50% of interest rate exposures on borrowings for a period not exceeding five years, no interest rate hedging was in place at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009.
Cash is held in interest-bearing current accounts where practicable, and all deposits are for periods of less than three months.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued 22.
Financial risk management and financial instruments continued A variation of, for example, 100 basis points in interest rates, applied to the groups borrowings, cash and short-term deposits at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009, would result in a movement in finance expense of 172,000 2009: 257,000 and finance income of 50,000 2009: 101,000.
This would result in a post-tax impact on the groups income statement of 88,000 2009: 110,000. b Foreign exchange risk The group has several significant overseas subsidiary undertakings whose revenues and expenses are denominated in a variety of currencies.
Group policy dictates that foreign currency exposures arising from future commercial transactions are reviewed by Group Treasury and hedging activities are undertaken as appropriate in order to manage the net foreign exchange risks arising.
Group policy permits the hedging of up to a maximum of 80% of the net external currency transaction exposures for periods of up to a maximum of fifteen months forward.
It is not group policy to routinely hedge translation exposures apart from inter-company loans.
Specific Board approval is required for any other translation exposure hedging.
The table below details the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the groups post-tax profit for the year ended 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 and equity at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
The gains and losses arise from translating receivables, payables, cash and derecognised currency hedges which are denominated in currencies other than each subsidiarys reporting currency.
The movements in equity arise from the translation of cash flow currency hedges.
In each case, it is assumed that the named currency is strengthening or weakening against all other currencies, while all the other currencies remain constant.
The percentage foreign currency movement is based on the experience of the previous four years.
Results are shown for all currencies where the impact on group post-tax profits would be more than 50,000.

The group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The group monitors its credit exposure using credit ratings, where applicable, and through its policy of requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
These procedures limit the groups exposure to any one party to approved levels.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable.
The group does not hold any collateral as security.
Liquidity risk The group has medium-term loan facilities which are regularly reviewed to ensure that they provide adequate liquidity for the group.
The facilities are managed on a centralised basis with appropriate local availability.
Details of the undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 are shown below: 2010 2009 000 000 Expiring in more than one year but less than two years 35,828 Expiring in more than two years 25,612 35,828 25,612 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 22.
Financial risk management and financial instruments continued At 31 December 2010, the group had in place unsecured floating rate loan facilities comprising committed elements with a total of 51.0 million 2009: 51.0 million and uncommitted working capital elements with a total of 7.0 million 2009: 7.0 million.
These are co-ordinated, bilateral facilities with three banks and the committed elements are due to expire on 24 January 2012.
The uncommitted facilities are renewable within one year.
The group was in compliance with the covenants related to its loan facilities throughout the years ending 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
In addition to the group facilities, local uncommitted facilities of US$ 2.0 million 2009: US$ 2.0 million and Czech koruna 60.0 million 2009: Czech koruna 60.0 million were also in place at 31 December 2010.
These facilities are renewable within one year.
Capital risk When managing capital, the groups objectives are to safeguard the business as a going concern, provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The principal measure used to monitor the strength of the groups balance sheet is the gearing ratio, which expresses the groups net debt as a percentage of its net assets.
Net debt is total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Net assets are as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 were as follows: 2010 2009 At 31 December 000 000 Total borrowings note 21 17,966 25,704 Less: cash and cash equivalents note 18 5,789 10,059 Net debt note 32 12,177 15,645 Net assets 153,000 114,071 Gearing ratio 8.0% 13.7% 63 Financial instruments Disclosures regarding financial instruments are set out below: Fair value of derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivative financial instruments are as follows: Group Company Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities 000 000 000 000 At 31 December 2010 Forward foreign currency contracts - cash flow hedge 624 209 - other 372 273 187 257 996 482 187 257 At 31 December 2009 Forward foreign currency contracts - cash flow hedge 259 387 - other 203 54 1 462 441 1 Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are disclosed by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
All of the groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 as at 31 December 2010 2009: Level 2.
Financial risk management and financial instruments continued At 31 December 2010, the net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases amounted to 415,000 2009: losses 128,000.
These will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur during 2011.

The fair values of trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and trade and other payables are equivalent to the carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
The fair value of other non-current liabilities has been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

The major schemes are of the defined benefit type and, with the exception of Germany where book reserves are supported by insurance policies, the assets of the schemes are held in separate trusteeadministered funds.
The defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
On the advice of the actuaries, cash contributions to the groups defined benefit schemes are expected to be 6.0 million for the year ending 31 December 2011 2010: 4.6 million.
The most significant defined benefit scheme within the group is the Devro Limited UK Pension Plan, which operates in the UK.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2008.
The other major defined benefit schemes are in Australia and the US.
Actuarial assumptions appropriate for each country have been used.
The last formal actuarial valuations of the groups material defined benefit schemes have been updated to 31 December 2010 by qualified independent actuaries.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries in the following principal countries were: Australia United Kingdom United States 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 Discount rate 4.90 5.10 5.40 5.80 5.31 5.85 Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 3.00 1.00 4.25 General inflation 2.50 2.50 3.40 3.45 2.60 2.80 As part of the changes to the United Kingdom plan agreed in 2010, future pensionable salary increases are capped at 1% per annum.
No rate of increase in salaries has been assumed in respect of the United States plan as the plan is now frozen.
The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligations.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy plan experience.
These assumptions are under continual review.
The mortality assumptions at 31 December 2010 are based on the following tables: Years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65 2010 2009 Male Female Male Female United Kingdom PA92 mc YOB 1% underpin 2 20.9 24.0 20.3 23.2 United States RP-2000 healthy projected to 2010 18.9 20.8 18.4 20.4 The Australian defined benefit scheme provides only for a lump sum payment on retirement.
In addition to the above schemes, the group operates a defined benefit retirement plan in Germany which, in common with typical practice in that country, is supported by insurance policies.
At 31 December 2010, the value of the insurance asset was 4.2 million 2009: 4.1 million and the value of the liability was 4.4 million 2009: 4.2 million.
In addition, the group has benefit arrangements in respect of two former executives in the US for which the group has made adequate provisions on the advice of the actuaries.
There is also an individual pension arrangement in Japan in respect of which appropriate contributions are made annually.
The plan in Germany and these additional arrangements in the US and Japan are included under the other heading in this note.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The net deficit position has improved significantly during the year.
The value of the assets in the schemes increased, reflecting rises in worldwide equity markets.
The value of scheme liabilities, however, fell slightly.
Changes to the UK scheme, made after consultation with employees and pensioners, resulted in a decrease of 18,851,000 in liabilities, but this was largely offset by increases resulting mainly from a fall in discount rates.
We continue to pay contributions to retirement schemes in accordance with local regulatory requirements and on the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
The actuaries continually review the funding position of the schemes.
Changes in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 At 1 January 180,963 165,486 Expected return on plan assets 11,030 9,846 Employer contributions 4,550 5,063 Member contributions 747 735 Benefits paid 11,057 10,146 Actuarial gains 9,275 12,029 Exchange gains losses 3,010 2,050 At 31 December 198,518 180,963 Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 At 1 January 212,796 191,311 Service cost 899 808 Interest cost 12,247 11,254 Member contributions 747 735 Benefits paid 11,057 10,146 Amendments 6,194 70 Plan curtailments 12,657 Actuarial losses 11,352 22,521 Exchange losses gains 3,790 3,687 At 31 December 211,923 212,796 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 24.

Share-based payments The Devro 2003 Performance Share Plan the plan was introduced in 2003.
Under the plan, the Executive Directors Remuneration Committee can make provisional allocations of ordinary shares in the company to employees of the group, including Executive Directors.
No payment for an allocation is made by a participant.
Allocations vest over a three-year period, are conditional on the continued employment of the participant and are subject to certain performance conditions.
These performance conditions relate to growth in operating profit of the subsidiary undertaking in which the participant is employed, growth in earnings per share of the group, the companys Total Shareholder Return, or a combination of these.
The fair value of an allocation represents the market value of the ordinary shares in the company on the date of the provisional allocation, less the discounted value of estimated dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period.
A participant is not entitled to receive dividends during this period.
Amounts provided in the accounts are based on an estimate of the probability of the targets in respect of allocations being achieved.
During the year, 742,730 shares vested under the plan 2009: nil.
