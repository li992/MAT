Capital management The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators: Gearing ratio 2010 2009 Net debt m 110.4 165.4 Total equity m 256.9 195.5 Gearing ratio % 43.0 84.6 Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity.
Net debt to EBITDA ratio 2010 2009 Net debt m 110.4 165.4 Operating profit m 49.3 17.1 Exceptional items excluding exceptional depreciation m - 17.4 Depreciation and amortisation m 25.8 21.8 EBITDA m 75.1 56.3 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 1.5 2.9 Net debt to EBITDA comprises net debt divided by operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items.
Interest cover 2010 2009 Operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items m 57.0 41.3 Net interest payable on bank overdrafts and loans, other loans and bank interest receivable m 10.7 10.2 Interest cover times 5.3 4.0 Interest cover comprises operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items divided by net interest payable on bank overdrafts and loans, other loans and bank interest receivable.
The Groups principal loan covenants are: interest cover - underlying operating profit being at least 2 times the net interest charge: and net debt to EBITDA ratio - net debt being less than 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.
At 31 August 2010, the Group comfortably complied with its loan covenants.
Interest cover was 5.3 times 2009: 4.0 times whilst net debt to reported EBITDA was 1.5 times 2009: 2.9 times.
In addition, for compliance with loan covenants, reported EBITDA is adjusted for, inter alia, acquisitions and non-cash items, therefore the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is lower when adjusted for these items.
During the year, the Group raised 35.2m from the placing of 17,302,233 new ordinary shares with institutional investors.
