Assessment of the Investment Manager A regular annual review of the management contract is undertaken by the Management Engagement Committee: however, the performance of the Manager in its role of Investment Manager, Company Secretary and Administrator is subject to continual review by the Board.
The investment objective of the Company is to generate capital growth with a higher than average income from investment mainly in the UK equity market.
Overall, the investment process is aiming to achieve absolute return through a genuinely active fund management approach.
As the Managers philosophy does not seek to regard the FTSE All-Share Index as the benchmark for portfolio construction, the portfolio may look substantially different from this index.
This may lead to periods of underperformance as well as periods of outperformance.
The Board has formally reviewed the Managers performance and, whilst short-term relative performance is below benchmark, the Manager has satisfactorily explained the reasons to the Board, details of which can be found in the investment managers report on pages 8 and 9.
He takes a medium to long-term view and has constructed a portfolio to reflect his prospects over that period.
The Board agrees with and supports his views and taking into account the long-term performance of the portfolio, the other services provided by the Manager and the risk and corporate governance environment in which the Company operates, the Board considers that the continuation of the management contract is in the best interests of shareholders as a whole.
