qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 79 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Groups combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The Group has also complied with South African Statements and Interpretations of Statements of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
There are no differences for the Group in applying IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group also complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the business review, under the heading Going concern.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation Dual listed structure The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company DLC structure.
The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited, and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries, operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity under IFRS.
Subsidiary undertakings The combined and consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, and of their respective subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities over which the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern operating and financial policy in order to obtain economic benefits.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the years presented are included in the combined and consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquiring control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into alignment with those used by the Group.
The interest of non-controlling interests is measured, at initial recognition, as the non-controlling proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition, except for those instances where the Group elects to measure the non-controlling interests at fair value in accordance with the allowance provided in IFRS 3, Business Combinations revised.
After initial recognition non-controlling interests are measured as the aggregate of the value at initial recognition and their subsequent proportionate share of profits and losses.
Associates Associates are investments over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Typically, the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity of its associates.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
The Groups share of associates net income, presented net of tax, is based on financial statements drawn up to reporting dates that are either coterminous with that of the Group or no more than three months prior to that date.
Where reporting dates are not coterminous, adjustments are made to the associates net income for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur after the associates reporting date up to the reporting date of the Group.
The total carrying values of investments in associates represent the cost of each investment including the carrying value of goodwill, the share of post-acquisition retained earnings, any other movements in reserves and any long-term debt interests which in substance form part of the Groups net investment in that entity.
The carrying values of associates are reviewed on a regular basis and if an impairment has occurred, it is written off in the year in which those circumstances arose.
The Groups share of an associates losses in excess of its interest in that associate is not recognised unless the Group has an obligation to fund such losses.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 80 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued Joint ventures A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest with a contractually agreed sharing of control over the strategic, financial and operating decisions with one or more other venturers.
The Groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by proportionate consolidation.
The Group combines its share of the joint ventures individual income, expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements.
The Group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets by the Group to the joint venture that is attributable to the other venturers.
The Group does not recognise its share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the Groups purchase of assets from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an independent party.
However, a loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an impairment loss.
Revenue recognition Sale of goods Revenue is derived principally from the sale of goods and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
This is when title and insurance risk has passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location.
Sale of green energy and CO credits 2 Revenues generated from the sale of green energy and CO credits issued under international schemes are recorded as 2 income within other net operating expenses in the combined and consolidated income statement when ownership rights pass to the buyer.
Investment income Interest income, which is derived from cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments, and loans and receivables, is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable effective interest rate.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment has been established.
Business combinations Identifiable net assets At the date of acquisition the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate are recorded at their fair values on acquisition date.
Assets and liabilities, which cannot be measured reliably, are recorded at provisional fair values which are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Cost of a business combination The cost of a business combination includes the fair value of assets provided, liabilities incurred or assumed, and any equity instruments issued by a Group entity, in exchange for control of an acquiree.
The directly attributable costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is attributed to goodwill.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries and joint ventures is included within intangible assets.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of associates.
Where the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired exceed the cost of the acquisition, the surplus, which represents the discount on the acquisition bargain purchase, is credited to the combined and consolidated income statement in the year of acquisition.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 81 1 Accounting policies continued Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Boards for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date during each financial year, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Non-current non-financial assets excluding goodwill, deferred tax and retirement benefits surplus Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprise land and buildings, property, plant and equipment and assets in the course of construction.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing the assets to the location and condition for their intended use and includes borrowing costs incurred up to the date of commissioning.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, and assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Buildings and plant and equipment are depreciated to their residual values at varying rates, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives range from three years to 20 years for items of plant and equipment and to a maximum of 50 years for buildings.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of cash cost and the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
These assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the expected useful lives of the assets.
Licences, other intangibles and research and development expenditure Licences and other intangibles are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives vary between three years and ten years and are reviewed at least annually.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Development costs are reviewed annually and are recognised as an expense if they do not qualify for capitalisation.
Development costs are capitalised when the completion of the asset is both commercially and technically feasible and is amortised on a systematic basis over the economic life of the related development.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Mondi Group 81 Financial statements Mondi GROUP 28-2-11 signed off.
qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 82 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued The recoverable amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset, or cash-generating unit, is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised as an expense.
Where the underlying circumstances change such that a previously recognised impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount.
Such reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset, or cash-generating unit, in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Agriculture Owned forestry assets Owned forestry assets are measured at fair value, calculated by applying the expected selling price, less costs to harvest and deliver, to the estimated volume of timber on hand at each reporting date.
The estimated volume of timber on hand is determined based on the maturity profile of the area under afforestation, the species, the geographic location and other environmental considerations and excludes future growth.
The product of these is then adjusted to present value by applying a market related pre tax discount rate.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement within other net operating expenses.
At point of felling, the carrying value of forestry assets is transferred to inventory.
Directly attributable costs incurred during the year of biological growth and investments in standing timber are capitalised and presented within cash flows from investing activities in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets, and disposal groups, are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non-current assets, and disposal groups, classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell from the date on which these conditions are met.
Any resulting impairment is reported through the combined and consolidated income statement as a special item.
On classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated or amortised.
Comparative amounts are not adjusted.
Discontinued operations are either a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that have been sold or are part of a single co-ordinated plan for disposal, or represent a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Current non-financial assets Inventory Inventory and work-in-progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the first-in-first-out FIFO or weighted average cost basis, as appropriate.
Cost comprises direct materials and overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is defined as the selling price less any estimated costs to sell.
Retirement benefits The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for its employees as well as post-retirement medical plans.
82 Annual report and accounts 2010 Mondi GROUP 28-2-11 signed off.
qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 83 1 Accounting policies continued Defined contribution plans For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the combined and consolidated income statement is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
Defined benefit and post-retirement medical plans For defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans, actuarial valuations are performed at each financial year end.
The average discount rate for the plans liabilities is based on AA rated corporate bonds or similar government bonds of a suitable duration and currency.
Pension plans assets are measured using year end market values.
Actuarial gains and losses, which arise from differences between expected and actual outcomes or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Any increase in the present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during the year is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on plan assets and the expected increase during the year in the present value of plan liabilities are included in investment income and interest expense respectively.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested or is amortised on a straight-line basis over the period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefits obligation recognised in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset retirement benefits surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the relevant Group scheme.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax charge, the movement in deferred tax and the South African Secondary Tax on Companies STC, which is a tax charge on dividends declared.
Current tax The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The Group pays STC on dividends declared by South African entities net of dividends received, based on the applicable STC rate.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition, other than in a business combination, of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 84 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the combined and consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated equity, in which case the deferred tax is also taken directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the combined and consolidated income statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern of use.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at inception of the lease at the lower of fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments derived by discounting using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The interest element of the rental is recognised as a finance charge in the combined and consolidated income statement, unless it is directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case it is capitalised in accordance with the Groups policy on borrowing costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, which it will be required to settle.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restoration and environmental costs An obligation to incur restoration and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the ongoing production of a plant or landfill site.
Costs for restoration of site damage are provided for at their present values and charged against profit or loss as the obligation arises.
Government grants Government grants are recognised when the right to receive such grants is established and are treated as deferred income.
They are released to the combined and consolidated income statement on a systematic basis, either over the expected useful lives of the assets for which they are provided, or over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.
Foreign currency transactions and translation Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are recorded in their functional currencies at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions.
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the combined and consolidated income statement for the year and are classified as either operating or financing depending on the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them.
84 Annual report and accounts 2010 Mondi GROUP 28-2-11 signed off.
qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 85 1 Accounting policies continued Translation of overseas operations The Groups results are presented in euros the Groups functional and presentation currency, the currency in which most of its business is conducted.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year where these approximate the rates at the dates of transactions.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss only on disposal or partial disposal of the overseas operation.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised concurrently as an expense and an adjustment to equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards granted, as adjusted for market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions where applicable.
Vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share awards that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the combined and consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups combined and consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial asset investments Investments, other than investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, are either classified as available-for-sale or loans and receivables.
Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at fair value.
They are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to fair value.
Any unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and deferred in equity until an investment is disposed of or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term, highly liquid investments of a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current liabilities on the combined and consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows and in the presentation of net debt are reflected net of overdrafts.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less allowance for any impairment as appropriate.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of direct transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 86 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued Net debt Net debt is a non-IFRS measure and consists of short-term, medium and long-term borrowings, bank overdrafts less cash and cash equivalents and current financial asset investments.
Borrowing costs Interest on borrowings directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets is capitalised until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the construction period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risk.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently held at fair value in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position within derivative financial instruments, and, when designated as hedges, are classified as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.
Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are classified as current, even when their actual maturity is expected to be greater than one year.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not formally designated in hedge relationships are recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement and are classified within Operating profit or Net finance costs, depending on the type of risk that the derivative relates to.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in the Groups cash flow hedge reserve in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, amounts deferred in the Groups cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss on a proportionate basis.
Fair value hedges For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Gains or losses from remeasuring the associated derivative are also recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Ineffective, expired, sold, terminated or exercised hedging instruments Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge relationship is revoked or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 87 1 Accounting policies continued Equity instruments, share issue costs, treasury shares and dividend payments Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction, net of applicable tax, from the proceeds.
An incremental share issue cost is one which would not have arisen if shares had not been issued.
Treasury shares The purchase by any Group entity of either Mondi Limiteds or Mondi plcs equity instruments results in the recognition of treasury shares.
The consideration paid is deducted from equity.
Where treasury shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to the equity holders of either Mondi Limited or Mondi plc, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects.
Dividend payments Dividend distributions to Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary equity holders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved.
Final dividends are accrued when approved by both Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary equity holders at their respective annual general meetings and interim dividends are recognised when approved by the Boards.
Special items Special items are those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group and its businesses.
Such items are material by nature or amount in relation to the financial years results.
Earnings per share EPS Basic EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent companies by the weighted average number of the sum of ordinary Mondi Limited and Mondi plc shares in issue during the year, net of treasury shares.
For this purpose, net profit is defined as the profit after tax and special items attributable to equity holders of the parent companies.
Diluted EPS For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of the sum of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary shares in issue, net of treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share awards granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease EPS.
The effect of anti-dilutive potential shares is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.
Underlying and headline EPS Underlying EPS excludes the impact of special items and is a non-IFRS measure.
It is included to provide an additional basis on which to measure the Groups earnings performance.
The presentation of headline EPS is mandated under the JSE Listings Requirements and is calculated in accordance with Circular 3 2009, Headline Earnings, as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Segmental reporting The Groups operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the DLC executive committee, being the chief operating decision-making body.

Standards, amendments to published Standards and Interpretations effective during 2010 The Group has adopted the following Standards, amendments to published Standards and Interpretations during the current year, all of which had no significant impact on the Groups results: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 2 Share-based Payment IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 17 Leases IAS 18 Revenue IAS 28 Investments in Associates IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures IAS 36 Impairment of Assets IAS 38 Intangible Assets IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers The Group has adopted IFRS 3, Business Combinations revised 2008, and IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised 2008.
Both Standards became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The most significant changes, all of which are applied prospectively, to the Groups previous accounting policies for business combinations are as follows: acquisition related costs which previously would have been included in the cost of a business combination are included in administrative expenses in the combined and consolidated income statement as they are incurred: any pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the date of obtaining control the acquisition date, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in profit or loss: any changes in the Groups ownership interest subsequent to the acquisition date are recognised directly in equity, with no adjustment to goodwill: and any changes to the cost of an acquisition, including contingent consideration, resulting from events after the acquisition date are recognised in profit or loss.
Previously, such changes resulted in an adjustment to goodwill.
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 1 January 2010 which result in an adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS 3 2004 and IAS 27 2005, for which the accounting policies can be found in the Groups annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The application of both revised Standards did not have a material impact on the Groups results.

This Standard will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
Accounting estimates and critical judgements The preparation of the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect certain items reported in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position and the combined and consolidated income statement.
The disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities is also affected by the use of estimation techniques.
Although the estimates used are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next financial year are disclosed below.
Estimated residual values and useful economic lives The carrying values of certain tangible fixed assets are sensitive to assumptions relating to projected residual values and useful economic lives, which determine the depreciable amount and the rate at which capital expenditure is depreciated.
The Group reassesses these assumptions at least annually or more often if there are indications that they require revision.
Estimated residual values are based on available secondary market prices as at the reporting date unless estimated to be zero.
Useful economic lives are based on the expected usage, wear and tear, technical or commercial obsolescence and legal limits on the usage of capital assets.
Estimated impairment of goodwill and tangible fixed assets For the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group incurred net asset impairment costs of E44 million 2009: E88 million see note 12 and goodwill impairment costs of Enil 2009: E12 million see note 11.
The Group assesses annually whether goodwill and tangible fixed assets have suffered any impairment, in accordance with the stated Group accounting policy.
The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and tangible fixed assets are determined based on value-in-use calculations, which require the exercise of managements judgement across a limited range of input assumptions and estimates.
The principal assumptions used relate to the time value of money and expected future cash flows.
The Group assesses annually whether there are any indications that items of property, plant and equipment, including assets in the course of construction, have suffered any impairment.
Indications of impairment are inherently judgemental and may require management to assess both internal and external sources of information.
Fair value of owned forestry assets For the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group recorded a fair value adjustment of E36 million 2009: E28 million.
Forestry assets as at 31 December 2010 totalled E320 million 2009: E251 million.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 90 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued The Group determines the fair value based on the present value of expected net cash flows arising from its owned forestry assets, discounted at a current, market determined pre tax rate.
Managements judgement is exercised in determining the future net cash flows and the discount rate.
Future net cash flows are dependent upon inputs including expected selling prices: costs of transport, harvesting, extraction and loading THEL : and the factor used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of standing timber which in itself is dependent on a variety of environmental factors.
Net selling price is selling price after deduction of THEL costs.
The reported value of owned forestry assets would change as follows should there be a change in these underlying sensitivities: E million 2010 Effect of E1 increase in net selling price 11 Effect of 1% increase in conversion factor hectares to tonnes 3 Effect of 1% increase in discount rate 3 Retirement benefits As at 31 December 2010 the retirement benefits asset was E11 million 2009: E8 million and the retirement benefits obligation was E211 million 2009: E184 million.
The Groups scheme liabilities are sensitive to changes in various underlying actuarial assumptions set by management.
These assumptions include the discount and inflation rates to apply to scheme liabilities, the mortality rates to apply to scheme members, the long-term medical cost trend rates to apply to medical schemes and the rates of increase of future salaries.
Further details regarding the assumptions are set out in note 24.
2 Operating segments Identification of the Groups externally reportable operating segments The Groups externally reportable segments reflect the internal reporting structure of the Group, which is the basis on which resource allocation decisions are made by management in the attainment of strategic objectives.
The Group operates under two primary geographic regions reflecting its South African activities and assets, and its international, principally European, activities and assets.
These broad geographic regions are further split by product segments reflecting the management of the Group.
In addition the Group manages Mondi Packaging South Africa and the Newsprint businesses separately and therefore these have been presented as separate segments.
Product revenues The material product types from which the Groups externally reportable segments derive both their internal and external revenues are presented as follows: 1 Operating segments Internal revenues External revenues Europe & International Uncoated Fine Paper Uncoated fine paper Uncoated fine paper Pulp Pulp Newsprint Newsprint Corrugated Corrugated products Corrugated products Bags & Coatings Kraft paper & industrial bags Kraft paper & industrial bags Coatings & consumer packaging South Africa Division Uncoated fine paper Uncoated fine paper Pulp Pulp Corrugated products Corrugated products Woodchips Mondi Packaging South Africa Corrugated products Corrugated products Recycled fibre Plastic packaging products Newsprint businesses Newsprint Newsprint Note: 1 The Group operates a  structure in order to benefit from economies of scale and to more effectively manage the risk of adverse price movements in key input costs.
Internal revenues are therefore generated across the supply chain.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 91 2 Operating segments continued Measurement of operating segment revenues, profit or loss, assets and non-current non-financial assets Management has regard to certain operating segment measures in making resource allocation decisions and monitoring segment performance.
The operating segment measures required to be disclosed adhere to the recognition and measurement criteria presented in the Groups accounting policies.
In addition, the Group has presented certain non-IFRS measures by segment to supplement the users understanding.
All intra-group transactions are conducted on an arms length basis.
The Groups measure of net segment assets includes the allocation of retirement benefits surpluses and deficits on an appropriate basis.
The measure of segment results exclude, however, the financing effects of the Groups defined benefit pension plans.
In addition, the Groups measure of net segment assets does not include an allocation for derivative assets and liabilities, nonoperating receivables and payables and assets held for sale and associated liabilities.
The measure of segment results includes the effects of certain movements in these unallocated balances.
The Groups geographic analysis is presented on the following level: continental: or sub-continental: or by individual country if greater than 10% of the Group total.
The Group disposed of its Merchant business, Europapier, during the year ended 31 December 2010.
The results of the Merchant business are included in the Newsprint businesses segment up to its date of disposal of 4 November 2010.
There has been no change in the basis of measurement of segment profit or loss in the financial year.

This led to the recognition of an asset impairment of E20 million and related restructuring costs of E6 million.
The completion of the sale of the Szolnok site resulted in the reversal of previously recognised restructuring and closure provisions and the realisation of the cumulative translation adjustment reserve, amounting to E10 million.
The restarting of the Stambolijski kraft paper line resulted in a reversal of impairment E8 million and related provisions E17 million recognised for the closure that are no longer required.
Underperforming non-integrated kraft paper assets in Lohja and Ruzomber ok were partially impaired by E8 million.
The start-up of the recently completed capital project in Syktyvkar resulted in the impairment of obsolete assets of E3 million and further restructuring costs of E3 million.
The acquisition of eight industrial bag plants in western Europe from Smurfit Kappa UK Limited resulted in a gain of E34 million being recognised.
Restructuring activities were necessary to streamline the acquisition and to promote efficiency and profitability which resulted in E28 million of restructuring and closure costs being recognised.
Other smaller operating special items include a reversal of asset impairment of E1 million, reversal of certain restructuring and closure costs of E4 million, restructuring costs of E1 million in Europe & International and asset impairments of E1 million each in Mondi Shanduka Newsprint and Mondi Packaging South Africa.
Non-operating special items The sale of the corrugated plants in the UK to Smurfit Kappa UK Limited resulted in a loss on disposal including realisation of the cumulative translation adjustment reserve of E16 million and an impairment of assets of E1 million.
Purchase price adjustments relating to the sale of Cartonstrong and Niedergsgen resulted in a gain of E3 million being recognised.
The Group disposed of a portion of its shareholding in Mondi Hadera Paper Limited, retaining a non-controlling share of 25% and recognising a gain on disposal of E1 million.
The sale of 38,425 hectares of forestry assets in South Africa realised a gain of E16 million.
On classification as held for sale in May 2010, the non-current assets of Europapier were impaired in full resulting in a E13 million charge.
The transaction was concluded on 4 November 2010 and a loss on disposal of E15 million was realised.
A total charge of E28 million was therefore recognised in respect of the disposal of Europapier.
Year ended 31 December 2009 Operating special items Difficult trading conditions during the year resulted in management taking decisive action to further restructure the cost base incurring restructuring and closure costs amounting to E43 million, the most significant of which was the closure of the Stambolijski mill.
Goodwill of E12 million, relating to the paper merchant Europapier was impaired.
Further asset impairments of E78 million were recognised, the most significant of which was a UK corrugated plant and an uncoated fine paper machine in South Africa.
Other operating special items included insurance proceeds for a fire damaged asset and the cost of equity settled demerger arrangements for senior management.

2 Licences and other intangibles mainly relate to software development costs, customer relationships and contractual arrangements capitalised as a result of business combinations.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash-generating units CGUs which reflect how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
With effect from 1 January 2011, the Coating & Release and Consumer Flexibles business units have been combined into a single economic unit, Coatings & Consumer Packaging.
As a result, the goodwill calculation is now based on the Coatings & Consumer Packaging CGU and the impairment calculations, being forward-looking in nature, have been performed based on the new reporting structure.
There was no impact on the impairment of goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets covering a three year period that are based on the latest forecasts for revenue and cost as approved by the Boards.
Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management forecasts and assume a growth rate not exceeding gross domestic product for the respective countries.
Zero percent growth rates are assumed in perpetuity for most of the businesses given the commodity nature of the majority of the products i. e. volume growth is assumed to be offset by real price declines.
Post tax cash flow projections are discounted using a post tax discount rate of 6.62% 2009: 8.83%, adjusted by 0%-3% reflecting the economic and political risks of the specific location that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows specific to each CGU.
Perpetuity maintenance capital expenditure has been assumed at 60% of depreciation.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time.
They are significantly affected by a number of factors, including market and production estimates, together with economic factors such as prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure.
In respect of the CGUs that have not been impaired, sensitivity analyses of a 1% increase in discount rate or a 1% decrease in cash flows were performed and these did not give rise to an impairment.

Credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and invoicing conventions established by participants operating in, the various markets in which the Group operates.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are considered overdue in the relevant market.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the combined and consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
The total gross carrying value of these impaired trade receivables as at the reporting date is E116 million 2009: E134 million and the associated aggregate impairment is E51 million 2009: E61 million.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling E47 million 2009: E95 million which are past due but not impaired as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: Trade receivables past due by Less than More than E million 1 month 1-2 months 2-3 months 3 months Total Carrying value as at 31 December 2010 28 7 3 9 47 Carrying value as at 31 December 2009 59 16 7 13 95 Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are debtor balances with customers totalling E6 million 2009: E6 million where contractual terms have been renegotiated to extend the credit period offered.
The Group believes that these balances are fully recoverable and therefore no impairment loss has been recognised.
The Group has entered into certain debt factoring arrangements in which the financial counterparties retain recourse in the event of debtor default.
Accordingly, the Group continues to recognise the underlying trade receivables transferred until cash settlement occurs.
A concurrent financial liability is also recognised in respect of the obligation to transfer economic benefits to financial counterparties.
At the reporting date, trade receivables with a value of E9 million 2009: E3 million are subject to such factoring arrangements and an associated financial liability of Enil 2009: E1 million has been recognised.

The principal loan arrangements in place include the following: E1.55 billion Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility UKRCF The UKRCF is a five year multi-currency revolving credit facility which was signed on 22 June 2007.
This facility was initially drawn down to refinance existing debt obligations outstanding to the Anglo American plc group prior to demerger.
Interest is charged on the balance outstanding at a market-related rate linked to LIBOR.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to limit its exposure to adverse movements in LIBOR see note 37.
E500 million Eurobond Mondi Finance plc launched its inaugural publicly traded bond, guaranteed by Mondi plc, on 26 March 2010.
The E500 million bond, which matures on 3 April 2017, was issued at a discount of E5.63 million and pays a fixed coupon of 5.75% per annum.
The bond contains a coupon step up clause whereby the coupon will be increased by 1.25% per annum whilst Mondi fails to maintain at least one investment grade credit rating from either Moodys or Standard & Poors.
Mondis credit ratings, which have remained unchanged since first published in March 2010, were BB Standard & Poors and Baa3 Moodys.
The Moodys credit rating is investment grade.
E160 million Export Credit Agency Facility ECAF The ECAF is used to part finance expansionary capital expenditure in Russia.
The facility has an amortising repayment until 2020 and interest is charged on the balance outstanding at a market-related rate linked to LIBOR.
PLN474 million European Investment Bank Facility EIBF The EIBF is used to part finance expansionary capital expenditure at Mondi Swiecie in Poland.

The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
The Group has pledged certain assets as collateral against certain borrowings.
The fair values of these assets as at 31 December are as follows: E million 2010 2009 Assets held under finance leases Property, plant and equipment 20 16 Assets pledged as collateral for other borrowings Property, plant and equipment 230 222 Inventories 79 69 Financial assets 166 165 Other 20 15 Total value of assets pledged as collateral 515 487 The Group is entitled to receive all cash flows from these pledged assets.

Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Appropriate valuation methodologies are employed to measure the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The notional amounts presented represent the aggregate face value of all foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity price derivatives outstanding at the reporting date.
They do not indicate the contractual future cash flows of the derivative instruments held or their current fair value and therefore do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or market risks.
Note 37 provides an overview of the Groups management of financial risks through the selective use of derivative financial instruments and also includes a presentation of the undiscounted future contractual cash flows of the derivative contracts outstanding at the reporting date.

A provision is recognised for the present value of such costs.
These costs are expected to be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
Included within other provisions are amounts relating to onerous contracts and employee benefits.
Of these, E30 million 2009: E18 million are due to be incurred within the next 12 months.
The residual E14 million 2009: E12 million will be incurred over a period longer than one year.
All non-current provisions are discounted using a discount rate relevant in the local countries, based on a pre tax real yield on long-term bonds over the last five years.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 120 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 23 Deferred tax continued The Group has the following amounts in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams or gains against which these could be utilised: E million 2010 2009 Tax losses revenue 1,529 1,763 Tax losses capital 16 16 Other temporary differences 16 2 Total 1,561 1,781 Included in unrecognised tax losses, as at 31 December 2010, are losses of E1 million 2009: E1 million that will expire within one year, E28 million 2009: E62 million that will expire between one and five years, and E223 million 2009: E148 million that will expire after five years.
A further E1,293 million 2009: E1,568 million of losses have no expiry date.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on gross temporary differences of E569 million 2009: E515 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A change to UK tax legislation largely exempts from UK tax overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
As a result, the gross temporary differences at 31 December 2010 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
In addition, the Group would crystallise an STC liability of approximately E20 million 2009: E16 million on ultimate distribution of its unremitted earnings to external shareholders.
24 Retirement benefits The Group operates post-retirement defined contribution and defined benefit plans for the majority of its employees.
It also operates post-retirement medical plans in South Africa.
The accounting policy for pensions and post-retirement benefits is included in note 1.
Defined contribution plans The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans of E17 million 2009: E17 million is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at the reporting dates presented.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans Only a few of the post-retirement defined benefit plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world.
The majority of the post-retirement defined benefit plans are unfunded pension and severance plans which are principally in Europe.
The post-retirement medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain of their dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
These plans are unfunded and there are no plan assets in respect of post-retirement medical plans.
The South African plan has been closed to new participants since 1 January 1999.

Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every three years using the projected credit unit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2010.
The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 110% 2009: 106% of the benefits which have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions at rates agreed with the schemes trustees and in accordance with local actuarial advice and statutory provisions.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members.
Consequently, it is expected that the Groups share of contributions will increase as the schemes members age.
The aggregate benefit obligation in respect of the unfunded plans as at 31 December 2010 is E106 million 2009: E109 million.
The total loss, net of applicable tax, recognised in equity relating to experience movements on scheme liabilities and plan assets and actuarial assumption changes, excluding surplus restriction movements, for the year ended 31 December 2010 is E10 million 2009: E9 million.
The cumulative total recognised since 1 January 2004 is a loss of E7 million.

The businesses acquired incurred operating losses prior to their acquisition by Mondi and are subject to restructuring activities.
As a result of this and the cash in the business on date of acquisition, a gain on acquisition is recognised in special items in the combined and consolidated income statement.
The fair value accounting reflected in these results is provisional in nature.
If necessary, adjustments will be made to these carrying values, and to the gain on acquisition, within 12 months of the acquisition date.
To date, restructuring costs of E28 million have been incurred see note 5.
Prior to any planned restructuring activities, the acquired industrial bag plants generated turnover of approximately E7 million per month and underlying operating losses of E0.8 million per month.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2010, the increase in revenue would have been E95 million with a loss after tax of E40 million.
Transaction costs of E1 million related to the acquisition are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
There were no other acquisitions made for the year ended 31 December 2010.
The deferred acquisition consideration relating to the acquisition in 2007 of Tire Kutsan of E14 million was paid during the current year.

30 Disposal of subsidiaries and associates On 5 May 2010, Mondi signed an agreement with the Heinzel Group for the sale of 100% of its shares in Europapier, a paper merchant business selling graphic, packaging and office papers, as well as other office supplies to customers across central Europe and Russia.
The tangible fixed assets were subsequently fully impaired E13 million on classification as held for sale.
The impairment, together with the loss on disposal of the business of E15 million, is recognised in special items in the combined and consolidated income statement.
The transaction was concluded on 4 November 2010.
On 8 September 2010, Mondi signed a sale agreement with Hadera Paper Limited to reduce its interest in Mondi Hadera Paper Limited, a non-integrated paper mill in Israel with capacity to produce 145,000 tonnes per annum of office and printing papers, which are predominately sold in the Israeli market, from a 50.1% controlling interest to a 25% non-controlling interest.
The remaining 25% non-controlling interest is accounted for as an associate.
The gain on disposal of the business of E1 million is recognised in special items in the combined and consolidated income statement.
The transaction was concluded on 31 December 2010.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 136 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 36 Capital management The Group defines its total capital employed as equity, as presented in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position, plus net debt see note 32, excluding loans to joint ventures, less financial asset investments.
E million 2010 2009 Total borrowings see note 32c 1,388 1,554 1 Less: Cash and cash equivalents see note 32c 24 37 Net debt see note 32c 1,364 1,517 Less: Financial asset investments Loans and receivables see note 16 20 10 Available-for-sale investments see note 16 14 17 Adjusted net debt 1,330 1,490 Equity 3,224 2,824 Total capital employed 4,554 4,314 Note: 1 Net of overdrafts.
Total capital employed is managed on a basis that enables the Group to continue trading as a going concern, while delivering acceptable returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Additionally, the Group is also committed to reducing its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the future level of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase shares from shareholders, issue new equity instruments or dispose of assets to reduce its net debt exposure.
The Group reviews its total capital employed on a regular basis and makes use of several indicative ratios which are appropriate to the nature of the Groups operations and are consistent with conventional industry measures.
The principal ratios used in this review process are: gearing, defined as net debt divided by total capital employed: and return on capital employed, defined as underlying operating profit, plus share of associates net income, before special items, divided by average capital employed.
The Group operates a DLC structure which has been agreed with the South African Ministry of Finance and is subject to certain exchange control conditions.
The exchange control conditions do not infringe upon the Groups ability to manage its capital structure optimally.
However, they do require that the capital supplied by, or made available to, the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, is constrained by the equality of treatment mechanism, which serves to maintain and protect the economic interests of both sets of shareholders.
The Group has continually met the exchange control provisions in the past and management is committed to ensuring that the Group continues to meet these provisions in future.
37 Financial risk management The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Boards and are overseen by the DLC executive committee.
In turn, the DLC executive committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group treasury continually reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks by entering into derivative contracts with counterparties where appropriate.
The Group does not take speculative positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 137 37 Financial risk management continued Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Both risks are actively monitored on a continuous basis and managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps respectively.
Although the Groups cash flows are exposed to movements in key input and output prices, such movements represent economic rather than residual financial risk inherent to the Group.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates across various national boundaries and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of its business.
Multiple currency exposures arise from forecast commercial transactions denominated in foreign currencies, recognised financial assets and liabilities monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and the translational exposure on net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign exchange contracts The Groups foreign exchange policy requires its subsidiaries to actively manage foreign currency exposures against their functional currencies by entering into foreign exchange contracts.
For segmental reporting purposes, each subsidiary enters into, and accounts for, foreign exchange contracts with Group treasury or with counterparties that are external to the Group, whichever is more commercially appropriate.
Only material balance sheet exposures and highly probable forecast capital expenditure transactions are hedged.
Currencies bought or sold forward to mitigate possible unfavourable movements on recognised monetary items are marked to market at each reporting date.
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at each reporting date to incorporate the underlying foreign exchange movements and any such movements naturally off-set fair value movements on related forward foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis has been performed on the foreign currency exposures inherent in the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting dates presented, net of related foreign exchange contracts.
The sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the Groups reported earnings of reasonably possible changes in the currency exposures embedded within the functional currency environments that the Group operates in.
In addition, an indication is provided of how reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates might impact on the Groups equity, as a result of fair value adjustments to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
Reasonably possible changes are based on an analysis of historic currency volatility, together with any relevant assumptions regarding near-term future volatility.

2 Net monetary exposures represent financial assets less financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency, adjusted for the effects of foreign exchange risk hedging, excluding cash flow hedging of non-monetary assets and liabilities.
Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates The Group believes that for each functional to foreign currency net monetary exposure it is reasonable to assume a 5% appreciation depreciation of the functional currency.
If all other variables are held constant, the table below presents the impacts on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement if these currency movements had occurred.
Income expense 2010 E million 5% -5% Functional currency zones: Turkish lira 2 2 Other 1 1 Income expense 2009 E million 5% -5% Functional currency zones: Russian rouble 5 5 Other 2 2 138 Annual report and accounts 2010 Mondi GROUP 28-2-11 signed off.
qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 139 37 Financial risk management continued The corresponding fair value impact on the Groups equity, resulting from the application of these reasonably possible changes to the valuation of the Groups foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, would have been Enil 2009:Enil.
It has been assumed that changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of non-monetary assets and liabilities are fully recorded in equity and that all other variables are held constant.
Interest rate risk The Group holds cash and cash equivalents, which earn interest at a variable rate and has variable and fixed rate debt in issue.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk.
Although the Group has fixed rate debt in issue, the Groups accounting policy stipulates that all borrowings are held at amortised cost.
As a result, the carrying value of fixed rate debt is not sensitive to changes in credit conditions in the relevant debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
Management of cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with short-term highly liquid investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Centralised cash pooling arrangements are in place, which ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and, in addition, to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
Management of variable rate debt The Group has multiple variable rate debt facilities, of which the most significant is the syndicated facility, denominated in euros see note 20.
Group treasury uses interest rate swaps to hedge certain exposures to movements in the relevant inter-bank lending rates, primarily the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate JIBAR.
Interest rate swaps are ordinarily formally designated as cash flow hedges and are fair valued at each reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined at each reporting date by reference to the discounted contractual future cash flows, using the relevant currency-specific yield curves, and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents also act as a natural hedge against possible unfavourable movements in the relevant inter-bank lending rates on its variable rate debt, subject to any interest rate differentials that exist between corporate saving and lending rates.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity analysis The net variable rate exposure represents variable rate debt less the future cash outflows swapped from variable-to-fixed via interest rate swap instruments and cash and cash equivalents.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates have been applied to net variable rate exposure, as denominated by currency, in order to provide an indication of the possible impact on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.

Several Group entities have also issued certain financial guarantees to external counterparties in order to achieve competitive funding rates for specific debt agreements entered into by other Group entities.
None of these financial guarantees contractually obligates the Group to pay more than the recognised financial liabilities in the entities concerned.
As a result, these financial guarantee contracts have no bearing on the credit risk profile of the Group as a whole.
The Group has also provided committed loan facilities to Mondi Packaging South Africa and Mondi Shanduka Newsprint.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table.
Groups exposure to credit risk E million 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents 83 123 Derivative financial instruments 14 7 Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and accrued income 970 915 Loans and receivables 20 10 Total credit risk exposure 1,087 1,055 Credit risk associated with trade receivables The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any particular customer.
The Group believes that there is no significant geographical concentration of credit risk.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the relevant markets that they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across all business segments, such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.
Of the total trade receivables balance of E854 million 2009: E824 million included in trade and other receivables reported in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position see note 18, credit insurance covering E526 million 2009: E410 million of the total balance has been taken out by the Groups trading entities to insure against the related credit default risk.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 142 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
The following table shows the amounts available to draw down on the Groups committed loan facilities.
E million 2010 2009 Expiry date In one year or less 44 141 In more than one year 1,437 849 Total credit available 1,481 990 Forecast liquidity represents the Groups expected cash inflows, principally generated from sales made to customers, less the Groups  cash outflows, principally related to supplier payments and the repayment of borrowings, including finance lease obligations, plus the payment of any interest accruing thereon.
The matching of these cash inflows and outflows rests on the expected ageing profiles of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Short-term financial assets and financial liabilities are represented primarily by the Groups trade receivables and trade payables respectively.
The matching of the cash flows that result from trade receivables and trade payables takes place typically over a period of three to four months from recognition in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position and is managed to ensure the ongoing operating liquidity of the Group.
Financing cash outflows may be longer-term in nature.
The Group does not hold long-term financial assets to match against these commitments, but is significantly invested in long-term non-financial assets which generate the sustainable future cash inflows, net of future capital expenditure requirements, needed to service and repay the Groups borrowings.
The Group also assesses its commitments under interest rate swaps, which hedge future cash flows from two to five years from the reporting date presented.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The Groups financial investments, which are not held for trading and therefore do not comprise part of the Groups liquidity planning arrangements, make up the remainder of the non-derivative financial assets held.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
Non-interest bearing financial liabilities which are due to be settled in less than 12 months from maturity equal their carrying values, since the impact of the time value of money is immaterial over such a short duration.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 144 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management continued Fair value estimation Financial instruments that are measured in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position at fair value require disclosure of fair value measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy: level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives are determined using standard valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.
The significant inputs required to fair value all of the Groups financial instruments are observable.
The Group does not hold any financial instruments categorised as either level 1 or level 3 financial instruments.
Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include: the fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves and exchange rates.
the Groups commodity price derivatives are fair valued by independent third parties, who in turn calculate the fair values as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable market data.
other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.
