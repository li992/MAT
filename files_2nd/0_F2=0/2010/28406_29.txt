In order to align the weekly Home Credit business with the groups financial year, Home Credits financial year includes 53 weeks, compared with 52 weeks in 2009.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations.
The exceptional cost in 2010 of 2.5m represents the write down of residual fixed assets following the Consumer Credit Divisions move into a new head office building in October 2010 see note 12.
The exceptional cost in 2009 of 4.4m see note 3 comprised: a 6.8m charge in respect of the fair value movements on interest rate swaps which were previously deferred in equity as cashflow hedges but which became ineffective following the issue of the groups fixed-rate 250m senior public bonds on 23 October 2009 and the consequent repayments under the groups revolving floating rate bank facilities: and a 2.4m credit reflecting the 2.5% discount in respect of the repurchase of 94.0m of the groups subordinated loan notes on 23 October 2009.
Revenue between business segments is not material.
All of the groups operations operate in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

The impact of this is an increase in the notional allocation of group borrowings to the Consumer Credit Division of 171.6m 2009: 129.1m and an increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
The intra-group elimination adjustment removes this notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.

During the year, as a result of the change in UK corporation tax rates which will be effective from 1 April 2011, deferred tax balances have been re-measured.
Deferred tax relating to temporary differences which are expected to reverse prior to 1 April 2011 is measured at a tax rate of 28% and deferred tax relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2011 is measured at a tax rate of 27%, as these are the tax rates which will apply on reversal.
A tax charge of 0.2m in 2010 2009: nil represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of this change.
An additional deferred tax credit of 0.2m in 2010 2009: nil has been taken directly to equity, reflecting the impact of the change in UK corporation tax rates on items previously reflected directly in equity.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
For share options and awards, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options and awards.

The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2010 was 105% for the Consumer Credit Division 2009: 100% and 35% for Vanquis Bank 2009: 35%.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within the Consumer Credit Division is 6.0 months 2009: 6.2 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is currently the higher of 5 or 4.5% of their outstanding balance.
The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 1.5 billion 2009: 1.4 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cashflows net of collection costs at the groups weighted average cost of capital at the balance sheet date.
The credit quality of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: Group 2010 2009 Credit quality of amounts receivable from customers m m Neither past due nor impaired 611.4 545.4 Past due but not impaired 139.6 129.5 Impaired 468.3 464.4 Total 1,219.3 1,139.3 Past due but not impaired balances all relate to Home Credit loans within the Consumer Credit Division.
There are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank or in respect of the unsecured direct repayment loans within the Consumer Credit Division which are past due but not impaired.
In the Home Credit business of the Consumer Credit Division, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cashflows from loans deteriorate significantly.

2001 and 2003 private placement loan notes The group and company have put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the 2001 and 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes into fixed rate sterling liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes see note 21 e. These swaps were designated as cashflow hedges and were effective under IAS 39 in the year ended 31 December 2010.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the corresponding exchange movements on the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2001 US dollar private placement loan notes have a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% 2009: 7.6%, a range of interest rates of 7.6% 2009: 7.6% and a weighted average period to maturity of 0.4 years 2009: 1.4 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group and company 2010 2009 m m Liability at 1 January 1.9 0.1 Exchange rate movements 0.5 1.5 Charged to the hedging reserve 0.3 Liability at 31 December 1.4 1.9 The exchange rate movements reflect the movement in the year of the difference between the translation of the 2001 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year end exchange rate compared to the contracted rate.
A corresponding entry is made to borrowings.
The amount charged to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps and the exchange rate movements described above.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes have a weighted average interest rate of 6.8% 2009: 6.7%, a range of interest rates of 6.8% 2009: range of 6.6% to 6.8% and a weighted average period to maturity of 2.3 years 2009: 2.2 years.

The amount credited charged to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the crosscurrency swaps and the exchange rate movements described above.
2004 private placement loan notes The group has put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the US dollar private placement loan notes issued in 2004 into floating rate sterling interest liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes see note 21 e. The swaps comprise both cashflow hedges and fair value hedges.
The cashflow hedge portion of the swaps were designated as cashflow hedges and were effective under IAS 39 in the year ended 31 December 2010.
The movements in the swaps and the exchange movements in the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges during the year.
As a result, fair value movements in the swaps were charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry made to the underlying loan notes within borrowings for the effective portion of the swaps, leaving a net charge within the income statement reflecting the net fair value loss on the fair value hedge in the year.
The swaps have a range of interest rates from LIBOR 1.58% to LIBOR 1.63% 2009: LIBOR 1.58% to LIBOR 1.63% and a weighted average period to maturity of 2.7 years 2009: 3.7 years.

Provident Financial plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Company number 668987 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 111 18 Retirement benefit asset a Pension schemes defined benefit The group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme.
The scheme covers 62% of employees with company-provided pension arrangements and is of the funded, defined benefit type providing retirement benefits based on final salary.
Following a full group review of pension scheme arrangements, from 1 April 2006 members were provided with a choice of paying higher member contributions to continue accruing benefits based on final salary or paying a lower member contribution and accruing benefits based on a percentage of salary which would be revalued each year.
The most recent actuarial valuation of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out as at 1June 2009 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits has been based on this valuation updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity investments reflect anticipated long-term real rates of return.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate should be determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds and that the term of the instruments chosen should be consistent with the estimated term of the defined benefit obligations.
In the UK, this is usually interpreted to mean the yield on AA-rated corporate bonds of an appropriate term.
A movement of 0.1% in the discount rate would increase or decrease the retirement benefit asset by approximately 9m 2009: 9m.
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme are based on the mortality experience of self-administered pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The group uses the S1PA standard tables as the basis for projecting mortality adjusted for the following factors: A 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and a 15% upwards adjustment for females is made in order to reflect lower life expectancies within the scheme compared to average pension schemes: and The projections are combined with the medium cohort improvement factors in order to predict future improvements in life expectancy, subject to an annual minimum rate of improvement of 1%.
In more simple terms, it is now assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 23 years if they are male 2009: 23 years and for a further 25 years if they are female 2009: 25 years.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater for the scheme, the retirement benefit asset would have been reduced by approximately 16m 2009: 14m.
The actual return on scheme assets compared to the expected return is as follows: Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Expected return on scheme assets 29.1 24.9 9.5 7.9 Actuarial movement on scheme assets 22.9 29.9 8.7 10.6 Actual return on scheme assets 52.0 54.8 18.2 18.5 Company number 668987 Provident Financial plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 114 Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Retirement benefit asset continued Actuarial gains and losses are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
