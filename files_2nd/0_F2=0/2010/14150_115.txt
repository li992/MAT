The Directors believe that adjusting earnings per share for the effect of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles excluding landfill void and computer software and exceptional items enables comparison with historical data calculated on the same basis.
Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed separately on the face of the income statement because of their size or incidence to enable a better understanding of performance.
Changes in the fair values of interest rate swaps that the Group is required to enter into in relation to its earlier PFI arrangements are considered to be exceptional items.
