B Operating expenses i Operating expenses Operating expenses comprise: 2010 2009 m m Staff costs and other employee related expenditure see below 159 130 Other operating costs 42 20 Net foreign exchange gains losses 25 44 Total 176 194 ii Staff costs Total staff costs were: 2010 2009 m m Wages and salaries 109 85 Social security costs 10 9 Post-retirement obligations Defined benefit schemes see iii below 8 6 Defined contribution schemes 5 6 Profit sharing and incentive plans 10 9 Equity compensation plans see iv below 15 12 Termination benefits 2 3 Total 159 130 iii Pension costs The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in the financial statements of the main UK employing company.
The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year for its staff, together with the service cost of any unfunded benefits, within staff costs above.
Full disclosure on the Groups pension schemes is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48. iv Equity compensation plans All transactions in the Groups equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company.
Full disclosure of these plans is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 30.
The cost of such options and awards is borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge.
As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to directors options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors Remuneration Report, no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of immateriality.
