This note shows the movements in this surplus during the year.
The following movements have occurred in the year: 2010 2009 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 3,866 2,325 Change in participating contract assets 444 1,314 Change in participating contract liabilities 169 3,836 Effect of special bonus to with-profit policyholders see note 45a 58 69 Effect of reattribution of inherited estate see note 45b 881 Other movements 4 25 Change in liability recognised as an expense 329 1,547 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 3 4 Movement in respect of change in pension scheme deficit note 48c i 18 24 Foreign exchange rate movements 61 43 Other movements 63 21 Carrying amount at 31 December 3,428 3,866 In Italy and Spain, the UDS balances were 435 million negative in total at 31 December 2010 2009: Italy 92 million negative because of an accounting mismatch between participating assets carried at market value and participating liabilities measured using local practice.
The negative balance is considered to be recoverable from margins in the existing participating business liabilities.
45 Special bonus and reattribution of the inherited estate This note describes the special distribution and reattribution of the inherited estate in our UK Life business.
a Special bonus declared by UK Life business On 5 February 2008, the Groups UK long-term business operation, Norwich Union Life, announced a one-off, special bonus worth an estimated 2.3 billion, benefiting around 1.1 million with-profit policyholders in its CGNU Life and CULAC with-profit funds.
The bonus has been used to enhance policy values by around 10% in total, in three instalments, with the qualifying dates being 1 January 2008, 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2010.
In accordance with the way the funds are managed, the bonus distribution has been split on a 90 10 basis between policyholders and shareholders.
2,127 million was set aside for policyholders on 1 January 2008 and has been allocated over the three years.
Similarly, shareholders were expected to receive 236 million over the three-year period.
As explained in accounting policies F and K, the Groups insurance and participating investment contract liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and FRS 27, Life Assurance.
The latter requires liabilities for with-profit funds falling within the scope of the UKs Financial Services Authoritys capital regime to be determined in accordance with this regime, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
This required us to recognise planned discretionary bonuses within policyholder liabilities at 31 December 2007, even if there was no constructive obligation at the time.
As a result of the announcement made above, a transfer of 2,127 million was made in 2007 from the UDS in order to increase insurance liabilities by 1,728 million and participating investment contract liabilities by 399 million.
Of the original 236 million due to shareholders, 58 million has been transferred from the UDS in 2010 2009: 69 million.
b Impact of the reattribution of the inherited estate On 1 October 2009, a reorganisation of the with-profit funds of CGNU Life Assurance Limited CGNU and Commercial Union Life Assurance Company Limited CULAC was approved by the Board and became effective.
The reorganisation was achieved through a reattribution to shareholders of the inherited estates of these funds.
As part of the reorganisation the two funds were merged and transferred to Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited UKLAP.
Within UKLAP, two new with-profit sub-funds were created.
Policies of non-electing policyholders were transferred to the Old With-Profit Sub-Fund OWPSF.
The inherited estate has not been reattributed and remains in the OWPSF.
Where policyholders elected to accept the reattribution, their policies were transferred to the New With-Profit Sub-Fund NWPSF.
The inherited estate, totalling 1,105 million at 1 October 2009, was reattributed to a separate long-term fund called the Non-Profit Sub-Fund 1 NPSF1, in which 100% of the surplus is attributable to shareholders.
On the effective date of 1 October 2009, the unallocated divisible surplus of NWPSF was released as it has been allocated to shareholders.
The reorganisation scheme has imposed certain restrictions around release of the assets allocated to shareholders as a result of this transaction, to ensure that sufficient protection for with-profit policyholder benefits is maintained.
The initial impact of the reorganisation on profit before tax in 2009 was 202 million, of which a loss of 5 million was recognised in operating profit, reflecting the value derived from the reorganisation.
The remaining 207 million was recognised outside operating profit, offsetting the shareholder tax attributable to the transaction.
The ongoing impact of the reattribution is that profit recognised in the NWPSF, which prior to the reattribution would have been transferred to the unallocated distributable surplus, is now recognised in profit attributable to shareholders.
