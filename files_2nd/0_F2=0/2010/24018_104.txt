These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio over 540 at 31 December 2010 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio see note 16 : and the existence of ongoing overdraft and loan facility agreements.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Company does not normally invest in derivative products.
The Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 100m as set out in note 14 on the accounts.
The 11.25% Debenture Stock is governed by a trust deed and is redeemable in 2014 or at an earlier date or dates at the Companys behest.
The Perpetual Debenture Stock is also governed by a trust deed and is redeemable at par only on the security becoming enforceable.
The Board does not therefore consider the repayment of these debenture stocks as a likely short-term liquidity issue.
At 31 December 2010 the Company had 205 million outstanding commitments to private equity investments, payable over more than one year see note 24 c. The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 2010 Current liabilities Overdrafts 69,412 69,412 Other borrowings 102,251 102,251 Other creditors 3,480 3,480 Long-term liabilities Debentures 110,575 110,575 175,143 110,575 285,718 2009 Current liabilities Overdrafts 3,942 3,942 Other borrowings Other creditors 4,896 4,896 Long-term liabilities Debentures 110,575 110,575 8,838 110,575 119,413 60 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC
