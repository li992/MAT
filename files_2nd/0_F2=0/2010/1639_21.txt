Overview Notes to the consolidated financial statements Business review Corporate Governance Financial statements 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 28.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents adjusted profit before tax on the face of the Consolidated income statement disclosing those material items of operating income and expense which materially impact the underlying performance of the business.
Historically these items have included amortisation of intangible assets, share-based payments and restructuring costs.
From 2009 10, the Group has chosen to also adjust for the gain loss on the fair value of foreign currency contracts because this is a non-cash item and has become material due to the volatility of the underlying exchange rates.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods in assessing trends in financial performance.
a Statement of compliance The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2010.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and are included on pages 82 to 86. b Basis of consolidation The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation.
Adjustments are made to translate any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRSs.
Inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
c Adoption of new and revised standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year.
The other pronouncements which came into force during the year were not relevant to the Group.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Revised The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 which clarifies the definition of vesting conditions and prescribes the treatment for an award that is cancelled.
The Group adopted this amendment as of 1 January 2009.
It did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
Fair value measurements related to items recorded at fair value are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value.
In addition, a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance for level 3 fair value measurements is now required, as well as significant transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy.
The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures with respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity management.
The fair value measurement disclosures are presented in note 24 e. The liquidity risk disclosures are not significantly impacted by the amendments and are presented in note 24 c. IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 replaced lAS 14 Segment Reporting upon its effective date.
The Group concluded that the operating segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 are the same as the business segments previously identified under lAS 14.
IFRS 8 disclosures are shown in note 6, including the related revised comparative information.
lAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
The Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity includes only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner changes in equity presented in a reconciliation of each component of equity.
In addition, the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements.
The Group has elected to present two statements.

indd 25 01 06 2010 16:42:54 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation continued c Adoption of new and revised standards continued Improvements to IFRSs In May 2008 and April 2009 the IASB issued an omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
The adoption of the following amendments resulted in changes to accounting policies and disclosures but did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group: IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations: IFRS 8 Operating Segment Information: lAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: and lAS 18 Revenue.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised and lAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Amended IFRS 3 Revised introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations.
The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
However, the Group has decided to adopt this standard early.
During the year the Group recognised the benefit of tax losses of 500,000 attributable to an acquisition completed in a previous period.
The impact is included within the current income tax expense.
Had the standard not been adopted early, an adjustment to goodwill would have been required.
Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interests, the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of a contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages.
These changes impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs and future reported results.
lAS 27 Amended requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners.
Therefore, such transactions no longer give rise to goodwill, nor does it give rise to a gain or loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The changes by IFRS 3 Revised and lAS 27 Amended will affect future acquisitions or loss of control of subsidiaries and transactions with non-controlling interests.
New standards and interpretations not yet effective During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standard which is expected to have implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group or which will require additional disclosures in future financial years: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement This is the first part of a new standard to replace IAS 39.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost and fair value.
All equity instruments are measured at fair value.
A debt instrument is at amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest.
Otherwise it is at fair value through profit or loss.
Published by the IASB in November 2009, this is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard is not yet endorsed by the European Union.
3 Significant accounting estimates The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: a Defined benefit pension schemes The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied are described in note 26 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the amount of the Groups future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs.
The carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2010 was 13,082,000 2009 8,764,000.
4 Summary of significant accounting policies a Revenue The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser extent, indirectly through resellers.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes.
It comprises of initial licence fees, annual fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until: a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced: delivery has been made in accordance with that contract: if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met: and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.

indd 26 01 06 2010 16:42:54 Overview Business review Corporate Governance Financial statements 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued a Revenue continued Initial annual licence agreements Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is charged every year.
Annual fees consist of the right to use and customer support and maintenance, which includes core product upgrades and enhancements and remote support services.
Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract, which is typically twelve months.
If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, are non-cancellable and consist of two separate components, the right to use and customer support and maintenance.
Revenue in respect of the customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customer.
This component is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The residual amount representing the right to use element is recognised upfront, provided all of the above criteria have been met.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model, a basket of tokens representing licences to use the software over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on actual number of tokens used.
Services Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training and are performed on a time and material basis under separate service arrangements.
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed.
b Foreign currencies The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is Pounds Sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date, and their Income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
c Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition when a business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised, the Group recognises the deferred tax income in the Consolidated income statement.
d Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to each class of intangible assets as set out below.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the Consolidated income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.

indd 27 01 06 2010 16:42:54 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued d Intangible assets continued Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset, which are as follows: Years Developed technology 512 Customer relationships 20 Other software 3 Purchased software rights 510 e Research expenditure Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful economic life of the asset as follows: Years Computer equipment 3 Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 68 Motor vehicles 4 Leasehold improvements are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease 3 to 49 years or useful economic life, if shorter.
g Impairment of assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement in the administrative expenses line item.
h Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the Consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
j Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the year and therefore all forward foreign exchange contracts have been marked-to-market and are held at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet with any movements being recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
Fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
k Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

indd 28 01 06 2010 16:42:54 Overview Business review Corporate Governance Financial statements 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued l Taxation Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised: except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance sheet date.
The income tax effects of items recorded in either other comprehensive income or equity are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income or the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity respectively.
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except: where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the Consolidated balance sheet.
m Post retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden and Germany.
The Group also provides certain post employment benefits to its South Korean employees.
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002.
UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
The German unfunded defined benefit scheme is closed to new applicants and provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992 by Tribon.
No current employees participate in the scheme.
Full provision has been made for the liability on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a fair and reasonable basis.
Therefore the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit schemes, the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation.
The retirement benefit liability in the Consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate derived from a published index of AA rated corporate bonds as reduced by the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
The current service cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an employee benefit expense.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as finance revenue and finance costs respectively.

indd 29 01 06 2010 16:42:55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued m Post retirement benefits continued Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and non-UK employees.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
n Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, further details of which are given in note 27.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of AVEVA Group plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share, subject to an estimate of whether performance conditions will be met.
o Employee benefit trust The Group has established an employee benefit trust AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 which is a separately administered trust and is funded by loans from Group companies.
The assets of the trust comprise shares in AVEVA Group plc and cash balances.
The Group recognises assets and liabilities of the trust in the Consolidated financial statements and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.

indd 30 01 06 2010 16:42:55 Overview Business review Corporate Governance Financial statements 6 Segment information For management purposes the Group is organised into three geographical segments known as Sales divisions: Asia Pacific: Americas: and Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA.
On 1 April 2009, Central, Eastern and Southern CES Europe Sales division and Western Europe, Middle East and Africa WEMEA Sales division were merged to form EMEA.
Comparatives have been restated to reflect this change.
Each segment is determined by the location of the Groups operations and is organised and managed separately due to the differing local requirements in each market.
Sales divisions are granted distribution rights to license the Groups software to customers in their respective territories.
The segments identified under IFRS 8 are unchanged from those previously identified under IAS 14.
The Executive Board, comprising of the Chief Executive, Finance Director, Head of Group Operations, Head of Product Development and Head of Human Resources, monitors the operating results of the Sales divisions for the purposes of making decisions about performance assessment and resource allocation.
Sales division performance is evaluated based on profit before tax using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Groups financial statements.
There is no inter-segment revenue.
Balance sheet information is not included in the information provided to the Executive Board.
Support functions such as product development and head office departments are controlled and monitored centrally.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 27.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as follows: Asia Pacific EMEA Americas Total Year ended 31 March 2010 000 000 000 000 On the acquisition of: Tribon Solutions AB 8,576 6,892 356 15,824 Realitywave Inc. 260 520 260 1,040 AEA Technology 108 976 1,084 Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha 229 229 9,173 7,412 1,592 18,177 Asia Pacific EMEA Americas Total Year ended 31 March 2009 restated 000 000 000 000 Tribon Solutions AB 7,934 6,377 327 14,638 Realitywave Inc. 276 552 276 1,104 AEA Technology 108 976 1,084 Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha 229 229 8,547 6,929 1,579 17,055 The comparatives for 31 March 2009 have been restated to reflect the merger of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe and Western Europe, Middle East and Africa Sales divisions into one Sales division known as Europe, Middle East and Africa.

indd 35 01 06 2010 16:42:55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 15 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on managements estimates of growth in those specific markets based on past experience and external market information.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the year ending 31 March 2011 and extrapolates cash flows for future years based on an average estimated growth rate of 2% for each CGU 2009 2%, representing the long term average growth rate for the Groups CGUs.
Future cash flows are discounted in line with the weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10% pre-tax 2009 10%.
Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.

These leases have a duration of between one and five years.
Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
24 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been, throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds, and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
During the year the treasury policy was amended to enable the Group to put treasury deposits in place with a maturity of up to six months.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
The Group does not have any significant borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rate would have reduced interest income by approximately 670,000 2009 1,033,000 and profit after tax by 480,000 2009 738,000.

indd 39 01 06 2010 16:42:55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Financial risk management continued a Market risk continued Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US Dollar and Euro reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research and Development, are settled in Sterling and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages these exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts and currency options for the sale of US Dollar and Euro as appropriate.
During the year the Group has started to use forward exchange contracts for Japanese Yen.
The Group enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
In addition, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euro to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
These are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
At 31 March 2010, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $24.5 million 2009 $23.5 million, 12.8 million 2009 15.2 million and JPY 120 million 2009 JPY nil.
In addition, in previous periods, the Group has utilised option instruments which included various provisions that, depending on the spot rate at maturity, give either the Group or the counterparty the option to exercise.
At 31 March 2010, the Group had outstanding currency options under which the Group may, under certain circumstances, be required to sell up to $nil million 2009 $10.5 million.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
There is currently no requirement for borrowings and therefore this risk is not managed through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2008 09.

indd 40 01 06 2010 16:42:55 Overview Business review Corporate Governance Financial statements 24 Financial risk management continued b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables.
Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit of 50 million as set out in the Groups treasury policy.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 19. c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no significant borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.

The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition the Groups financial liabilities also include forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The 3 levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 March 2010 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
The estimation of the fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts is 1,033,000 at 31 March 2010 2009 liability of 4,643,000.
The resulting gain of 3,610,000 2009 loss of 3,737,000 on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in the Consolidated income statement under administrative expenses.
f Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising of issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2009 or 2010.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2010 2009 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 1,426 1,589 Deferred tax assets 5,016 5,514 3,590 3,925 At the Balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 5,072,000 2009 3,810,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 1,584,000 2009 1,287,000, nil 2009 580,000 has been recognised and is included in other above.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the balance due to the unpredictability of future profit streams, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the Balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 23,300,000 2009 38,800,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemptions but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by AVEVA Group plc to its shareholders.

This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 with the option of re-opening if required and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004.
Pensions are payable to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.
There is an insurance policy in place which covers this liability.
Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a Trust Deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary, BDO Stoy Hayward Investment Management Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The employees contributions are fixed as a percentage of salary, the balance being made up by the employer.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective Balance sheet dates.
To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows: 2010 2009 % % Main assumptions: Rate of salary increases 5.70 5.10 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.40 3.00 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 3.70 3.10 Discount rate 5.50 6.60 Inflation assumption 3.70 3.10 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 6.65 7.15 Bonds 4.00 3.70 Other 0.50 0.50 For the years ended 31 March 2010 and 2009, the following weighted average life expectancy at age 65 for mortality has been used: 2010 2009 Years Years Male pensioners 24.1 23.8 Female pensioners 26.6 26.4 Non-retired males 2 7.0 26.7 Non-retired females 28.9 28.5 Member contributions were 7.5% 2009 7.5% of pensionable salary and Company contributions were 2,239,000 2009 1,877,000.
The total contributions in 2011 are expected to be approximately 2,069,000.
The assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Impact on deficit increase decrease 2010 2009 000 000 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 2,227 1,475 inflation including pension increases linked to inflation 1,332 845 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 860 586 The assets and liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2010 and 2009 were as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Equities 30,189 18,379 Bonds 9,298 6,976 Other 1,249 3,336 Total fair value of assets 40,736 28,691 Present value of scheme liabilities 52,428 36,313 Net pension liability 11,692 7,622 AVEVA Group plc Financial statements Group Annual report 2010 72 2 AVE ar10 back.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income of 8,500,000 in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income before 1 April 2004.

Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992.
No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
Benefit payments are made as they fall due.
The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee.
This scheme is closed to new members.
Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below: 2010 2009 Rate of increase of pension in payment 1.50%2.50% 1.75%2.50% Discount rate 5.30%6.20% 5.50%6.20% Mortality 13 years 14 years Rate of salary increases 0%2.50% 0%2.50% The retirement age for the Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH schemes was 60 and 63 years of age respectively 2009 60 and 63 years of age.

The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance company.
It is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component.
AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee.
AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension scheme.
At 31 March 2010, Alectas surplus in the form of collective funding level was 143% 2009 122% which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies.
The total cost charged to income was 741,000 2009 545,000. e Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, Norwegian and Asian employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The total cost charged to income of 1,844,000 2009 2,002,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.

The average fair value of options granted during the year was 6.84 2009 14.13.
In calculating the fair value, the expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was nil to 0.03 2009 nil to 2.65.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1,184,000 and 940,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the years ended 31 March 2010 and 2009 respectively.
Details of the share option plans are as follows: a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The following awards have been made under the LTIP.
The exercise price is equal to the nominal value of the underlying shares, which is 3.33 pence.
Options under the LTIP are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
2009 10 awards On 7 July 2009, a total of 137,839 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP.

All shares under this option shall vest if average diluted earnings per share for the three years ending 31 March 2012 is equal to or above 52.14 pence.
Should average diluted earnings per share for the period be below 52.14 pence, then no shares will vest and the option will lapse.
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
