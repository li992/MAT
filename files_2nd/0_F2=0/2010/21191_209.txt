Financial statements IFRS 227 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 22 Fair value methodology This note explains the methodology for valuing our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, and provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.
a Basis for determining fair value hierarchy of financial instruments For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, we have categorised the measurement basis into a fair value hierarchy as follows: Quoted market prices in active markets Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Examples are listed equities in active markets, listed debt securities in active markets and quoted unit trusts in active markets.
Modelled with significant observable market inputs Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar i. e. not identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment spreads, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates.
Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means marketcorroborated inputs.
Examples of these are securities measured using discounted cash flow models based on market observable swap yields, and listed debt or equity securities in a market that is inactive.
Valuations, whether sourced from internal models or third parties incorporate credit risk by adjusting the spread above the yield curve for government treasury securities for the appropriate amount of credit risk for each issuer, based on observed market transactions.
To the extent observed market spreads are either not used in valuing a security, or do not fully reflect liquidity risk, our valuation methodology, whether sourced from internal models or third parties, reflects a liquidity premium.
Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, we generally validate the price quoted by the broker by using internal models with observable inputs.
When the price obtained from the broker and internal model are similar, we look to the inputs used in our internal model to understand the observability of the inputs used by the broker.
In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, and the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
Broker quotes are usually non-binding.
Modelled with significant unobservable market inputs Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date or market information for the inputs to any valuation models.
As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Examples are certain private equity investments and private placements.
The majority of the Groups financial assets and certain financial liabilities are valued based on quoted market information or observable market data.
A small percentage 4.5% of total financial assets recorded at fair value are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Third-party valuations using significant unobservable inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the third-party price and the internally modelled value.
Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2.

For the year to 31 December 2010, transfers of financial assets from fair value hierarchy Level 1 to Level 2 amounted to 517 million 2009: 886 million, and from Level 2 to Level 1 amounted to 289 million 2009: 2,181 million.
The transfers arose as a result of changes in the level of activity in the markets from which prices are sourced, as well as changes in the pricing sources used in France to value certain financial investments.
The latter has not given rise to a change in pricing methodology.
For the year to 31 December 2010, there were no transfers of financial liabilities between fair value hierarchy levels except for the transfer of 2,305 million securitised borrowings in our business in the Netherlands, which have moved from Level 2 to Level 1 as a result of increased market activity.

The effect is to increase equity and debt securities by 2,085 million and 1,247 million respectively and decrease unit trusts and other investment vehicles within other investments by 3,332 million.
Except for 50 million equity securities considered Level 3, which were previously treated as Level 1 when classified as other investments, there is no effect on the fair value hierarchy as a result of the change in presentation.

Transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are deemed to have occurred at the assessment date.
Transfers into and out of Level 3 arose for the following reasons: Changes in the market observability of valuation inputs.
Changes in the market observability of inputs used to validate valuations.
Significant differences between third-party prices used for valuations and validation prices either sourced from third parties or internal models.
The principal transfers out of Level 3 in 2010, are: The transfer of 0.65 billion Italian structured bonds, which were classified as Level 3 in 2009 because of significant differences between the third-party counterparty price used to value the bonds and the internal model valuation using observable market inputs, which was used to validate the counterparty price.
Except for 55 million of structured bonds, which remain in Level 3, the third-party and internal-modelled valuations have not shown any significant differences on a monthly basis since January 2010.
Consequently the bonds have been transferred to Level 2.
The transfer of 0.31 billion debt securities in our UK business, for which either new valuation models have been developed or there has been sufficient market activity in observable inputs to justify a Level 2 classification.
The transfers into Level 3 in 2010 are spread across our businesses in the UK, Italy, US, the Netherlands and France and across a number of asset classes, with no single business or asset class predominating.
There are a variety of reasons for these transfers including insufficient market activity in valuation inputs, greater transparency of valuation inputs from third-party pricing sources and open investment funds becoming closed.
Of the 247 million net gains 2009: 52 million net losses recognised in the income statement during the year, 252 million gain 2009: 2 million gain relates to net investment income and 5 million loss 2009: 54 million loss relating to impairments is included in other expenses.
230 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 22 Fair value methodology continued ii The principal investments classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are: Structured bond-type products held by our businesses in France and Italy amounting to 6.49 billion and 0.06 billion respectively, for which there is no active market.
These bonds are valued either using third-party counterparty or broker quotes.
These bonds are validated against internal or third-party models.
Most of these bonds have been classified as Level 3 because either i the third-party models included a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment or ii differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation model were sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification.
At 31 December 2010, the counterparty and broker quotes used to value these products were less than the modelled valuations.
Notes issued by loan partnerships held by our UK Life business amounting to 1.2 billion, for which there is no active market.
These are valued using counterparty quotes, corroborated against the prices of selected similar securities.
In 2010, there were insufficient market observable transactions in the selected securities to provide a reliable proxy price to corroborate the counterparty price.
In addition, our UK Life business owns part of the residual equity interest in these loan partnerships valued at 0.2 billion according to net asset values, which are not considered market observable, resulting in a Level 3 classification.
Private equity investment funds amounting to 1.4 billion, of which 0.9 billion is held by our UK business.
In valuing our interest in these funds, we rely on investment valuation reports received from the fund manager, making adjustments for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions between the date of the report and the balance sheet date and the fund managers carried interest.
In addition, an indexation adjustment is made to reflect changes in appropriate equity market indices between the valuation report date and balance sheet date.
External hedge funds held principally by businesses in the UK, US and France amounting to 1.1 billion.
Valuations received from fund managers are based on net asset values.
However, insufficient information is provided on the underlying fund assets to support a classification other than Level 3.
Certain direct private equity investments and private placements held by our business in the Netherlands and strategic interests in banking partners held by our Italian business amounting to 0.9 billion.
Valuations are based on third-party independent appraisals, or where internally modelled, transactions in similar entities, discounted cash flow techniques and valuation multiples, using public and internal management information.
Other Level 3 investments amount to 1.0 billion and relate to a diverse range of different types of securities held by a number of businesses throughout the Group.
iii Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 investments to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives.
95% 2009: 91% of valuations for Level 3 investments are sourced from independent third parties and, where appropriate, validated against internally-modelled valuations, third-party models or broker quotes.
Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis: For third-party valuations validated against internally-modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.
For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input.
Sensitivities are determined by flexing to a reasonable alternative the yield, NAV multiple, IRR or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation.
For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the securitys contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.
On the basis of the methodology outlined above, the Group is able to perform sensitivity analysis for 4.5 billion of the Groups Level 3 investments.
For these Level 3 investments, changing unobservable valuation inputs to a reasonable alternative would result in a change in fair value in the range of 367 million positive impact and 366 million adverse impact.
Of the 7.9 billion Level 3 investments for which sensitivity analysis is not provided, 0.1 billion and 7.2 billion relate to investments held in unit-linked and participating funds respectively in Spain and France.
For these products investment risk is predominantly borne by policyholders, and therefore shareholder profit before tax is insensitive to reasonable changes in fair value of these investments.
Level 3 investments backing non-linked shareholder-backed business, for which no sensitivity analysis is provided, amounts to only 0.6 billion.
A 10% change in valuation of these investments would reduce shareholder profit before tax by 64 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, we reported that changing one or more unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative would not have had a significant impact on the fair value of financial investments carried at fair value.
