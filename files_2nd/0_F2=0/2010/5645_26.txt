The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

BP Labels, based in Cardiff, UK, is a manufacturer of high quality, creative and secure self-adhesive labels and is highly complementary with Filtronas Coated & Security Products division.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the business acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Filtrona.
The fair value adjustments are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
BP Labels contributed 2.8m to revenue and 0.1m to operating profit before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2010 after deducting acquisition expenses of 0.1m.

Stera Tape, based in Bridlington, UK, is a manufacturer of high quality speciality adhesive tapes and is highly complementary to Duraco, a business within Filtronas Protection & Finishing Products division.

The adjustment to deferred tax is the tax affect of recognising customer relationships and other intangibles.
Payables and inventories were reassessed to their fair value.
Deferred contingent consideration of 0.3m is payable by the Group if BP Labels exceeds a targeted revenue and gross profit margin in the period of 12 months to 30 April 2011.
Included in the 5.8m of goodwill recognised above is the value of the unique revenue and cost synergies and an assembled workforce.
Due to its nature this asset cannot be individually identified or measured.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Stera Tape and BP Labels had been completed on 1 January 2010 the contribution to 2010 Group revenue would have been 9.7m and to Group operating profit before intangible amortisation would have been 1.4m.
On 2 March 2009, Filtrona received notification that ITO Technologies ApS ITO wished to exercise its put option over 20% of the share capital of FractureCode Corporation ApS under a share purchase agreement dated 22 December 2005 between ITO, FIL International Limited, Filtrona and Jens Jacob Juul Rasmussen.
The cash consideration was 3.1m which was recorded directly to equity as acquisition of non-controlling interests.
Discontinued operations On 27 March 2009, Filtrona completed the disposal of its North American Plastic Profile & Sheet business Filtrona Extrusion to Saw Mill Capital Partners, L. P. for an initial gross consideration of 59.2m.
The disposal resulted in a loss before tax of 8.6m which was recognised as discontinued operations in the income statement.
On 22 June 2010, Filtrona received further consideration of 8.7m from Saw Mill Capital LLC for the settlement of an earn-out in relation to the disposal.
The settlement resulted in a profit after tax of 6.8m which has been recognised as discontinued operations in the income statement.

Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Filtrona plc is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss account and cash flow statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, because the published consolidated financial statements of the Group include disclosures which comply with the Standard.
The following principal accounting policies have been consistently applied.
b Investment in subsidiary undertaking Investment in subsidiary undertaking is held at cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether the investment in its subsidiary has been impaired.
c Share-based payments The fair value of share options is measured at grant date.
It is recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work over the expected period between grant and vesting date of the options, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
d Own shares The shares held in the Filtrona Employee Benefit Trust for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of share incentive plans are treated as belonging to the Company and are deducted from its retained earnings.
The cost of shares held directly treasury shares is also deducted from retained earnings.
e Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders of the Company final dividend or paid interim dividend.
f Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Exchange differences arising from movements in spot rates are included in the profit and loss account as exchange gains or losses, while those arising from the interest differential elements of forward currency contracts are included in external interest income or expense.
g Financial instruments Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value.
The subsequent measurement depends on the classification of the financial instrument.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings and other financial liabilities excluding derivatives are held at amortised cost.
i Financial instruments which hedge net investment in foreign operations of the parent undertaking The Company holds financial instruments which hedge the net investments in the foreign operations of its subsidiary undertakings.
Since the Company does not hold the underlying investments, gains and losses on these instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account.
