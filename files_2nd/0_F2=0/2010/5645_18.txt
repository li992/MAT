The service contracts for the Executive Directors are available for inspection by members at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Companys registered office.
The Remuneration Committees policy in relation to termination of service contracts is to apply an appropriate level of mitigation, having regard to all of the circumstances of the individual and the termination of employment, and to any legal advice received.
The Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice, which includes salary all executives and bonus for Mark Harper and Steve Crummett, and any such payment may be made in monthly instalments at the Companys discretion and may be reduced to take into account any sums earned during the payment period by way of employment elsewhere.
