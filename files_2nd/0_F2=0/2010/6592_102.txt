The main externally funded defined benefit pension schemes operate in the UK, US and Japan.
In europe, funds are retained within certain businesses to provide defined benefit pension benefits.
In addition, in the US and UK a number of retirement plans are operated which provide certain employees with post-employment medical benefits.
1M3 26 Post-employment obligations continued a Defined benefit schemes measurement and assumptions Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2M1M.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Key assumptions were: uK Americas Europe ROW % % % % 2010 rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.35 3.5 2.50 rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 2.90 2.0 1.75 n a Discount rate 5.40 5.5 5.00 1.75 Inflation assumption 3.35 2.5 1.75 0.75 rate of increases in medical costs: Initial long term 6.5 6.0 9.0 5.0 n a n a 2MM9 rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.25 3.5 2.5M 3.5 rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.4M 2.

M n a n a The discount rates in the table above for the UK and europe were referenced against specific iBoxx indices, whilst the Citigroup liability index was the reference point for the USa discount rate.
The reference for the UK discount rate was the yield as at 31 December on the iBoxx GBp Corporate rated aa bonds with a maturity of 15 years plus.
The reference for the european discount rate was the yield as at 31 December on the iBoxx euro Corporate rated aa bonds with a maturity of 1M years plus of 4.7%, adjusted to reflect the duration of liabilities.
For the USa, the discount rate matched the Citigroup liability index as at 31 December 2M1M of 5.5%.
The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes are as follows: United Kingdom Such is the size and profile of the UK scheme that data on the schemes mortality experience is collected and reviewed annually.
The key current year mortality assumptions for the scheme use S1Na year of birth mortality tables allowing for medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% and a M. 5 age rating for male members and a M. 7 year age rating for female members.
Using these assumptions a male aged 65 lives for a further 2M.
6 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 23.2 years.
a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 22.5 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 25.1 years from age 65.
The prior period valuation used pa92 year of birth tables allowing for medium cohort but without a minimum improvement.
The prior period age adjustments to pa92 year of birth tables were equivalent to that of the age rating adjustment to S1Na year of birth tables.
Overseas In the USa, ppa2M1M tables have been used whilst in Germany the rT2MM5-G tables have again been used.
In the USa the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 19 years female 21 years whilst in Germany a male aged 65 lives for a further 18.1 years female 22.4 years.
The longevity assumption for a USa male currently aged 45 is that he also lives for a further 19 years once attaining 65 years female 21 years, with the German equivalent assumption for a male being 18.2 years female 23.6 years.
These assumptions are based solely on the prescribed tables not on actual GKN experience.

equity returns are developed based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt, as appropriate to the plans holdings of these instruments, all other asset classes returns are determined by reference to current experience.
The pension partnership interest has been valued on a discounted cash flow basis.
The valuation considered separately the profiles of the originating royalty and rental income streams using the Groups current budget and forecast data with other factors considered being related expenses including taxation, timing of the distributions, exchange rates, bond yields and the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
