Notes to the CoNsolidated FiNaNCial statemeNts CoNtiNued 2 segmentAl AnAlysis the analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with iFRs 8 Operating segments, on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board the chief operating Decision maker as defined by iFRs 8, as follows: civil aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
marine development, manufacture, marketing and sales of marine propulsion systems and aftermarket services.
energy development, manufacture, marketing and sales of power systems for the offshore oil and gas industry and electrical power generation and aftermarket services.
engineering and technology, operations and services discussed in the business review operate on a group-wide basis across all the above segments.
the operating results are prepared on an underlying basis that excludes items considered to be non-underlying in nature.
the principles adopted are: underlying revenues Where revenues are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the group undertaking, these reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on settled derivative contracts and exclude the release of the foreign exchange transition hedging reserve.
there is no inter-segment trading and hence all revenues are from external customers.
underlying profit before financing Where transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the group undertaking, this reflects the transactions at the achieved exchange rates on settled derivative contracts and excludes the release of the foreign exchange transition hedging reserve.
underlying profit before taxation in addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing: includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts.
excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by iAs 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, changes in value of financial RRsp contracts arising from changes in forecast payments and the net impact of financing costs related to post-employment scheme benefits.
