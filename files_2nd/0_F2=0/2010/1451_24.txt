The 2010 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies and double tax relief partially offset by a benefit of $342m arising from a number of tax settlements including the UK matters described in Note 25 and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2009 and 2008 prior period current tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments, an increase in provisions in respect of a number of transfer pricing audits and double tax relief.
The 2010 prior period deferred tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and a reclassification from deferred tax to current tax of amounts provided in relation to tax contingencies for prior periods.
The 2009 and 2008 prior year deferred tax adjustments relate to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and the recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double tax relief if distributed as dividends.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $16,768m at 31 December 2010 2009: $14,846m: 2008: $8,449m.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group involved in worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
It is the UK Governments intention to enact legislation which will reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 24% by 2014.
In November 2010, the UK Government also released a consultation document providing details on a proposed programme of corporate tax reforms including the introduction of apatent box regime.
Details of material tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 25.

6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
Our pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
Allof these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
We do not manage these individual functional areas separately.
We consider that the SET is AstraZenecas chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in theform of, and on the same basis as, the Groups IFRS Financial Statements.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and research and development resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Groups Portfolio Investment Board to facilitate a Group-wide single combined discovery and development strategy.
Geographic areas The tables below show information by geographic area and, for revenue and property, plant and equipment, material countries.
The figures show the revenue, operating profit and profit before tax made by companies located in that area country, together with segment assets, segment assets acquired, net operating assets and property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies: export sales and the related profit are included in the area country from which those sales were made.
Intra-Group pricing is determined on an arms length basis.

The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Groups pre-tax cash flows over 10 years, aperiod reflecting the average patent-protected lives of our current products.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of the populations in ourestablished markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets, our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10 year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use.
No terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects.
For each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2010: 7.6% for 2009: 7.6% for 2008 to reflect the impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 10% 11% for 2009: 11% for 2008.
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 31December 2010 and 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied.
The Directors have concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

The 2010 impairment of other intangibles chiefly results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine.
The 2009 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the termination of development projects during the year.
The 2009 impairment of other intangibles results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine and a reassessment of other future licensing and contractual income expected to be earned within our biologics business.
The 2008 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results, in part, from the settlement of the Pulmicort Respules patent litigation with Teva $115m and the at risk launch of a generic competitor to Ethyol $257m.
The 2008 impairment of other intangibles results from areassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine.
These impairment charges were determined using value in use calculations applying the same considerations as above.
The remaining $144m impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the termination of projects in development during the year.
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of research and development activities, were determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products expected cash flows over a period reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products.
The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2010: 7.6% for 2009: 7.6% for 2008 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.

3 Includes derivatives not designated in hedge relationships or related to financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss, and contingent consideration arising on business combinations Note 22.
Other financial assets represent trade and other receivables Note 12 excluding prepayments and accrued income.
Other financial liabilities represent trade and other payables Note 16 excluding deferred income.
Credit risk increased the fair value of the bonds designated as fair value through profit or loss by $5m for the year and increased the fair value by $40m since designation.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Groups Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $1,037m.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments together with their carrying values are as follows: Cash and overdrafts held on the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised costs.
Fair value approximates to carrying value.
Loans due within one year and after more than one year the fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year-end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments consists of interest rate swaps included in designated as fair value through profit or loss if related to debt designated at fair value, or instruments in a hedge relationship as a fair value hedge or other derivatives and forward foreign exchange contracts included in other derivatives.
All derivatives are held at fair value.
Interest rate swaps the fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates current at year end.
Forward foreign exchange contracts the majority of contracts for existing transactions had maturities of six months or less from year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
Other investments held on the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
These include equity securities held on the consolidated statement of financial position as other investments Note 10.
The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
Unlisted investments are held at cost which approximates to fair value.
Other financial assets and other financial liabilities with the exception of contingent consideration which is held at fair value see Note 22, other financial assets and liabilities are held on the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised costs with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2010 Financial Statements 159 Financial Statements 15 Financial instruments continued The interest rates used to discount future cash flows, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were asfollows: 2010 2009 2008 Derivatives 0.7% to 4.0% 2.0% to 4.6% 3.8% to 4.6% Loans and borrowings 0.7% to 4.0% 2.0% to 4.6% 3.8% to 4.6% Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices orindirectly ie derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2010 Financial Statements 161 Financial Statements 18 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where AstraZenecas contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over one, three or five years.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate,  funds.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZenecas credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency of the relevant pension scheme.
Financing Principles 96.5% of the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2010 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany.
In these countries the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles: The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
The pension funds are not part of the Groups core business.
The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
The Group would not wish toamend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be shortterm volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZenecas business at the present date: should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles.
This determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities.
To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations are basedonthe expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield.
At present this puts a different value on the liabilities than IAS 19.
UK With regard to the Groups UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
The most recent full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2008.
Under the agreed funding principles for the UK, cash contributions will be paid to the fund to target a level of assets in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to an escrow account which will be held outside of the pension fund.
The escrow account assets will be payable to the fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long term investment strategy.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date was 2,994m $5,951m equivalent, representing 87% of the funds actuarially assessed liabilities as valued in accordance with the funds technical provisions.
The escrow fund held an additional 33m $65m at the valuation date.
During 2009, it was agreed to fund the shortfall by making a transfer of current escrow assets to the fund and by establishing a new funding schedule, making regular payments over seven years in the region of 42m per annum to the escrow and 132m per annum to the fund.
This includes the contributions required to meet the benefits accruing in the region of 60m per annum.
In addition, 90m per annum is being paid to the escrow for two years until the next valuation to cover the losses on the funds investments since the valuation date as a result of the market downturn.
At 31 December 2010, 230m $355m escrow fund assets are included within other investments see Note 10.
Under the agreed funding principles, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2008 for contributions to both the fund and escrow account are as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 3.5% per annum, salary increases at 3.5% per annum, pension increases at 3.5% per annum and investment returns at 7.1% per annum pre-retirement and 5.96% per annum post-retirement.
During the first half of 2010, AstraZeneca consulted with its UK employees representatives on proposals to freeze pensionable pay at 30June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK pension fund.
The defined benefit fund remains open to existing members and employees who choose to leave the defined benefit fund will retain a deferred pension in addition to being offered membership in a new Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan.
The amendment to the UK defined benefit fund to freeze pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels represents an accounting curtailment of certain pension obligations.
The majority of members opted to remain in the defined benefit fund and continue benefit accrual with frozen pensionable pay.
In accordance with IAS 19, the scheme obligations were revalued by the scheme actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date.
The resulting credit of $693m has been recognised in comprehensive income during the year.
In July 2010, the UK government announced changes to the inflation index used for statutory pension increases both for pensions in payment and pensions in deferment to apply to private sector pension schemes.
This has resulted in a small actuarial gain during the period in respect of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund.
162 Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2010 Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 18 Post-retirement benefits continued Rest of Group The IAS 19 positions as at 31 December 2010 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans.
These plans account for 90% of the Groups defined benefit obligations outside of the UK.
These plans are funded in line with the financing principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2010, when plan obligations were $1,757m and plan assets were $1,525m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2010, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $1,338m and plan assets were $809m.
The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2010, when plan obligations amounted to $241m and plan assets were $25m.
On current bases, it is expected that contributions excluding those in respect of past service cost during the year ended 31 December 2011 to the four main countries will be $342m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2010, some 3,973 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 11,267 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2010 was $18m 2009: $19m: 2008: $21m.
Plan assets were $272m andplan obligations were $310m at 31 December 2010.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits underIAS 19.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2010.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the scheme, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2010 2009 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.6% 2.3% 3.5% 2.3% 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.4% 4.5% 3.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.5% 0.9% 3.5% 0.9% Discount rate 5.5% 4.9% 5.5% 5.0% Long-term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 8.0% 7.9% 8.0% 8.1% Bonds 5.1% 5.0% 5.5% 5.2% Others 6.1% 4.7% 6.5% 4.8% Rate of increase in medical costs initial rate 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 1 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
The expected return on assets is determined with reference to the expected long-term level of dividends, interest and other returns derived from the plan assets, together with realised and unrealised gains or losses on the plan assets, less any costs of administering the plan, less any tax payable by the plan.
The expected returns are based on long-term market expectations and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that any sustained movements in underlying markets are reflected.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2010 and members expected to retire in 2030.

The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

22 Acquisitions of business operations Novexel On 3 March 2010, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Novexel S. A. Novexel is a research company focused on the infection therapy area and is based in France.
This acquisition strengthens our research capabilities in the infection therapy area.
AstraZeneca acquired one hundred percent of Novexels shares for an upfront consideration of $427m.
Additional consideration of up to $75m will become payable to Novexel shareholders on the completion of certain development milestones.
At both the date of acquisition and at 31 December 2010, the fair value of this contingent consideration was $50m.
For both the period since acquisition and the full year, Novexel had no revenues and its loss was immaterial.

These antibiotic combinations utilise Novexels novel investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor NXL-104 to overcome antibiotic resistance and treat the increasing number of infections resistant to existing therapies.
In addition, Forest acquired rightsto CAZ-104 in North America and bought down payment obligations to Novexel in relation to CEF-104 from previous existing licence arrangements.
In consideration for these rights, Forest paid Novexel, then an AstraZeneca group company, a sum of $210m on 3 March 2010 and will also pay additional sums equivalent to half of any future specified development milestone payments that become payable by AstraZeneca.
This consideration is equivalent to the fair value attributed on acquisition to those assets and hence there is no profit impact from this divestment.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and options, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note 20, debt Note 14 and cash Note 13.
For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Boards distribution policy comprises both a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2010 adopted a progressive dividend policy, whereby the Board intends to maintain or grow the dividend each year, targeting an average dividend cover of two times ie a payout ratio of 50%, based on reported earnings, before restructuring costs.
In addition, after providing for business investment, funding the progressive dividend policy and meeting debt service obligations, the Board will regularly assess the opportunity to return cash in excess of these requirements to shareholders through share repurchases.
The Groups net funds position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments has increased from $535m at the beginning of the year to a net funds position of $3,653m at 31 December 2010 as a result of strong net operating cash inflows.
Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Groups current long-term credit rating is A1 by Moodys and AAby Standard and Poors, both with a stable outlook.
168 Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2010 Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $11,068m, fixed deposits of $1,107m less overdrafts of $87m at 31 December 2010, the Group has committed bank facilities of $4.25bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31 December 2010, the Group has issued $1,528m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $7,569m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities consist of $3.6bn maturing in October 2012, and $0.65bn maturing between October and December 2011 and were undrawn at 31December 2010.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Groups financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows: Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative derivative and other and other financial Interest Currency financial loans Bonds payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 128 518 8,640 9,286 120 120 9,166 In one to two years 2,268 373 2,641 121 121 2,520 In two to three years 423 423 87 87 336 In three to four years 1,153 1,153 69 69 1,084 In four to five years 1,379 1,379 50 50 1,329 In more than five years 10,095 10,095 192 192 9,903 128 15,836 9,013 24,977 639 639 24,338 Effect of interest 3 7,012 7,015 639 639 6,376 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 273 273 324 324 51 31 December 2010 125 9,097 9,013 18,235 324 324 17,911 Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative derivative and other and other financial Interest Currency financial loans Bonds payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 139 2,373 8,687 11,199 117 89 28 11,171 In one to two years 523 185 708 117 117 591 In two to three years 2,246 2,246 116 116 2,130 In three to four years 429 429 86 86 343 In four to five years 405 405 64 64 341 In more than five years 12,209 12,209 239 239 11,970 139 18,185 8,872 27,196 739 89 650 26,546 Effect of interest 3 7,467 7,470 739 739 6,731 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 209 209 262 1 261 52 31 December 2009 136 10,927 8,872 19,935 262 90 172 19,763 Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative derivative and other and other financial Interest Currency financial loans Bonds payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 345 1,271 7,178 8,794 60 60 8,734 In one to two years 2,335 61 2,396 60 66 6 2,402 In two to three years 465 465 59 59 406 In three to four years 2,241 2,241 59 59 2,182 In four to five years 424 424 46 46 378 In more than five years 12,478 12,478 163 163 12,315 345 19,214 7,239 26,798 447 66 381 26,417 Effect of interest 2 7,956 7,958 447 447 7,511 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 247 247 449 5 444 197 31 December 2008 343 11,505 7,239 19,087 449 71 378 18,709 Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each year ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune has been held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2010 Financial Statements 169 Financial Statements 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued At 31 December 2010, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $2.5bn, converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2014, and the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2012 and the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2010.
At 31 December 2010 swaps with a notional value of $1.5bn were designated as fair value hedges and swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 142.
The majority of the Groups cash balances are held with third party fund managers with floating rates of interest being earned.
The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2010, 31 December 2009 and 31December 2008 is set out below.
In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 58% of Group external sales in 2010 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally based on forecast cash flows for the currencies of Swedish krona SEK, pounds sterling GBP, euro EUR, Australian dollar AUD, Canadian dollar CAD and Japanese yen JPY.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
As at 31 December 2010, 5.8% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 10.8% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken toprofit.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
Transactional One hundred percent of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
170 Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2010 Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The table below sets out the principal foreign exchange contracts outstanding at 31 December 2010, 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 along with the underlying gross exposure as defined above.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
Forlong-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2010, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2010, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $30m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2010, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening ofthe US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed inthe table below.

Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the2023 debentures and 2014 bonds which are accounted for at fair value through profit and loss.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2010 Financial Statements 171 Financial Statements 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: 2010 2009 2008 $m $m $m US 2,168 2,229 2,032 UK 530 482 459 Sweden 285 245 226 Euro zone countries 878 762 833 Other European countries 290 295 257 Japan 1,091 950 955 Other countries 1,005 819 796 6,247 5,782 5,558 In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73% of US sales 2009: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 81%: 2008: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 81%.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2010 2009 2008 $m $m $m Not past due 5,953 5,542 5,262 Overdue but renegotiated 3 Past due 0-90 days 104 65 106 Past due 90-180 days 67 75 60 Past due 180 days 123 100 127 6,247 5,782 5,558 2010 2009 2008 $m $m $m Movements in provisions for trade receivables Balance at beginning of year 81 99 89 Income statement credit charge 1 20 23 Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements 1 2 13 Balance at end of year 81 81 99 The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers.
Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in AAA-rated liquidity funds, US Treasury bills and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2010 was $8,721m invested in three AAA-rated liquidity funds and $949m invested in US Treasury bills.
The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating.
No more than 10% of fund value is invested within each individual fund.
US Treasury bills bear credit exposure to the US government.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral for the benefit of the other equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2010 was $13m.
The carrying amount of financial assets, being cash and cash equivalents, derivative assets, other investments and other receivables represents the maximum credit exposure.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 and excludes payments under the Merck agreements detailed below.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 96, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
