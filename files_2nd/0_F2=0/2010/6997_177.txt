Share-based payments The Group has three share award plans: 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme CSOS 2.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 5% per year for the 2005 scheme and 3.5% for options granted subsequently.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer Group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
Halfords Sharesave Scheme The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service.
Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations were as follows: 7 August 7 August 7 August 1 August Grant date 2009 2008 2007 2006 Share price at grant date 3.2592 2.4083 4.02 3.01 Exercise price 2.6074 1.9267 3.22 3.01 Number of employees 403 821 1,064 343 Shares under option 305,750 1,491,586 929,890 173,558 Vesting period years 3 3 3 3 Expected volatility 38% 29% 22% 22% Option life years 3 3 3 3 Expected life years 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 Risk free rate 2.74% 4.58% 5.54% 4.75% Expected dividend yield 4.42% 4.83% 4.10% 4.10% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 44% 44% 44% 44% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% 100% Fair value per option 0.95 0.61 1.01 0.44 Expired during the period 26,509 164,908 48,106 12,299 Number of options outstanding at 2 April 2010 279,241 1,167,092 236,576 648 Share options exercised during the period by scheme grant date: 2010 2009 Exercise Number of Number of price shares shares 1 August 2006 3.01 52,135 7 August 2007 3.22 2,436 7 August 2008 1.93 17,562 72,133 17399 14 06 2010 Proof 7 Financials Responsibilities Business Review About Halfords Introduction 126 Notes to the Financial Statements 22.
Performance Share Plan The introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the executive Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Companys performance over the three-year period following the award date.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other 50% by the Companys absolute EPS performance against RPI.
The Companys TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 general retailers as a comparator Group.
No retesting will be permitted.
The TSR element of the options granted under the 2007 scheme has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte.
The Deloitte model uses the Groups share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo model.
For the 2006 scheme the TSR element of the options were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation were as follows: 3 August 7 August 12 July 11 July Grant date 2009 2008 2007 2006 Share price at grant date 3.4583 2.962 4.02 3.01 Number of employees 20 20 21 18 Shares under option 824,927 866,340 539,893 596,908 Shares representing dividends reinvested 12,659 Vesting period years 3 3 3 3 Expected volatility 41% 30% 22% 22% Option life years 3 3 3 3 Expected life years 3 3 3 3 Expected dividend yield 4.49% 4.83% 4.10% 4.25% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 30% 30% 30% 30% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% 100% Fair value per option 2.74 1.97 2.69 1.82 Expired during the period 39,386 Number of shares outstanding 2 April 2010 837,586 796,719 57,214 Share options exercised during the period by scheme grant date: 2010 2009 Exercise Number of Number of price shares shares 8 August 2005 0.00 122,406 11 July 2006 0.00 311,716 12 July 2007 0.00 295,700 607,416 122,406 As the PSP awards have a nil exercise price the risk free rate of return does not have any effect on the estimated fair value and therefore is excluded from the above table.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares.
This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive remuneration.
Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2009 under the Performance Share Plan earned interim dividends of 6p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 3.86 per share.
