Prior to this, HJ Asia was a 50%-owned joint venture, with no associated goodwill.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU has been determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are: the expected future net benefits of using HJ Asia to source products at a saving compared to sourcing from elsewhere: discount rates, and growth rates.
The estimates of future sourcing benefits are revised annually and are based on a detailed analysis of planned sourcing via HJ Asia over the next 12 months, and managements assessments of the net savings to be made from sourcing via HJ Asia, after taking into account the associated overhead costs of running the HJ Asia business.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
Because any Group borrowings are negotiated on the basis of the Group as a whole, management has chosen a discount rate which reflects their assessment of the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital 2010: 8.1%: 2009: 8.2%.
This is arrived at using the actual cost of the Groups current borrowings as a benchmark, which is then adjusted as necessary for any expected future changes.
The growth rates assume no growth other than inflation 2010: 3.5%: 2009: 3.6%, which does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the market in which HJ Asia operates.
The growth rate is felt to be appropriate in the current economic climate although management will continue to update this assumption in future periods in line with actual experience.
The value in use calculations use this growth rate to perpetuity.
The whole of the goodwill is allocated to the HJ Asia CGU.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the HJ Asia CGU.
Even with reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions, there is no indication that the carrying amount of the goodwill would be in excess of its recoverable amount.

The change in investments during the prior period relates to the redemption of part of the unlisted investment at cost during that period.
The part of the investment which was redeemed had a cost and carrying value of 2m.
The 2m cash received on redemption is shown in the cash flow statement for that period.
18 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group, and the movements on them during the current and prior reporting periods: Retirement benefit Accelerated capital Other timing obligations allowances differences Total m m m m At 27 December 2008 34.2 5.1 7.8 47.1 Charge credit to income 3.5 2.9 0.9 5.5 Credit to equity 24.4 2.1 26.5 At 26 December 2009 55.1 2.2 10.8 68.1 Charge to income 7.2 2.4 2.4 12.0 Charge to equity 11.3 11.3 At 25 December 2010 36.6 0.2 8.4 44.8 Deferred tax arising from accelerated capital allowances and short term timing differences can be further analysed as a 13.5m asset and a 5.3m liability 2009: 18.5m asset and 5.5m liability.
The presentation in the balance sheet is as follows: 25 December 2010 26 December 2009 m m Deferred tax assets 50.1 73.6 Deferred tax liabilities 5.3 5.5 44.8 68.1 There are potential deferred tax assets in relation to trading tax losses totalling 14.3m 2009: 14.8m that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
All of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group also has carried forward capital losses and the related potential deferred tax asset of 23.0m 2009: 23.9m has not been recognised.
These capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Their carrying value approximates to their fair value.
An analysis of the Groups allowance for doubtful receivables is as follows: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 25 December 2010 26 December 2009 m m Balance at start of period 10.9 10.2 Decrease increase in allowance recognised in the Income Statement 1.7 0.7 Balance at end of period 9.2 10.9 The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 30.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are in litigation.
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then sets credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
These credit limits are reviewed regularly.
In the case of one-off customers, the Groups policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer credit terms.
The historical level of customer default is low, and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high.
The Group reviews trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, whether the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and therefore whether the amounts are recoverable or require provision.
Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, legal action is taken to recover the receivable.
An allowance for impairment is made for any specific amounts which are considered irrecoverable or only partly recoverable.
There is also a separate allowance, which is calculated as a percentage of sales.
At the period end, the total bad debt provision of 9.2m 2009: 10.9m consists of a specific provision of 4.2m 2009: 6.0m which has been made against specific debts with a gross carrying value of 4.8m 2009: 6.5m, and a provision of 5.0m 2009: 4.9m based on sales and on the historic default rate.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
76 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2010 7.4m debts were written off in the period 2009: 8.3m.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 15.1m before bad debt provision 2009: 17.9m before provision which are past due as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: 25 December 2010 26 December 2009 m m 0-30 days past due 8.0 9.1 31-60 days past due 1.4 1.3 61-90 days past due 0.7 0.9 91 days past due 5.0 6.6 Total overdue amounts excluding allowance for doubtful receivables 15.1 17.9 There were no trade receivables which would have been impaired at either period end were it not for the fact that their credit terms were renegotiated.
The Group does not renegotiate credit terms.
Other assets Other assets are disclosed separately in the balance sheet and are funds held in escrow to meet future insurance claims from furniture insurance policies written on behalf of the Groups customers.
The balance at the period end was 0.2m 2009: 0.7m and the monies are held with financial institutions which have an AArating or higher, and have maturities of up to one year.
Interest is paid at both fixed and floating rates based on LIBOR.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash at bank is either in current accounts, or is placed on short term deposit with maturity periods of less than three months.
Interest on short term deposits is paid at prevailing money market rates.
As explained in the accounting policy note, and as noted at the foot of the consolidated cash flow statement, this definition differs slightly from the definition of cash and cash equivalents, which is used in the cash flow statement, and which includes overdrafts repayable on demand.
Assets pledged as security The Group has pledged its other financial assets to secure bank borrowings.

Their carrying value in both periods approximates to their fair value.
The average credit taken for trade purchases during the period, based on total operations, was 44 days 2009: 40 days.
The Groups policy on payment of creditors is to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier, and to abide by those terms on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices.

The terms of this facility are explained further in the final paragraph of note 30 a.
This facility is secured on the property, other assets, and investments of the Group.
The carrying values of each of these classes of assets is as presented in the Balance Sheet and notes to these consolidated financial statements.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the asset backing at the time and can never exceed 160m.
As at 25 December 2010, the Group had available 149.9m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met 2009: 110.5m.
In March 2010 the facility was extended until May 2014, as is further detailed in note 30 a.
The loan carries interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin which is fixed for the first year at 250 basis points.
From March 2011 to maturity, the margin will vary between 200 and 250 basis points and will be determined by the Groups rolling Adjusted Profit Before Tax.

The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group, and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
This scheme began operation during 2006.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this scheme in the current period of 1.1m 2009: 1.0m represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
Defined benefit plan The Group operates a funded pension scheme which provides benefits based on the pensionable pay of participating employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent fund managers.
Contributions are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2009 by the scheme actuary.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward this valuation to 25 December 2010 and restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.
Actuarial gain recorded in the period in respect of the change from RPI to CPI The UK Government announced on 8 July 2010 that it will in future use the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Prices Index RPI as the measure of price inflation for the purposes of regulating occupational pension schemes.
The Groups current UK defined benefit pension scheme consists of a number of tranches, each of which is covered by slightly different rules.
The rules for some of the tranches specify that pensions will increase in line with the annual statutory order published by the UK Government.
The Group has therefore amended its assumption for increases to these tranches of the scheme to reflect that future increases on those tranches will be calculated using CPI rather than RPI.
The resulting reduction in the present value of scheme liabilities of 64.4m is treated as a change in actuarial assumptions, and this is included in the total net actuarial gains for the period of 40.5m, which can be seen in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The effect of changing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than shown above would be to increase the assessed value of liabilities by around 2% or 15m, and to increase the assessed value of the current service cost by around 2% or 0.2m.

A single long-term assumption is then calculated as the weighted average of the actual asset allocation and the long-term assumption for each asset class.
During the period there have been disinvestments in equities.
The proceeds are being held in cash at the current period end, and are to be invested in index-linked gilts when market conditions reach a specified level.
It is anticipated that this level will be reached in the near future, and therefore the expected future yield on cash balances at the year end is set with reference to the expected yield from the index-linked gilts, rather than the expected yield from cash on deposit.

For any such leases, the Group provides for any shortfall between rent payable and rent receivable on any non-trading leased properties.
The provision is based on the period until the end of the lease, or until the Group can cover the shortfall by subletting, assigning or surrendering the lease.
The property provision also includes amounts for any related shortfalls in business rates on these properties, and for dilapidations, agents fees and other professional fees.
During the current period, the property provision has been increased by 0.2m arising from an unwinding of the discount rate over time.
None of this amount relates to a change in the discount rate.
This amount is shown as a finance charge in note 10.
There is a discussion of the main sources of estimation and uncertainty which apply to this provision at note 3.
The amount of the expected future cash flows has been adjusted to reflect the expected range of possibilities and, as the outflows under this provision are expected to take place over a number of years, the provision has been discounted to its present value.
Other provisions relate to amounts due in respect of warranties and contractual terminations.

87 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Share-based payments 1 Details of each scheme The Group recognised a charge of 1.4m 2009: credit of 0.4m in respect of share-based payments during the period.
The Group has various share-based payment schemes which are all equity-settled.
The main details of all schemes which existed during the period are given below.
a Performance Share Plan This is a discretionary free share plan where participants have a contingent right to receive free shares with performance conditions attached.
The performance period is measured from the start of the financial period in which the awards are granted.
The performance period is three years.
Vesting occurs at the end of the performance period.
The different subdivisions and performance conditions are as follows: i no other condition other than continued employment.
ii 50% of the Options shall be exercisable if the compound annual growth in the Groups Operating Profit over the performance period is at least 10% rising to 100% if compound annual growth over the same period is at least 20%.
iii 25% of the award will vest if 2010 PBT of 110m is achieved.
100% will vest if 2010 PBT of 135m is achieved.
The awards will vest on a sliding scale between these two points.
b i Deferred Bonus Plan pre-2008 grants Participants defer their cash bonus into shares for a period of three years.
Participants have no entitlement to dividends during the deferral period.
There are no performance conditions attached.
The shares vest at the end of the three year holding period.
b ii Deferred Bonus Plan 2008 grant Under the Co-Investment Plan participants can defer some or all of their cash bonus into shares and pledge these deferred shares as invested shares under the Plan see below d. The deferred share awards in 2008 are the result of participants deferring the cash bonuses awarded to them in March 2008.
The shares are held in trust and participants are entitled to dividends during the deferral period.
A participant can remove the shares from the Trust at any time but as they would no longer be pledged as Invested Shares under the Co-Investment Plan, then unless replaced, the participant would forego the resulting match.
b iii Deferred Bonus Plan 2010 restricted share award During the year the Deferred Bonus Plan 2008 grant was lapsed and, in accordance with the rules of the CoInvestment Plan, an equivalent award of restricted shares was made.
c Co-Investment Plan This is a co-investment plan where each participant is permitted to invest a limited amount of shares on an annual basis for the purposes of the Plan.
At the end of a three year performance period, each invested share will be matched by an award of up to three matching shares if 2010 PBT of 135m is achieved: 25% of the maximum match i. e. 0.75:1 will be earned for achieving 2010 PBT of 110m and the awards will vest on a sliding scale between these two points.
A further match of up to two shares will be made for achieving upper quartile Total Shareholder Return TSR, measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
As at 31 December 2009, each invested share will be matched by an award of up to two matching shares if a PBT target pro-rata in relation to that set in 2010 is achieved.
88 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2010 d Foundation Plan This Plan awards nil-cost options, and also options with an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant.
i 2006 Awards Vesting of awards granted in the form of options with an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant depended on the achievement of a share price hurdle over thirty consecutive dealing days.
The exercise price of the options granted in 2006 was 92 pence.
35% of this award vests if the share price achieves 115 pence over 30 consecutive dealing days, and 100% of the award vests if the share price achieves 160 pence over 30 consecutive dealing days.
The award vests on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Vested awards can be exercised for a period of 12 months from 31 December 2008. ii 2007 Awards These awards were granted in the form of nil cost options and vested on the last day of the 2006 7 financial year to the degree that the performance conditions had been met.
There is a further deferral period of two years before the vested awards are made available to the participants.
Vesting was dependent upon the achievement of a share price hurdle over 30 consecutive dealing days and an underlying profit target of 65m for the year being met.
20% of the award vests if the share price achieves 150 pence over 30 consecutive dealing days and 100% of the award vests if the share price achieves 185 pence over 30 consecutive dealing days.
e Executive Share Options This is a discretionary share option plan.
These options are granted with an exercise price equal to market value.
The vesting period is three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of seven years i. e. a total life of ten years.
In the information below, these options have been further subdivided according to their different performance conditions, in order to give more meaningful information.
The different subdivisions and performance conditions are as follows: i 40% vesting if EPS growth equals RPI 40%, rising to 100% vesting for EPS growth of RPI 100%.
ii 50% vesting if there is EPS growth of 60% over the performance period, and 100% vesting if there is EPS growth of 120% over the performance period.
iii EPS growth must equal RPI 9%.
If this is achieved there will be full vesting.
If this is not achieved there will be no vesting.
iv 20% of the options will vest if the share price over 30 consecutive dealing days is 185 pence rising on a straightline basis to 100% vesting if the share price over 30 consecutive days reaches 265 pence.
Underpinning this is a requirement to achieve 20% annual compound growth over the performance period.
v Full vesting will occur if the Groups cumulative profit before tax is at least 90m over the three financial years ending December 2009, 2010, and 2011.
f Long Term Incentive Plan This is a discretionary plan under which the Group may grant different types of share award including market value and nil cost options, conditional awards of shares and restricted shares where the employee is the owner of the shares from the date of award but subject to forfeiture.
Unless otherwise specified all awards have substantially the same terms.
i Market value options, the vesting period for which is three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of seven years i. e. a total life of ten years, will vest if cumulative PBT of 90m is achieved over the three financial years ending 2009, 2010 and 2011. ii Market value options will vest after a three year period from the date of grant.
15% of the options will vest if the Group achieves growth in pre-exceptional PBT equivalent to RPI over the performance period: 100% will vest if preexceptional PBT growth is equivalent to RPI 8% is achieved.
iii Conditional Share Award - shares will vest at the end of a three year period commencing on the date of grant subject to continuing employment.
89 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued g Share Incentive Scheme FreeShares This is an all-employee share incentive plan whereby participants receive a grant of free shares in the Group.
If the employees are still employed by the Group three years after the grant, then the shares vest.
Dividends are paid out on the shares between award date and vesting date.
There are no other performance conditions attached to these awards.
2 Movements in the period The following tables show the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of each category of share options during the period, and the movements in each category.
The significance of options granted before 7 November 2002 is that they have been excluded from the IFRS 2 share-based payment charge on the basis of their date of grant, as allowed on adoption of IFRS.

At the time of the grants made under this plan it was established that the fair value of the 2008 plan on the day it ceased was equal to the fair value of this plan on the day it commenced.
As the 2010 grant resulted in no incremental fair value, it has had no effect on the amount charged to the Income Statement in the period.

of grant using a binomial option valuation model.
Sharesave schemes are valued using a Black Scholes model as they are not considered to be of such complexity that they require a binomial model.
The key assumptions used in the models were: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 26 December 2010 25 December 2009 Dividend yield % Expected share price volatility % 53 50 to 52 Historical volatility % 53 50 to 52 Risk-free interest rate % 3.4 2.79 to 3.18 Expected life of options years 6.5 6.4 to 6.5 Historical volatility is measured for each scheme over the period equal to the vesting period of the scheme.
The figure arrived at is then used as the best estimate of expected future volatility.
100 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2010 29 Related party transactions Transactions between Group companies, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
The Group had no other related party entities during the current or prior periods.
Remuneration of key management personnel Key management personnel comprise the Board of Directors including non-executive directors and the Executive Committee.
Details of the aggregate remuneration to these personnel is set out below: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 25 December 2010 26 December 2009 m m Short-term employment benefits 6.1 5.1 Termination benefits 0.3 6.1 5.4 Other transactions with key management personnel There were no other transactions with key management personnel.
30 Financial risk management a Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to maximise the return to shareholders through the optimisation of its debt and equity balance, trading-off the benefits of financial leverage with the expected future costs of financial distress.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt including the borrowings disclosed in note 22 offset by cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent including issued share capital and reserves as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and in note 25.
The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure regularly, including, but not limited to, the time of preparing annual budgets, preparing three year corporate plans, and considering corporate transactions.
As part of this review, the Board reviews the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs, as well as the issue of new debt or the repayment of existing debt.
At the period end, the Group had a 160m committed bank facility secured against the assets of the Group and based on four sub-facilities stock, trade receivables, property and a cash flow facility.
The facility limit was the lower of 160m and the sum of the four sub-facilities.
The property component initially 17.4m amortises at the rate of 141,667 each month, whereas the other components act as a revolving credit facility with no amortisation.
Under the terms of the facility, none of the Groups principal subsidiary companies can sign up to additional secured borrowings, other than those expressly permitted within the terms of the facility.
The facility i permits normal trade credit granted to it in the ordinary course of business: ii allows up to 20m of additional secured borrowings and iii allows up to 10m of finance lease borrowing.
During the year the maturity of the facility was extended from May 2011 to May 2014.
As part of the extension the facility was reduced from 175m to 160m alongside a revised interest rate structure.
Further information is shown in the Financial Review.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
101 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued b Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
c Categories of financial instruments 25 December 2010 26 December 2009 m m Financial assets current and non-current Trade receivables 68.9 65.4 Cash and cash equivalents 38.6 14.0 Other assets 0.2 0.7 Financial liabilities current and non-current Trade payables 64.1 50.2 Borrowings 3.8 12.3 d Financial risk management General The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
The Board has approved and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits, controlling and reporting structures.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed, and the quantification of the level of exposure in the balance sheet is shown below subcategorised into credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Board and are overseen by the Executive Committee.
In turn, the Executive Committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group Treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group Treasury regularly reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying and evaluating financial risks.
The Group does not take positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual bank deposit or lending arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents, which is the term used in the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand, as defined immediately above, together with any overdrafts repayable on demand.
Arrangements are in place to ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
The prime consideration in the investment of cash balances is the security of the asset, followed by liquidity and then yield.
Management of trade receivables is discussed in note 20.
102 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2010 e Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, other assets, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups policy on dealing with trade customers is described in the accounting policies and in note 20.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on liquid funds through adherence to a policy of minimum long-term counterparty credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies Standard & Poors AAand Moodys Aa3.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 25 December 2010 26 December 2009 m m Trade receivables net of allowance 68.9 65.4 Cash and cash equivalents 38.6 14.0 Other assets 0.2 0.7 Total credit risk exposure 107.7 80.1 f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities as far as is possible.
Included in note 22 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
In addition, the Financial Review contains a section describing the interaction of liquidity risk and the going concern review.
103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Maturity profile of outstanding financial liabilities The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The Group has no derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

104 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2010 g Market risk This is the risk that financial instrument fair values will fluctuate owing to changes in market prices.
The significant market risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
These are discussed further below: Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to several currencies, principally as a result of operating costs incurred in foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent from non-Sterling revenues.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to currency risk is as follows: 25 December 2010 26 December 2009 m m Euro Trade receivables 1.9 1.4 Cash and cash equivalents 2.2 2.4 Trade payables 11.8 12.1 7.7 8.3 US Dollar Trade receivables 0.3 Cash and cash equivalents 3.5 1.9 Trade payables 2.9 6.8 0.9 4.9 Hong Kong Dollar Trade receivables Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 Trade payables 0.1 Chinese Yuan Trade receivables Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 Trade payables 0.1 Total 6.7 13.1 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the parent company has borrowed funds at floating interest rates.
The Board has reviewed this risk of interest rate increases causing financial distress and concluded that hedging protection should only be considered if net borrowings or cash surpluses were to exceed 150m.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Payments on the Groups finance leases are fixed on inception of the lease contract, and as such are regarded as fixed rate borrowings.
105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued h Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments as at its year end to changes in market variables, being exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at the balance sheet date.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and therefore carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
No sensitivity is provided for accrued interest as accruals are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate movements.
Finance lease interest payments are fixed at the inception of the contract and are not subject to repricing.
They have therefore been excluded from this analysis.
Translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency have been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following analyses show the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency or interest rates: Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group holds no derivative financial instruments.
Fixed rate liabilities are not susceptible to changes in interest rates, and are omitted from the analysis below.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis points increase is used as this represents managements assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups net profit and profit and loss reserve would decrease by 0.1m 2009: 0.1m.
Foreign exchange sensitivity As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euro, US dollar, and Chinese Yuan exchange rates the Hong Kong dollar being effectively pegged to the US dollar.
The following information details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% weakening or strengthening in pounds Sterling against the Euro, the US Dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, and the Chinese Yuan.
These percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent managements assessment of the possible change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
25 December 2010 26 December 2009 m m 10% weakening of Sterling to Euro 0.8 0.9 10% strengthening of Sterling to Euro 0.7 0.8 10% weakening of Sterling to US dollar 0.1 0.6 10% strengthening of Sterling to US dollar 0.1 0.5 The Groups sensitivity, on the basis above, to a strengthening or weakening of Sterling to either the Hong Kong Dollar or the Chinese Yuan was less than 0.1m at both the current and prior period ends.
