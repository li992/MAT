A provision of US$9.7 million 2009: nil relates to Tongon as production commenced in November 2010.
The remaining US$5.9 million relates to Morila 31 December 2009: US$5.7 million.
The provisions for rehabilitation costs include estimates for the effect of inflation and changes in estimates and have been discounted to their present value at 3.5% 2009: 3.5% per annum, being an estimate derived from the risk free rate.
Limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in Mali and in Cte dIvoire to govern the mines, so the directors have based the provisions for environmental rehabilitation on standards set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up-to-date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
However, it is reasonably possible that the groups estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The group is committed to rehabilitation of its properties.
It makes use of independent environmental consultants for advice and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
Current Life of Mine plans envisage the expected outflow to occur at the end of the Life of Mine, which is 2013 for Morila, 2029 for Loulo and 2020 for Tongon.
