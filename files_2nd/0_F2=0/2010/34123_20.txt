Annual head office bonuses Executive Directors participate in the Companys annual head office bonus arrangements.
There is no separate bonus plan for Executive Directors.
Bonuses are discretionary and are performance related.
They are assessed annually, determined by the Remuneration Committee and based on corporate performance during the year.
The bonus arrangements are structured so as not to encourage inappropriate risk taking.
The bonuses are directly linked to the Groups profit and operating cash flow performance.
There is no deferrable element of the bonus, and it is non pensionable.
The maximum bonus potential is 25% of annual basic salary.
The Committee approved the payment of the head office bonus of 10% of basic salary for the head office staff, including the Executive Directors, for the year ended 31 March 2010.
For the year ended 31 March 2009, the Executive Directors waived their bonus payments.
Executive Directors bonuses were 10% of salary for the year ended 31 March 2008 and 15% for the year ended 31 March 2007.
Pension arrangements Pension contributions of 10% of basic salary are paid into a personal pension plan for each Director.
Share incentives Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP Approval was granted by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting for a Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that an incentive plan using an award of nil-priced options is the most appropriate way to provide a competitive and market-related long term equity opportunity.
The principal reasons for the Remuneration Committee favouring the use of nil-priced options are: the greater alignment of Executive reward with shareholder interests: and the reduced volatility of nil-priced options to general share price movements.
Participation in the LTIP is only available to Executive Directors and selected senior management.
The first awards under the LTIP to Directors were made in June 2005.
Initial awards were designed to incentivise the Executive team for the period between 2005 and 2010, although awards are made under the LTIP on an annual basis.
Individual grants of options to Executive Directors since the inception of the LTIP scheme have been determined by the Committee.
All awards to date have been approved by shareholders, through approval of the Companys Remuneration Report.
In respect of the current year and in all future grants to Executive Directors, it is intended that the maximum annual grant of awards will not exceed 100% of a participants annual base salary, except where the Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances which justify an award above this limit.
The Committee awarded options under the LTIP at a level of between 75% and 100% of salary in 2009.
For 2010, it is proposed that the awards are set at 100% of salary for all Executive Directors.
This remains at the lower end of the market, particularly in light of salary levels for the Executive Directors.
The most recent awards are shown in the table below.
of shares Director 3 August 2009 James Gibson 76,200 Nicholas Vetch 69,500 Adrian Lee 42,300 John Trotman 27,800 The number of ordinary shares issuable pursuant to awards granted under this LTIP and all other employee share schemes adopted by the Company may not be more than 10% of the ordinary share capital in any ten year period.
Any award under the LTIP that does not vest at the end of the specified performance period will lapse.
