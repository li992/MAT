notes to the Financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 1. accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of sports direct international plc the company and its subsidiaries together the Group have been prepared in accordance with international Financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union iFrs.
the Group has adopted ias1 revised 2007 and iFrs 8 during the year.
the adoption of ias 1 revised 2007 does not affect the financial position or profits of the Group but does give rise to additional disclosures.
the measurement and recognition of the Groups income and expenditure is unchanged.
a third balance sheet has not been presented on the adoption of ias 1 revised 2007 because the information is unchanged from previously published financial statements.
iFrs 8 has been adopted and segments are identified based on the internal management reports used by the Board.
no other iFrss, international reporting interpretations committee iFric interpretations and amendments have been adopted in the financial statements.
Basis oF preparation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with iFrs as adopted for use in the european union including international accounting standards ias and international Financial reporting interpretations committee iFric interpretations and with those parts of the companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under iFrs as adopted for use in the european union.
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include fair valuation of financial assets and derivative financial instruments.
consolidation the consolidated financial statements consolidate the revenues, costs, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the company and its subsidiaries, being those entities in relation to which the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally achieved by a share of more than 50% of the voting rights.
on acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the consolidated income statement in the period of acquisition.
the interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
associates and Joint Ventures associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
a joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other ventures under a contractual agreement.
the Groups share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included in the Groups consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting.
investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the Groups consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in value.
the carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures include acquired goodwill.
if the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
inVestMents available-for-sale investments are initially recognised at fair value.
Where fair value is different to cost, this is recognised in the income statement on initial recognition.
subsequent gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity through the statement of comprehensive income, until the security is disposed or fide-recognised at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the consolidated income statement for the period.
section 4 FINANCIAl STATEMENTS if an available-for-sale investment is determined to be impaired, the cumulative loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
contracts for difference are a type of financial instrument and therefore gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of these investments are recognised directly in the income statement.
GoodWill Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or when a change in circumstances or situation indicates that the goodwill has suffered an impairment loss.
any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the amount of goodwill relating to that business.
When the minority interests of an existing subsidiary are acquired the carrying value of the minority interests in the balance sheet is eliminated.
the excess of consideration over the carrying value of the minority interests is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
otHer intanGiBle assets Brands, trade marks and licences that are internally generated are not recorded on the balance sheet.
acquired brands, trade marks and licences are initially carried on the balance sheet at cost.
the fair value of brands, trade marks and licences that are acquired by virtue of a business combination is determined at the date of acquisition and is subsequently assessed as being the deemed cost to the Group.
no amortisation is charged on brands, trade marks or perpetual renewable licences with an indefinite life as the Group believes that the value of these brands and trade marks can be maintained indefinitely.
the Group carries out an impairment review of indefinite life intangibles, at least annually, or when a change in circumstances or situation indicates that those intangibles have suffered an impairment loss.
impairment is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible asset as part of the cash generating unit cGu with the recoverable amount of the cGu, that is, the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows, using a discount rate based on an estimate of the rate that the market would expect on an investment of comparable risk.
amortisation is provided on brands, trade marks and licences with a definite life over their useful economic lives of 10 to 15 years and is accounted for within the selling, distribution and administrative expenses category within the income statement.
propertY, plant and equipMent property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation less any recognised impairment losses.
cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items.
subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably.
all other costs, including repairs and maintenance costs, are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land and is calculated on a reducing balance basis or straight-line basis, whichever is deemed by the directors to be more appropriate, to allocate cost less assessed residual value, other than assets in the course of construction, over the estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold buildings 2% per annum leasehold property over the term of the lease plant and equipment between 5% and 33% per annum the assets useful lives and residual values are reviewed and, if appropriate, adjusted at each balance sheet date.
the gain or loss arising on disposal or scrapping of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, net of selling costs, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
sports direct international plc annual report 2010 p. 71 notes to the Financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 continued 1. accounting policies continued iMpairMent oF assets otHer tHan GoodWill and intanGiBle assets WitH an indeFinite liFe at each balance sheet date, the directors review the carrying amounts of the Groups tangible and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
if the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
an impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill.
any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior periods.
a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
reVenue recoGnition revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.
in the case of goods sold through retail stores, revenue is recognised when goods are sold to the customer, less provision for returns.
accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of the sale.
retail sales are usually in cash, by debit card or by credit card.
in the case of income generated from trade marks and licences, revenue is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the relevant agreements or on a transactional basis when revenue is linked to sale or purchase volumes.
revenue from property related transactions is recognised when the relevant service is provided.
exceptional iteMs the Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those significant items of income and expense which, because of their size, nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
interest incoMe interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
GoVernMent Grants and siMilar incoMe income from government grants and similar income such as landlord contributions and inducements that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the balance sheet as a deduction in arriving at the carrying amount of the related asset.
this is considered to reflect the true cost of the asset to the Group.
the amount is recognised in the consolidated income statement over the life of the depreciable asset by way of a reduced depreciation charge.
to date the Group has not received government grants in compensation for expenses charged in the consolidated income statement.
section 4 FINANCIAl STATEMENTS ForeiGn currencies the presentational currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period.
exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
all differences are taken to the income statement.
on consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations which have a functional currency other than sterling are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
the revenues and expenses of these subsidiary undertakings are translated at average rates applicable in the period.
all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, combined exchange differences that have been recognised as a separate component of equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
in order to mitigate its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts see chief executives report and cash flow hedging accounting policy on page 18. inVentories inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value.
cost includes the purchase price of the manufactured products, materials, direct labour, transport costs and a proportion of applicable overheads.
cost is calculated using FiFo first in, first out.
net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less all estimated selling costs.
loans and receiVaBles loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost under the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
casH and casH equiValents cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short term highly liquid investments.
trade and otHer paYaBles trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
deFerred taxation deferred taxation is calculated using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
in addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
deferred tax liabilities are provided in full.
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
sports direct international plc annual report 2010 p. 73 notes to the Financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 continued 1. accounting policies continued changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
pensions the Group operates pension plans for the benefit of certain employees, including both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
in relation to its defined contribution plans, the Group makes contributions to independently administered plans, the contributions being recognised as an expense when they fall due.
the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make any further payments to the plans other than the contributions due.
in relation to its defined benefit schemes, the Group recognises in its balance sheet the present value of its defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets.
the current service cost is charged against operating profit.
interest on the scheme liabilities is included in finance costs and the expected return on scheme assets is included in finance income.
the defined benefit obligation is calculated at each period end by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
the present value of the obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liabilities.
actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
BorroWinGs and BorroWinG costs Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently at amortised cost.
any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs, being interest and other costs incurred in connection with the servicing of borrowings, are recognised as an expense when incurred.
proVisions a provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
the Group provides for dilapidations costs following advice from chartered surveyors and previous experience of exit costs.
the estimated cost of fulfilling the leasehold dilapidations obligations is discounted to present value and analysed between non-capital and capital components.
the capital element is recognised as a decommissioning cost and depreciated over the life of the asset.
the non-capital element is taken to the income statement in the first year of the lease where the cost it represents is of no lasting benefit to the Group or its landlord.
Wear and tear costs are expensed to the income statement.
provisions for onerous lease contracts are recognised when the Group believes the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease.
leases leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
the asset subject to the finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term.
the corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included as a liability.
leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group does not have substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
incentives provided by the lessor are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term.
section 4 FINANCIAl STATEMENTS rental income from operating leases where the Group acts as a lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
deriVatiVe Financial instruMents and HedGe accountinG the most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the us dollar.
the Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with purchases denominated in foreign currencies by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement are immediately recognised in the Group income statement.
Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
in order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
the Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
this effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
casH FloW HedGinG derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast purchases.
the effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity.
the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Group income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Group income statement.
the classification of the effective portion when recognised in the Group income statement is the same as the classification of the hedged transaction.
any element of the remeasurement of the derivative instrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Group income statement within finance income or costs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
at that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
if a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Group income statement.
treasurY sHares the purchase price of the Groups own shares that it acquires is recognised as treasury shares within equity.
the difference between the market value and the average purchase price of shares sold out of treasury is transferred to retained earnings.
eMploYee BeneFit trust the cost of shares acquired by the sports direct employee Benefit trust is recognised within own share reserve in equity.
sHare Based paYMents the Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain directors and employees.
these are measured at fair value at the date of grant which is expensed to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with the corresponding credit going to equity.
Fair value is based on the market share price on the grant date, the likelihood of meeting the vesting targets and the expected number of staff who will leave the company prior to the vesting date.
the expected staff numbers used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
a share based payment charge of 10,767,000 was recognised in selling, distribution and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010. sports direct international plc annual report 2010 p. 75 notes to the Financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 continued 1. accounting policies continued equitY instruMents an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
diVidends dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements and as a deduction from equity in the period in which the dividends are declared.
Where such dividends are proposed subject to the approval of shareholders, the dividends are regarded as declared once shareholder approval has been obtained.
international Financial reportinG standards standards in issue But not Yet eFFectiVe at the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, the international accounting standards Board iasB and international Financial reporting interpretations committee iFric have issued the following standards and interpretations which are effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after the stated effective date.
these standards and interpretations are not effective for and have not been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: iFrs 9 Financial instruments effective 1 January 2013 ias 24 revised 2009 related party disclosures effective 1 January 2011 ias 27 consolidated and separate Financial statements revised 2008 effective 1 July 2009 amendment to ias 39 Financial instruments: recognition and Measurement - eligible Hedged items effective 1 July 2009 Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions - amendment to iFrs 2 effective 1 January 2010 improvements to iFrss 2009 various effective dates, earliest of which is 1 July 2009, but mostly 2010 iFrs 3 Business combinations revised 2008 effective 1 July 2009 iFric 17 distributions of non-cash assets to owners effective 1 July 2009 iFric 18 transfers of assets from customers effective prospectively for transfers on or after 1 July 2009 iFric 19 extinguishing Financial liabilities with equity instruments effective 1 July 2010 prepayments of a Minimum Funding requirement - amendments to iFric 14 effective 1 January 2011 amendment to iFrs 1 additional exemptions for First-time adopters effective 1 January 2010 amendment to ias 32 classification of rights issues effective 1 February 2010 improvements to iFrs issued May 2010 some changes effective 1 July 2010, others effective 1 January 2011 the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standard and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for the treatment of the acquisition of subsidiaries in future accounting periods.
section 4 FINANCIAl STATEMENTS 2. critical accounting estimates and judgements the critical accounting estimates and judgements made by the Group regarding the future or other key sources of estimation, uncertainty and judgement that may have a significant risk of giving rise to a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: iMpairMent oF GoodWill the calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill requires a comparison of the present value of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated, to the value of goodwill and associated assets in the balance sheet.
the calculation of present values requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating units and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
the key assumptions made in relation to the impairment review of goodwill are set out in note 15. iMpairMent oF otHer intanGiBle assets the calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of other intangible assets with an indefinite life, specifically brands, trade marks and licences, requires a comparison of the present value of the related cash flows to the value of the other intangible assets in the balance sheet.
the calculation of present value requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the other intangible assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
the key assumptions made in relation to the impairment review of other intangible assets are set out in note 15. useFul econoMic liFe oF intanGiBle assets For intangible assets which have a finite life, the directors revisit their estimate of useful economic life at each period end and revise accordingly.
licences and trade marks typically have a life of between 10 and 12 years.
identiFication and Valuation oF acquired intanGiBle assets on acquisition, each material separable intangible asset is identified and valued by the directors with assistance from a professional third party.
any such calculation is judgmental in nature as it is based on a valuation methodology.
Brand valuations are typically valued using the relief from royalty valuation methodology.
the nature and carrying amounts of these assets are set out in note 15. proVision For oBsolete, sloW MoVinG or deFectiVe inVentories the directors have applied their knowledge and experience of the sports retail industry in determining the level and rates of provisioning required in calculating the appropriate inventory carrying values.
the nature and carrying amounts are set out in note 18.
Financial position oF retireMent BeneFit plans the net defined benefit pension plan assets or liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet.
the determination of the financial position requires assumptions to be made regarding inter alia future salary increases, mortality, discount rates and inflation.
the key assumptions made in relation to the pension plan are set out in note 23. proVision For dilapidations and onerous lease contracts the basis of the estimation of the provisioning for dilapidations and onerous lease contracts is detailed in the provision accounting policy and note 25. estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, external advice and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
proVision For costs relatinG to reGulatorY enquiries provision has been made for legal costs incurred in the period relating to ongoing regulatory enquiries.
leGal dispute surroundinG aVailaBle-For-sale Financial assets no provision has been made against the recoverable of 14.7m which is detailed in note 17. sports direct international plc annual report 2010 p. 77 notes to the Financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 continued 3.
Financial risk management the Groups current activities result in the following financial risks and set out below are managements responses to those risks in order to minimise any resulting adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
ForeiGn excHanGe risK the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via: a transactional exposure from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
transactional exposures that could significantly impact the income statement are hedged.
these exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
the notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in note 27. b net investment exposure, from the fair value of net investments outside the uK.
We hedge our investments in our international via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies.
these are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
interest rate risK the Group has net borrowings, which are principally at floating interest rates linked to bank base rates or liBor.
the Group does not use interest rate financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements.
the Group regularly monitors and reacts accordingly to any exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the impact on its monetary assets and liabilities.
credit risK the directors have a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
the Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
at each balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.
liquiditY risK the availability of adequate cash resources is managed by the Group through utilisation of its revolving bank and other facilities together with equity and retained profits thereby achieving continuity of funding and short-term flexibility.
capital ManaGeMent a description of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are included in the financial review on page 18 of this report.

the Group does not cease to own, or for a period of at least three months does not cease to use the relevant premises for which the grant was provided or its related assets.
the Group employs at least 507 permanent full-time employees or equivalent at the relevant premises.
the Group employs in total at least 1,171 employees at the relevant premises.
if the Group fails to adhere to any of the above conditions during the conditional period the east Midlands development agency may demand full repayment of the grant.
in the prior year the impairment charge was recognised in exceptional items in the consolidated income statement.
the carrying value of goodwill and brands that are considered to have an indefinite life are allocated to cash-generating units as follows: Goodwill Brands 000 000 retail 14,330 855 Brands 101,961 77,381 116,291 78,236 section 4 FINANCIAl STATEMENTS the Group tests the carrying amount of goodwill and assets with an indefinite life annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that their carrying value might be impaired.
the carrying amounts of other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication of impairment.
impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amounts to the value in use derived from discounted cash flow projections for the cash generating units cGu to which the intangible assets are allocated.
Value in use calculations are based on 5 year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long term growth rate of the sector served by the cGus.
the key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each cGu, in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives as at 25 april 2010 were as follows: retail and Brands annual sales growth for the first five years of between 0% and 7% depending on the constituent elements of the cGu, followed by terminal sales growth of 2-4%.
Gross margin of between 30% and 47% depending on the constituent elements of the cGu.
annual maintenance expenditure of between nil and 1.0m per annum depending on the individual entitys circumstances.
discount rates are estimated at a risk adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of between 12.6% and 17.3%.
the key assumptions are based on managements historical experience and future plans for each cGu.
a reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any cGu to exceed its recoverable amount.
the intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the grounds of the proven longevity of the brands and trading names and the Groups commitment to maintaining those brands.
in 2009 an impairment charge 14,832,000 was recognised, mainly due to an increase in discount rates to reflect specific risk factors and a decrease in forecast sales growth as a result of the tough economic climate.
no impairment charge was recognised in 2010.

on 8 october 2008, KsF went into administration and we ware in dispute with the administrators concerning the ownership of the shares they held.
in the 2009 the financial statements we concluded that we may not directly control the shares for accounting purposes and therefore treated them as having been derecognised.
this derecognition resulted in the trasfer of historic losses, previously recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense, of 53,156,000 into the income statement in the year ended 26 april 2009. sports direct international plc annual report 2010 p. 91 notes to the Financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 continued 17. available-for-sale financial assets continued on 21 February 2010 the company entered into an agreement with administrator of KsF to acquire any rights which may be determined that they hold.
on 13 May 2010 the judgement of the court proceedings which commenced on 26 april 2010 was handed down.
the court determined that the Group had acquired beneficial interest in 12,153,071 ordinary shares in Blacks leisure and 5,775,255 in Jd sports on 8 october 2008. this acquisition is reflected in these financial statements.
the judgement also resulted in the Group regaining control of the shares.
the administrator of KsF has now appealed the decision.
sdis ownership of the shares is no longer in dispute, but were KsF to be successful in an appeal then sdi would be required to pay an amount of c14.7m, which is currently held in escrow and included in other debtors.

Fair value hierarchy the Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
unlisted equity investments are included in level 3. the fair value of the embedded derivative is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on financial forecasts.
as at 25 april 2010, the only financial instruments measured at fair value were derivative financial assets and available-for-sale financial assets and these are classified as level 1.
B deriVatiVes: ForeiGn currencY ForWard purcHase contracts the most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the us dollar.
the Groups policy is to reduce substantionally the risk associated with purchases denominated in foreign currencies by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.
at 25 april 2010 no purchase contracts and no sale contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2009: nil million of purchase contracts.
