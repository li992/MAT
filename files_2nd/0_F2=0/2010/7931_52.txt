Base Salary The Remuneration Committee reviews base salary annually following detailed consideration of a number of factors including individual responsibilities, performance, market value of the relevant executive and external market data.
In line with our Remuneration Policy base salary is set within a range around the market median of the comparator group.
Base salary is theonly element of the package used to determine pensionable earnings.

The Committee is also provided with data in respect of the executives overall package so it can be benchmarked against the comparator group.
This data also enables the Committee to review the effect of any change in base pay on the executives overall package.
In setting the remuneration policy and remuneration levels for executives, the Committee considers the remuneration arrangements and employment conditions of thewider employee population within the Group.
The Groups approach for allemployees, including executives, is to set remuneration that takes account of: market practice: economic conditions: theperformance of the Group and of teams or individuals: collective agreements that may apply: and any legal or regulatory requirements in jurisdictions where it operates.
The percentage increases for executives base salaries effective both 1October 2009 and 1 October 2010 were generally lower than the average for other employees of the Group located in thesame region.
Base salaries, effective from 1 October 2010, for some Executive Directors and other senior executives were frozen: increases were generally restricted to promotions and individuals accepting additional responsibilities.
Following the Chief Executives appointment in May 2010, her 1 October 2010 base salary increase was in line with the Remuneration Committees decision to gradually align her salary with its policy outlined above.
Annual Bonus The objective of the annual bonus is to incentivise delivery of the Groups objectives and enhance performance against key financial and non-financial targets in support of our KPIs as well as other non-financial metrics such as our anti-illicit trade activities, as set out on pages 22 to 24.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2010 the potential maximum bonus was 150 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, 135 per cent for the Finance Director and the Chief Operating Officer and 120 per cent for the Group Sales and Marketing Director.
In support of the Groups KPIs, the Remuneration Committee determined that for the financial year ending 30 September 2010 up to 100 per cent of salary 85 per cent for the Group Sales and Marketing Director could be earned for achieving financial targets based on a matrix including growth in adjusted earnings per share and reduction of adjusted net debt.
During the year we delivered adjusted EPS of 178.8 pence up 11 per cent.
When combined with debt reduction of over 1 billion this resulted in 100 per cent of the financial element vesting.
The remainder of the annual bonus could be earned for performance against other stretching, quantifiable non-financial targets in important strategic areas such as volume growth and market share targets, which support our cigarette volumes and white stick equivalents KPIs, and anti-illicit trade activities, which support our focus on future foundations.
The nonfinancial targets are not disclosed as they are considered to be commercially confidential but were met in part, with 54 per cent vesting.
This resulted in bonuses, as detailed in the table on page 82, being awarded to the Executive Directors.
These payments represent 127 per cent of the Chief Executives base salaries, 119 per cent of the Finance Directors base salary and 104 per cent of the Group Sales and Marketing Directors base salary.
Cash bonuses were also earned by other senior managers for achieving relevant performance targets for the financial year.
Any bonus earned up to 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 85 per cent for the Group Sales and Marketing Director is paid in cash and is eligible for investment in the SMS.
Any bonus payable in excess of these levels is paid in ordinary shares which the Director is required to retain for a minimum of three years.
These ordinary shares are not eligible for investment in the SMS.
It is proposed that these limits will remain unchanged for the year ended 30 September 2011.
No element of the bonus is guaranteed.
Share Matching Scheme Under the SMS, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the Executive Directors and the majority of the Groups senior management are invited to invest any proportion of their gross bonus capped at 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 85 per cent for the Group Sales and Marketing Director in our shares.
The shares are held by a nominee administered by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided the shares lodged are left with the nominee forthree years and the participant remains an employee within the Group, they will be matched on a one-for-one basis.
Employees can exercise their vote in respect of shares held in the nominee by giving written instructions to the nominee.
In respect of investments made under the SMS by Executive Directors and, from last year, investments by members of the Chief Executives Committee, a performance criterion is applied such that matching only occurs if the Group has achieved real average annual adjusted EPS growth after adjusting for UK inflation Real Annual EPS Growth in excess of three per cent over the three year retention period.
Measurement of the performance criterion is based on the same protocol as that applying to the LTIP and there is no opportunity to re-test if the performance criterion is not met.
In setting the performance criterion for SMS awards, the Remuneration Committee has decided the Real Annual EPS Growth criterion reflects our strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
87 Strategy Performance Governance Financials Directors Remuneration Report continued Under the rules of the SMS, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired the performance period would end on the date of acquisition.

6 Mr G Davis was not eligible to participate in the award granted 15 February 2010 due to his expected retirement.
There have been no changes in any Executive Directors contingent rights since 30 September 2010.
During February 2010 annual bonuses earned in the financial year to 30 September 2006 and lodged under the SMS for a three year period matured.
The performance criterion was met in full providing matched shares for participants on a one for one basis.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in the financial year to 30 September 2009 and paid in December 2009, the Executive Directors elected, in February 2010, to invest the equivalent of their entire bonus in the form of our shares under the SMS.
These will be matched on a one for one basis provided they are left in the SMS for three years, the participant remains an employee within the Group and the Company has achieved in excess of three per cent Real Annual EPS Growth over the retention period.
This performance criterion and the award policy and vesting schedules were reviewed during the year by the Remuneration Committee who were satisfied they remain appropriate notwithstanding current market conditions.
However, the performance criterion was amended for future awards, as discussed on page 92.
These matched shares are shown within contingent rights arising above.
In accordance with the Companys normal practice, Mr G Davis was not eligible to participate in this award due to his expected retirement.
It is anticipated that in February 2011 the Executive Directors will again invest the equivalent of their entire eligible annual bonus in the SMS.
Long Term Incentive Plan Annual conditional awards are made under the LTIP to Executive Directors and other senior management.
These awards vest three years after grant and are subject to satisfying the appropriate performance criteria over the relevant three year performance period.
All grants are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and no employee has a right to receive an award.
Awards are equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, 150 per cent for the Finance Director and 100 per cent for the other Executive Director, with awards at a lower level for other senior management.
Current Structure The performance criterion for all awards is split into three elements.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance criteria at its meeting in September 2010 and was satisfied that they remain appropriate notwithstanding current market conditions.
The three elements are as follows: 88 First Element Fifty per cent of the award has a performance criterion based on average growth in adjusted earnings per share based on anagreed protocol, after adjusting for inflation over the period of the award.
At the Remuneration Committees request, our Auditors perform agreed upon procedures on the calculations.
Twelve and a half per cent of this element i. e. 6.25 per cent of the potential total award vests if Real Annual EPS Growth equals three per cent and 100 per cent of this element i. e. 50 per cent of the potential total award vests if Real Annual EPS Growth equals or exceeds 10 per cent.
Between these two points this element vests on a straight-line basis.
Second Element Twenty five per cent of the potential total award has a performance criterion based on TSR relative to the FTSE 100 Index as described below.
The performance criterion for this element is based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the relevant period.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Companys TSR ranks it in the top 50 per cent of the companies of the FTSE 100 Index.
At this performance threshold 30 per cent of this element i. e. 7.5 per cent of the potential total award vests.
If the return ranks the Company in the top 25 per cent of the Index this element i. e. 25 per cent of the potential total award vests in full.
Between these thresholds this element vests on a straight-line basis.
Third Element Twenty five per cent of the potential total award has a performance criterion based on TSR relative to a bespoke comparator group as described below.
The performance criterion for this element is also based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the relevant period.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Companys TSR exceeds that of the bottom six companies constituting a comparator group comprising 12 tobacco and alcohol companies as detailed below.
At this performance threshold, 30 per cent of this element i. e. 7.5 per cent of the potential total award vests.
If the return ranks the Company in the top three of the comparator group, this element i. e. 25 per cent of the potential total award vests in full.
The comparator group for the November 2010 award remains: AB InBev Altria Group Inc. British American Tobacco PLC Carlsberg A S Diageo PLC Heineken N. V. Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Japan Tobacco Inc. Philip Morris International Inc. Pernod Ricard S. A. Reynolds American Inc. SABMiller PLC To ensure our Executive Directors and senior managers are incentivised to drive our underlying performance and to ensure that corporate actions or fluctuations in exchange rates do not unduly affect comparative underlying performance the Remuneration Committee has agreed the following protocols: if a company within the bespoke comparator group is delisted during the performance period it will be replaced from the start of the performance period, in an agreed order, by a substitute company from a pre-determined list of Lorillard Inc, Fosters Group Limited and Molson Coors Brewing Company: if any company in the comparator group undertakes a rights issue during the performance period a cash neutral approach of selling a portion of rights to take up the balance of the rights commonly known as tail swallowing will be applied: and to remove the undue influence of exchange rate fluctuations, TSR calculations are measured in the currency in which each company is listed.
The TSR calculations use share prices of each comparator group company averaged over a period of three months to determine the initial and closing prices rather than those applying on a single day.
It is assumed that the cash flow of dividend payments is recognised on the date shares are declared ex dividend.
This method is considered to give a fairer andless volatile result as improved performance has to be sustained for several weeks before it effectively impacts on the TSR calculations.
The TSR calculations are performed independently by Alithos Limited.
Each element operates independently and is capable of vesting regardless of the Companys performance in respect of the other elements.
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance criteria, award policy, comparator group and vesting schedules for LTIP awards and decided that the three elements remain the most important measures that drive and measure sustainable improvement in shareholder value and support our longer-term KPIs, discussed on pages 22 to 24.
The TSR criteria reflect comparative performance against the appropriate FTSE sector and the bespoke comparator group of companies.
The EPS criterion reflects a key part of the Groups strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
Vesting of Awards On vesting, a participant is granted an option to acquire the relevant number of shares.
The option may be exercised at any time up to the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
Within this framework the vesting process in a number of jurisdictions outside the UK is amended to conform to local securities and tax legislation.
89 Strategy Performance Governance Financials Directors Remuneration Report continued The performance periods are set prior to the granting of each annual award and there is no opportunity to re-test if any of the performance criteria are not achieved.
Under the rules of the LTIP, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired the performance period would end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro rata basis subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
The Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to vary, but not increase, the extent to which any awards vest.
This ensures awards only vest, and vest at an appropriate level, if there has been an improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company, including the maintenance of long-term return on capital employed.

There have been no changes in any Executive Directors awards since 30 September 2010, other than the vesting of the October 2007 October 2010 award detailed below.
During the year, the November 2006 November 2009 award vested partially.
Based on EPS and TSR performance to the end of the financial year the first and second elements vested in full and approximately 76.7 per cent of the third element vested on 10November 2009.
The remaining shares under award lapsed.

The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2008 November 2011 and the November 2009 November 2012 awards as being too distant from maturity to be included in the value projected above.
However, in respect of the November 2008 November 2011 award, based upon interim measurement calculations prepared as at 30 September 2010, the first element would vest in full, approximately 30 per cent of the second element would vest and the third element would lapse if this performance were maintained over the relevant performance period.
In respect of the November 2009 November 2012 award, based upon interim measurement calculations prepared as at 30 September 2010, approximately 48.6 per cent of the first element would vest and the second and third elements would lapse if this performance were maintained over the relevant performance period.

We view the FTSE 100 Index as providing the most appropriate and widely recognised index for benchmarking our corporate performance, which is a constituent of that index, and reflects the benchmark index used as an LTIP performance criterion.
Share Options The Company does not operate an executive share option scheme.
Executive Directors are, however, eligible along with all employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries of the Group, where possible to participate in our savings related Sharesave Plan.
Under this Plan options are granted to participants who have contracted to save up to 250 per month over a period of three or five years at a discount of up of 20 per cent to the closing mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation.
In common with most plans of this type there are no performance conditions applicable to options granted under this Plan.

Full details of the Directors share interests are available for inspection in the Register of Directors Interests at our registered office.
Award Dates Our policy is to grant awards under all our employee share plans on predetermined dates based on an annual cycle.
Share Ownership Guidelines We have adopted a set of share ownership guidelines as we believe Executive Directors and other senior managers should be encouraged to hold a substantial portion of their personal wealth in our shares to align their interests with those of our shareholders.
Over a period of five years from appointment Executive Directors and other senior managers are required to build a holding in the Groups shares to a minimum value broadly equivalent to three times base salary for our Chief Executive and Finance Director and twice base salary in respect of the other Executive Directors.
Other senior management are expected to investat a level equivalent to between once and twice base salary, dependent upon grade.
Failure to meet the minimum shareholding requirement is taken into account when determining eligibility for LTIP awards.
All Executive Directors currently exceed their required shareholding.
Revisions to Executive Directors Remuneration Subject to consultation with our major shareholders and representative bodies, the Remuneration Committee has revised the policy for Executive Directors relating to the annual bonus opportunity and the SMS performance criterion as outlined below.
These revisions are designed to further increase the emphasis on driving and rewarding performance, to bring the incentive pay structure more closely into line with our comparator group of FTSE 50 companies and to further support the Groups strategy by driving growth in revenues and profit, with high levels of cash conversion.
The policy in respect of the LTIP and the share ownership guidelines remains unchanged.
Maximum Annual Bonus Opportunity The potential maximum annual bonus will increase from 150 per cent to 200 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and from 135 per cent to 150 per cent for the Finance Director, but will remain unchanged at 120 per cent for the Group Sales and Marketing Director.
In support of the Groups KPIs, as set out on pages 22 to 24, the Remuneration Committee also determined that, for the financial year ending 30 September 2011, up to 75 per cent of the maximum annual bonus representing up to 150 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive can be earned for achieving financial targets based on a matrix including growth in adjusted earnings per share and net revenue growth which is subject to market share underpins.
The remaining 25 per cent of the annual bonus representing up to 50 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive can be earned for performance against stretching, quantifiable non-financial targets, subject to achievement of a minimum threshold in respect of the financial targets.
The non-financial targets are designed to support our growth strategy by driving performance against our key growth drivers, including volume targets incentivising sales growth in support of our cigarette volumes and white stick equivalents KPIs, debt reduction targets incentivising performance against our cash utilisation KPI and targets relating to anti-illicit trade activities supporting our focus on future foundations.
