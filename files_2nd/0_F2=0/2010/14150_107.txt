vii Other receivables and other payables Other receivables and other payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Lease agreements in which the other party, as lessee, is regarded as the economic owner of the leased assets give rise to accounts receivable in the amount of the discounted future lease payments.
Contingent liabilities The Company and certain subsidiaries have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and performance bonds relating to the Groups contracts.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Segmental reporting The Groups organisational structure reflects the national nature of markets in which it operates, with divisions in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada.
Use of adjusted measures Shanks Group plc believes that trading profit, underlying profit before tax, underlying profit after tax, underlying free cash flow and underlying earnings per share provide useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
These measures are used by Shanks for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The terms trading profit, exceptional items and adjusted are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to GAAP measurements of profit.
The term underlying refers to the relevant measure being reported for continuing operations excluding exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquisition intangibles, excluding landfill void and computer software.
Trading profit is defined as continuing operating profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
2 SEGMENTAL rEPOrTING Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors and the executive committee.
The Group operates in The Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada.
As discussed in the Business Review by country on pages 22 to 34 the waste markets are different in each member state of the European Union.
As a result, the Group is organised and managed mainly by geographical location.
Each geographical location can be analysed according to the following types of activity: Solid Waste Non-hazardous solid waste collections, transfer, recycling and treatment Landfill and Power Landfill disposal including contaminated soils and power generation from landfill gas Hazardous Waste Industrial cleaning, hazardous waste transport, treatment including contaminated soils and disposal and contaminated land remediation Organic Treatment Anaerobic digestion and tunnel composting of source segregated organic waste streams PFI Contracts Long term United Kingdom municipal waste treatment contracts Sand Quarry Mineral extraction Belgium Landfill is viewed separately to Belgium Power.
In addition to the waste activities detailed above we have small infrastructure and groundworks operations in Ghent in Belgium and Amersfoort in the Netherlands.
Due to their small size the infrastructure and groundworks activities are reported as part of the Solid Waste activities.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1, except that pension expense for the United Kingdom is recognised and measured on the basis of cash payments to the pension plan.
The profit measure the Group uses to evaluate performance is trading profit.
Trading profit is operating profit before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles excluding landfill void and computer software and exceptional items.
The Group accounts for inter-segment trading on an arms length basis.
