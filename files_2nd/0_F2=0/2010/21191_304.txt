E18 Principal assumptions a Economic assumptions Deterministic calculations Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each reporting period.
In setting the risk-free rate we have, wherever possible, used the mid-price swap yield curve for an AA-rated bank.
The curve is extrapolated if necessary to get rates suitable to the liabilities.
For markets in which there is no reliable swap yield curve the relevant government bond yields are used.
For certain business, swap rates are adjusted for a liquidity premium in deriving the risk-free rates, and these adjustments are shown below the reference rate table.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin or equivalent.
