The fair value recognised in the results for the Deferred Bonus Plan has been estimated using a Black-Scholes model with inputs as at 31 December 2010, in advance of the options being granted, making reasonable assumptions over the proportion of options not vesting due to leaver or performance conditions not being satisfied.
