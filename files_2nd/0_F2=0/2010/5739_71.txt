COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Capital commitments The Group has capital commitments outstanding against major contracts.

The initial terms on all leases has expired as at 31 December 2010.
The lease terms allow for continued lease renewal after expiry of the initial term.
At the present time the annual payments arising on the leases are approximately $247 thousand.
In continuing to use these wells, the Group relies on Article 621 2 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, which states that such leases are renewed for an indefinite term if the tenant continues to use the property after the term of the lease has expired in the absence of objections from the lessor, although either party is entitled to terminate the lease upon three months notice.
The Group believes that the Russian authorities are unlikely to exercise this termination right as the Group has the exclusive right to extract the oil resources underlying the wells and continues to make lease payments.
Management expects to continue to pay for the leases until the end of the life of the reserves, in approximately 2027.
The Group also leases apartments for offices at Exillon WS and Exillon TP.
The initial terms on all leases has expired as at 31 December 2011.
At the present time the annual payments arising on the leases are approximately $394 thousand.

Managements interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Groups subsidiaries may be challenged by the relevant federal authorities.
Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments in different areas, including general tax deductibility and tax depreciation rules, transfer pricing regulations, application of thin capitalisation rules, etc.
As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed.
Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review.
Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
Combined with a possible increase in tax collection efforts to respond to budget pressures, the above may lead to an increase in the level and frequency of scrutiny by the tax authorities.
In particular, it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be challenged.
Russian transfer pricing legislation introduced on 1 January 1999 provides the possibility for tax authorities to make transfer pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities in respect of all controllable transactions where the transaction price differs from the market price by more than 20%.
Controllable transactions include: transactions with interdependent parties as determined under the Russian Tax Code, all cross-border transactions irrespective of whether performed between related or unrelated parties, transactions where the price applied by a taxpayer differs by more than 20% from the price applied in similar transactions by the same taxpayer within a short period of time, and barter transactions.
There is no formal guidance as to how these rules should be applied in practice.
In the past, the arbitration court has governed practice in this area.
Tax liabilities arising from intercompany transactions are determined using actual transaction prices.
It is possible with the evolution of the interpretation of the transfer pricing rules in the Russian Federation and the changes in the approach of the Russian tax authorities, that such transfer prices could potentially be challenged in the future.
Given the brief nature of the current Russian transfer pricing rules, the impact of 74
