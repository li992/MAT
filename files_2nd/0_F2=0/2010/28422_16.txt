Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 FI FIN NA AN NC CIAL IAL PRIMARY ST STA AT TE EM ME EN NT TS S STATEMENTS 151 Notes Basis of preparation Results bases With the exception of the adoption of IFRS 3 Revised on business combinations and associated amendments to other standards and the altered basis of presentation of Jacksons IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns referred to below, the basis of preparation of the statutory IFRS basis results and supplementary IFRS basis information is consistent with that applied for the 2009 results and financial statements.
The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the European Embedded Value Principles issued by the CFO Forum of European Insurance Companies in May 2004.
Life insurance products are, by their nature, long-term and the profit on this business is generated over a significant number of years.
Accounting under IFRS alone does not, in Prudentials opinion, fully reflect the value of future profit streams.
Prudential considers that embedded value reporting provides investors with a measure of the future profit streams of the Groups in-force long-term businesses and is a valuable supplement to statutory accounts.
With the exception of the presentation of the new business results of the Japan life operation which ceased writing new business in February 2010 there has been no other change to the basis of presentation of the EEV results from the 2009 results and financial statements.
Operating profit based on longer-term investment returns Consistent with previous reporting practice, the Group provides supplementary analysis of IFRS profit before tax attributable to shareholders and analyses its EEV basis results, so as to distinguish operating profit based on longer-term investment returns from other elements of total profit.
On both the IFRS and EEV bases, operating earnings per share are calculated using operating profits based on longer-term investment returns, after related tax and non-controlling interests.
These profits exclude short-term fluctuations in investment returns and the shareholders share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
The operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for 2010 also excludes the costs associated with the terminated AIA transaction and the gain arising upon the dilution of the Groups holding in PruHealth.
Consistent with prior presentation, the effect of disposal and the results of the Taiwan agency business are shown separately from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for 2009.
In 2010 the Company amended its presentation of IFRS operating profit for its US insurance operations to exclude the net equity hedge accounting effect of negative 367 million 2009: negative 159 million relating principally to its variable annuity business and reclassified it in the supplementary analysis of profit as a short-term fluctuation in investment returns.
Prior year comparatives have been amended accordingly.
This is a presentational change and it has no impact on the IFRS profit before tax or the IFRS shareholders funds.
The change also has no impact on the Groups EEV financial statements.
Under the EEV basis, where additional profit and loss effects arise, operating profit based on longer-term investment returns also excludes the mark to market value movements on core borrowings and the effect of changes in economic assumptions.
After adjusting for related tax and non-controlling interests, the amounts excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share.
