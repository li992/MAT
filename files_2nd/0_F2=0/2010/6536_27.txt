The Milk Pension Fund MPF The Milk Pension Fund is that previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board, and was also open to membership of staff working for Milk Marque Ltd the principal employer now known as Community Foods Group Limited, National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd which went into receivership in June 2009 and Milk Link Ltd. Genus only accounts for its section and its share of any orphan liabilities but discloses details regarding the full potential contingent liability below, as ultimate liabilities are joint and several.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Milk Pension Fund was at 31 March 2006.
The valuation of the fund used the projected unit method for future service, a control period of three years was used and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
An updated valuation at 31 March 2009 has not yet been finalised by the trustees of the scheme.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the funding valuation as at 31 March 2006, with each being expressed as the excess over the assumption for the annual rate of inflation, were as follows.
For the annual rate of return on the investments for discounting liabilities preretirement: 4%, and for discounting liabilities post-retirement: 2.05% For the annual increase in the present and future pensions in payment: nil, for the annual rate of increase in pensionable earnings for past service liabilities: 1%, and for the annual rate of increase in pensionable earnings for future service liabilities: 1%.
At the date of the valuation, the market value of the funds assets amounted to 313 million, of which Genus plcs notional share was 110m.
The actuarial value of the assets of the whole fund was sufficient to cover 98% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for assumed increases in earnings.
The deficit in the fund as a whole, disclosed by the 31 March 2006 valuation, was 6.8 million of which Genus plcs notional share was 1.9m and this shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers.
With effect from 31 May 2010, the majority of the Genus active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became deferred pensioners.
This event resulted in a curtailment gain of 2.5m, which has been recognised during the year as an exceptional item in the income statement.
The Groups pension cost for the scheme in 2010 is 0.7m 2009: 0.6m.
Dalgety Pension Fund A Deed of Agreement was signed on 23 January 2008 by the Company and the trustees of the fund which formed the basis of the funding arrangement agreed for the actuarial valuation of the fund as of 31 March 2006.
Under the agreement the Company agreed to make deficit repair contributions of 2.4m to the fund of which 1.8m were made by 31 December 2007 with a further 0.6m in January 2008.
The trustees of the fund also agreed to transfer an amount of 4.8m into the fund from their trustee share of surplus.
2.1m of this amount was in respect of known liabilities with an additional 2.7m transferred as a reserve against future unknown liabilities materialising.
As the economic benefit to the Company of this latter amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Dalgety Pension Fund was at 31 March 2006.
The valuation of the scheme used the projected unit method and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The disclosures required under IAS19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate calculations carried out as at 31 March 2006 updated to 30 June 2010.
For the purposes of their calculations, the Dalgety Pension Fund actuary has offset the value of the annuity policies and the element of the surplus under the control of the Trustees.
New employees are no longer able to join the scheme.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members approach retirement.
