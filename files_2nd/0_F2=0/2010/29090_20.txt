82 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 Presentation of the financial statements Financial information for the year ended 31 December 2010 is presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The presentation of the financial statements has been reformatted in 2010 to enable greater understanding of the financial results and position of the Group.
Where appropriate, the comparative information has also been reformatted for better comparison.
IAS 1 allows an entity to present some of its assets and liabilities using a current non-current classification and others in order of liquidity when this provides information that is reliable and more relevant.
The Group has adopted a mixed basis of presentation within its consolidated balance sheet which shows the assets and liabilities of the Groups Life Company business, Schroder Pension Management Limited see note 17, in order of liquidity and the remainder of the Groups assets and liabilities using a current non-current classification.
The presentation of the Life Company assets has been amended to display more detail on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.
If the assets and liabilities of the Groups Life Company business were to be included within existing captions on the Groups balance sheet, the effect would be to gross up a number of individual line items to a material extent.
By adopting a mixed basis of presentation, the Group is able to provide a more transparent presentation that shows the assets of the Life Company and the related unit-linked liabilities as separate and distinct from the remainder of the Groups balance sheet items.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise Standards and Interpretations approved by either the International Accounting Standards Board or the IFRS Interpretations Committee or their predecessors, as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial information presented within these financial statements has been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of derivative financial instruments and financial assets and liabilities that are available-for-sale or held at fair value through profit or loss and the measurement of long-term employee benefits at present value of the obligation less fair value of any assets held to settle the obligation.
Except as a result of new or amendments to accounting standards, the Groups principal accounting policies have been consistently applied.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
Any areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed within the notes below and identified with background shading, along with the principal accounting policy relevant to that note.
With the exception of IAS 24 see below, the Group did not adopt any Standards which were issued during the year, but which were not effective at the balance sheet date.
The Group adopted all Standards and Interpretations that became effective during the year.
Relevant Standards and Interpretations not yet adopted at the balance sheet date were: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 has not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
As it currently stands, the Standard replaces the classification and measurement models for financial instruments in IAS 39 with two classification categories: amortised cost and fair value.
Equity instruments will be recorded at fair value, with gains or losses reported either in the income statement or through equity.
However, for fair value assets held through equity there will no longer be a requirement to transfer gains or losses to the income statement on impairment or disposal.
Debt instruments that meet a new definition in IFRS 9 will be recorded at amortised cost unless this results in an accounting mismatch.
A combination of the Standards requirements and the Groups decision as to how it wishes to treat each instrument on adoption will determine the impact of the new Standard.
The Standards and Interpretations adopted in the year required the Group to amend its accounting policies, but had no numerical impact on the Groups financial statements.
Relevant standards and Interpretations adopted were: IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations IAS 24 Amendment early adopted Related Party Disclosures IAS 27 Revised Consolidation of Separate Financial Statements IAS 39 Amended Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IFRIC 16 New Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp082 130. indd 82 15 03 2011 12:49 83 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 Other than those listed above, at the balance sheet date, no Standards or Interpretations either issued and effective, or issued and not yet effective, had or are expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
Net gains and losses on foreign exchange The results of subsidiary undertakings, branches and associates drawn up in currencies other than sterling are translated at average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
The assets and liabilities of these entities are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the results of these entities from the average rate used in the income statement to theclosing rate used in the balance sheet are taken in other comprehensive income.
In addition, exchange differences arising on the translation of the equity of these undertakings at the beginning of the year, together with hedges of such exposures, are also taken directly in other comprehensive income and included in other reserves, within net exchange differences and the hedging reserve respectively.
Assets and liabilities held by subsidiary entities in a different foreign currency to their functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any exchange differences arising are included within Net revenue in the income statement unless they relate to non-monetary items whose gains or losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
For such non-monetary items, the exchange components of those gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial information contained within the financial statements incorporates financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries prepared to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Where the Group controls an entity, but does not own all the share capital of that entity, the interest of the other shareholders non-controlling interests is stated within equity at the non-controlling interests proportion of the carrying values of the recognised assets and liabilities.
The accounts of subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates, which are prepared using uniform accounting policies, are coterminous with those of the Company apart from those of certain undertakings which have accounting reference dates other than 31December for commercial reasons.
Management accounts made up to 31 December are used for such undertakings.
The results of subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates acquired or sold are included from or to the date control or joint control for subsidiaries or joint ventures or significant influence for associates changes.
Joint ventures and associates are included at the Groups share of the net assets of the relevant entity after the elimination of intra-Group balances and transactions.
Employee share ownership trusts have been established for the purposes of satisfying certain share-based awards.
These trusts are fully consolidated within the accounts.
The Group has investments in a number of funds where it is in a position to be able to control those funds.
These funds are typically held by the Groups Life Company see note 17 or represent seed capital investments by the Group.
The funds are consolidated unless they meet the definition of a non-current asset held for sale, in which case they are classified and accounted for accordingly.
Where the Group consolidates a fund, but does not own all the net assets of that fund, the interests of third party investors are classified either within unitlinked liabilities for Life Company investments or as financial liabilities where they relate to consolidated funds for seed capital or other investments.
Such balances represent the third party investors proportion of the net assets or liabilities of the relevant funds.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.

The resulting accounting estimates will seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are set out in the following notes: Note 9 Retirement benefit obligations Note 10 Tax expense Note 13 Goodwill Note 14 Intangible assets Note 15 Property, plant and equipment Note 18 Financial assets Note 24 Provisions 1 Segmental reporting i Operating segments The Group has three continuing business segments: Asset Management, Private Banking and Group.
Asset Management principally comprises investment management including advisory services, equity products, fixed income securities, multi-asset and alternative asset classes such as property, commodities, private equity and funds of hedge funds.
Private Banking principally comprises investment management and banking services provided to high net worth individuals and certain smaller institutions.
Group principally comprises returns on the Groups investments less Group expenses.
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that provided for internal reporting purposes to the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive.
One of the key measures used in respect of performance measurement is net revenue.
The allocation of costs to individual business segments is undertaken in order to provide management information on the cost of providing services and to provide managers with a tool to manage and control expenditure.
Costs are allocated on a basis that aligns the charge with the resources employed by the Group in a particular area of its business.

In many circumstances, there is judgement required to determine whether an item represents an exceptional item.
The Group believes that the deterioration of the worlds financial markets that occurred during 2008 and which continued to affect markets in 2009 constituted rare events that had a material impact on the value of the Groups investment capital and intangible assets arising from business combinations.
As such, losses on such assets during those years were classified as exceptional items, together with the cost of redundancies and actions related to the cost reduction programme that arose as a direct consequence of market conditions.
There are no similar or other circumstances that have resulted in exceptional items in 2010.

For defined contribution schemes, pension contributions payable in respect of the accounting period are charged as Operating expenses in the income statement.
Defined benefit obligations are recorded at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value at the balance sheet date of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
The difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, together with adjustments for unvested past service cost, is recognised as an asset or liability, as appropriate, in the balance sheet.
An asset arising, for example, as a result of past over-funding or the performance of the plan investments, is recognised to the extent that it is recoverable either in that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution holidays or through refunds or set offs of contributions.
Plan assets are valued on a bid basis.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in other comprehensive income.
For funded defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The current service cost, any past service cost, the notional interest charge on scheme liabilities less the expected return on scheme assets and any curtailment of pension obligations are charged to Operating expenses in the income statement.
The disclosures are provided mainly in respect of the principal defined benefit scheme in the UK, the Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme the Scheme.
The income statement charge for retirement benefit is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Pension costs defined contribution plans 16.5 15.0 Pension costs defined benefit plans 3.7 2.8 Other post-employment benefits 0.3 0.4 13.1 18.2 The defined benefit scheme income statement credit charge in respect of the Scheme consists of: Current service cost 8.0 7.5 Past service cost 3.5 0.2 Expected return on scheme assets 42.8 35.0 Curtailment 0.5 Interest on scheme liabilities 33.3 29.6 Total income statement credit charge in respect of the Scheme 5.0 1.8 Income statement charges in respect of other defined benefit schemes 1.3 1.0 Total defined benefit scheme income statement credit charge 3.7 2.8 The amounts that have been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are set out below: 2010 2009 m m Actual return less expected return on Scheme assets 37.1 0.1 Experience gains and losses arising on Scheme liabilities 1.4 16.6 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the Scheme liabilities 27.4 87.0 Total other comprehensive income gains losses in respect of the Scheme 8.3 70.3 Other comprehensive income losses gains in respect of other defined benefit schemes 0.3 0.7 Total other comprehensive income gains losses in respect of defined benefit schemes 8.0 69.6 The Scheme is non-contributory and administered by the Trustee.
It is a funded scheme comprising a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
During the year, it was open to new entrants and had 284 active members in the defined benefit section and 849 active members in the defined contribution section at 31December 2010 2009: 305 and 813 respectively.
The most recent triennial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2008.
It disclosed that the market value of the assets of the Scheme represented 92 per cent.
of the liability at that date, calculated on the funding basis applicable to the Scheme, for the benefits that had accrued to members at that date allowing for future increases in earnings and pensions.

On 30 November 2010, the Group announced a proposal to close the defined benefit section of the Scheme to future accrual on 30 April 2011, with affected employee members being offered membership of the defined contribution section from this date.
At 31 December 2010, the Group was consulting with active members over this proposed change.
On 8 March 2011 the Board determined that, following the employee consultation exercise, the defined benefit section of the Scheme would close to future accrual with effect from 30 April 2011.
The current active members of the defined benefit section of the Scheme will generally be eligible to join the existing defined contribution section.
With future accrual to cease, the Group expects to make contributions to the defined benefit section totalling approximately 2.8 million during 2011 to cover the accrual of ongoing benefits.
The Group paid effective contributions to the defined benefit section of the Scheme in 2010 of 37.5 per cent.
of pensionable salaries to cover the accrual of ongoing benefits.
For joiners on or after 1 June 1989, pensionable salaries for this purpose were subject to the statutory earnings cap which was in force until April 2006, after which this cap was replaced by a notional earnings cap.
The pension cost for the defined benefit section of the Scheme has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Aon Hewitt Limited, and is based on an assessment of the Scheme as at 31 December 2010.
The principal financial assumptions used for the Scheme were as follows: 2010 2009 % % Discount rate 5.2 5.5 RPI inflation rate 3.7 3.9 1 CPI inflation rate 3.2 Future salary increases 4.5 4.7 Future pension increases for benefits earned before 13 August 2007 3.6 3.6 Future pension increases for benefits earned after 13 August 2007 2.4 2.3 Expected return on Scheme assets analysed as: Equities 8.2 8.6 Bonds 4.6 4.9 Liability-driven investments 5.2 5.5 Other assets 4.9 5.2 Years Years Number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond age 60: Men 29 28 Women 32 31 Years Years Number of years future pensioners currently aged 45 are expected to live beyond age 60: Men 31 30 Women 33 32 1 CPI inflation rate was not applicable to the Group in 2009.
The Group operates a number of smaller pension schemes around the world, some of which are funded defined benefit schemes with valuations performed regularly by qualified actuaries.
Actuarial assumptions vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the funds are situated.
Following the UK Governments announcements about the method of increasing pensions in line with inflation, the Group has identified some elements of pension which are now assumed to increase in line with inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI.
In July 2010, the Schemes early retirement factors were changed for all future retirements from active service.
The effect of this has been recognised in the income statement as a past service credit of 3.5 million.
The Group has not materially changed any of the other principal financial assumptions underlying the calculation of the Schemes net financial position, although such assumptions have been amended where applicable to reflect current market conditions and expectations.
Administration expenses and the levy payable to the Pensions Protection Fund are met directly by the Group.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in respect of the Scheme through the statement of comprehensive income is a 83.3 million 2009: 91.6 million loss.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of Scheme assets net of investment expenses only are determined by reference to thefollowing: Bonds based on an outperformance of 0.4 per cent.
per annum above the yield on long-dated government bonds atthe balance sheet date.
Equities based on an outperformance of 4.0 per cent.
Liability-matching based on an outperformance of 1.0 per cent.

The combination and the spread across the different asset classes has been designed to reduce risk while still generating an expected return, over the long term, in excess of the cost of meeting the Schemes liabilities.

The assumptions used in determining the net charge credit for pension costs include the expected long-term rate of return on the plans assets and the discount rate.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.
The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined on a uniform basis, taking into consideration long-term historical returns, asset allocation and future estimates of long-term investment returns.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality long-dated corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid.
The other key assumption that impacts the carrying value of the obligation is that of expected mortality rates.
Any assumption made in this area is inherently uncertain.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on standard SAPS light mortality tables with the Continuous Mortality Investigation core projection factors and a long-term rate of mortality improvement of 1.5 per cent per annum.
Mortality tables for female pensioners are scaled back by 15 per cent to reflect experience analysis.
The Group reviews its assumptions annually in conjunction with its independent actuaries and considers this adjustment appropriate given the geographic and demographic profile of the scheme.
Other assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
The sensitivity of the Scheme pension liabilities to changes in assumptions are as follows: 2010 2009 Estimated Estimated Estimated Estimated reduction in reduction in reduction in reduction in pension pension pension pension liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities Assumption Assumption change m % m % Discount rate Increase by 0.5% per annum 61.8 9.4 57.8 9.4 Expected rate of salary increases Reduce by 0.5% per annum 2.2 0.3 2.3 0.4 Expected rate of pension increases in payment Reduce by 0.5% per annum 42.4 6.4 38.7 6.3 Life expectancy Reduce by one year 18.2 2.8 14.2 2.3 Membership details of the defined benefit section of the Scheme as at 31 December are as follows: 2010 2009 Active members 284 305 Total pensionable salary roll 22.7m per annum 23.2m per annum Average age active 47 46 Average service in plan 10.8 years 10.5 years Number of deferred members 1,454 1,466 Total deferred pensions at date of leaving Scheme 9.9m per annum 9.9m per annum Average age deferred 48 48 Number of pensioners 662 645 Average age pensioners 69 68 Total pensions in payment 14.6m per annum 14.0m per annum Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp082 130. indd 94 15 03 2011 22:05 95 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 10 Tax expense a Analysis of charge in the year 2010 2009 m m UK corporation tax on profits for the year 23.1 32.2 Double tax relief 18.8 Adjustments in respect of prior years 5.3 4.6 Foreign tax current 59.9 36.8 Foreign tax adjustments in respect of prior years 1.6 3.5 Total current tax 76.1 42.1 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 9.4 2.0 Adjustments in respect of prior years 9.2 1.7 Effect of changes in corporation tax rates 1.0 Total deferred tax 19.6 0.3 Total tax charge for the year 95.7 41.8 b Analysis of charge credit to equity 2010 2009 m m Current income tax on Equity Compensation Plan and share option awards 6.5 5.3 Current income tax on movements on available-for-sale financial assets 10.0 8.0 Deferred tax on Equity Compensation Plan and share option awards 5.3 10.2 Deferred tax on actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes 2.0 19.6 Deferred tax effect of changes in corporation tax rates 1.0 Tax charge credit reported in equity 1.2 43.1 c Factors affecting tax charge for the year The UK standard rate of corporation tax for the year was 28 per cent.

13 Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Any non-controlling interest in the acquiree is measured at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to annual test for impairment.
Estimates and judgements Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually and when there are circumstances which indicate that impairment may have occurred.
Recoverable amounts of goodwill are determined using a discounted cash flow model, details of which are provided below.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and cannot subsequently be reversed.

The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Costs relating to business combinations are taken to the income statement where they are recorded within Operating expenses.
The Group did not acquire any subsidiaries during the year.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
For all relevant acquisitions, the level of CGU the Group uses to determine impairment is segment level.
In 2009, following two acquisitions in 2008, the final accounting for these acquisitions was determined resulting in a transfer of 12.8 million from intangible assets to goodwill.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the relevant segments as follows: 2010 2009 m m Asset Management 111.3 107.0 Private Banking 9.1 8.6 120.4 115.6 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations applying a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions on which management have based their five-year cash flow projections are based on market growth rates of two per cent.
based on the Groups view of anticipated future market movements, a pre-tax discount rate of 14.5 per cent.
expected fund flows based on the aggregation of expectations of individual countries and expected changes to margins based on an analysis of the current fee structure flexed to take into account expected changes in product mix and the proportion of rebates payable to external distributors.
Based on the results of calculations, there is no indication that the goodwill is impaired 2009: same.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of goodwill to the methods and assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs is small due to the amount of goodwill on the Groups balance sheet relative to the size of the Groups estimations of future profitability within the CGUs to which that goodwill has been allocated.
Movements in the growth rate and or the discount rate of one per cent.
would not lead to the recognition of any impairment charge.
A comparison of actual results to the projected results used to assess goodwill impairment in prior years reveals that the Group would have recognised no changes 2009: nil to its goodwill asset in the year as a result of inaccuracies in its projections.
14 Intangible assets The Groups intangible assets comprise software together with acquired intangible assets such as future revenues from fund management contracts and client relationships as part of a business combination.
These are capitalised where it is probable that futureeconomic benefits that are attributable to the assets will flow to the Group and the cost of the assets can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset is recorded in respect of fund management contracts and client relationships acquired initially at fair value and then amortised over its useful life normally assumed to be between five and ten years, on a straight-line basis as an operating expense.
The fairvalue at the date of acquisition is calculated using discounted cash flow methodology and represents the valuation of the net residual income stream arising from the fund management contracts and client relationships in place at the date of acquisition.
The contracts are included in the balance sheet as an intangible asset.
Estimates and judgements At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that an asset in use may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and the updated discounted valuation of the remaining net residual income stream.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp082 130. indd 97 15 03 2011 20:50 98 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 14 Intangible assets continued The costs of purchasing and implementing software, together with associated relevant expenditure, are capitalised where it is probable that future economic benefits that are attributable to the assets will flow to the Group and the cost of the assets can be measured reliably.
Software is recorded initially at cost and then amortised over its useful life, usually three years, on a straight-line basis as an operating expense.
It is included in the balance sheet as an intangible asset.
Where appropriate, impairment losses may be reversed in future if the recoverable amount increases.
Intangible assets held by subsidiary operations in a foreign currency are translated at the closing rate.
Any gain or loss on translation is included in other comprehensive income.
In 2010, a charge for impairment of 2.1 million 2009: 2.7 million was taken in respect of reduced expected future cash inflows from entities acquired by the Group.
A discount rate of between 13.1 per cent.
was used in calculating the estimated levels of impairment.
The Group has future commitments to purchase software with a value of 0.3 million 2009: 0.4 million.
15 Property, plant and equipment The Groups assets include long leasehold premises, leasehold improvements, office equipment, computers and cars.
Property, plant and equipment is held at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes both the original purchase price of the asset and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided on the cost less the estimated residual value at the end of its economic life over their useful lives on a straight-line basis at rates varying between 20 per cent.
Depreciation rates and methods, as well as the residual values at the end of the useful life, underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recorded in the income statement as an operating expense.
Property, plant and equipment held by subsidiary operations in a foreign currency are translated at the closing rate.
Estimates and judgements The carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date.
An assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired: if any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.

16 Associates and joint ventures Associates comprise those undertakings where the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control.
Joint ventures comprise those undertakings where there is contractually agreed sharing of control over the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee requiring unanimous consent.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate or joint venture.
The income statement includes the Groups post-tax share of associates and joint ventures profits or losses for the year.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in that associate or joint venture.
Where associates and joint ventures hold financial assets classified as available-for-sale, the Group recognises its share of movements in such assets in other comprehensive income.
Where the Group has investments in funds over which it is able to exert significant influence but not control, the Group has applied the scope exclusion within IAS 28 Investments in Associates for mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities and has accounted for such holdings as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Such investments are accounted for as financial assets see note 18.

17 Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities The Group operates a unit-linked life assurance business through the wholly-owned subsidiary, Schroder Pension Management Limited the Life Company.
The Life Company provides investment products through a life assurance wrapper.
The investment products do not provide cover for any insurance risk and are therefore recognised and accounted for as financial instruments.
Assets held to cover unit-linked liabilities represent financial assets and comprise investments in authorised unit trusts, other financial assets and cash.
All assets excluding financial assets not at fair value such as cash and accrued income held at amortised cost have been designated as fair value through profit or loss, representing assets held to cover third party obligations.
Where the Life Company has a controlling interest in an authorised unit trust, this investment is consolidated and the third party obligation includes other investors in the authorised unit trust.
Further details of the Groups accounting policy for financial assets are set out in note 18.
The Life Companys assets are regarded as current assets as they represent amounts available to unit-linked policyholders or third party investors in authorised unit trusts who are able to withdraw their funds on call, subject to certain restrictions in the case of illiquidity.
Unit-linked liabilities comprise both obligations to policyholders of the Life Company financial liabilities to Life Company investors and obligations to other third party investors in the authorised unit trusts that are consolidated due to the Life Companys controlling interest financial liabilities due to third party investors.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp082 130. indd 101 15 03 2011 20:39 102 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 17 Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities continued Unit-linked liabilities comprise: 2010 2009 m m Financial liabilities due to life company investors 7,439.3 5,062.9 1 Financial liabilities due to third party investors 834.1 645.1 8,273.4 5,708.0 1 Such liabilities arise in respect of assets controlled by the Group that are beneficially owned by third parties.
Gains and losses from assets held to cover unit-linked liabilities are attributable to the Life Company policyholders or third party investors inthe consolidated authorised unit trust.
As a result, any gain or loss is offset by a change in the Groups obligation.
Fees earned by the Group are included in net revenue.
As is common practice in the industry, the Life Company has granted floating charges over its long-term assets to any policyholders reinsured by the Life Company.
The floating charges convert into fixed charges in the event of the insolvency of the Life Company.
The charge ensures that such policyholders rank equally with direct policyholders in the event of the insolvency or winding-up of the Life Company.
The Group has no exposure to market risk and negligible exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk in relation to the investments of the Life Company as the risks and rewards associated with its investments are borne by the investors in the Life Companys funds and not by the LifeCompany itself.
The risk and return of the financial assets for the investors are managed through investment in a range of investments, including through authorised unit trust vehicles.
Credit risk is normally borne by policyholders in respect of liquidity risk, when policyholders withdraw funds from the Life Company business and, if in the Groups reasonable opinion it is required, the Group may delay payment by 30days and in the case of real estate by 180 days.
The Group is not required to surrender all units at the same time and may surrender units insuch numbers at such intervals over the relevant period as the Group considers appropriate.
Fair value measurements of Life Company financial assets and liabilities The Life Company holds and issues financial instruments that are measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Life Companys financial instruments at the balance sheet date are analysed as follows: 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial Total m m m instruments not m at fair value m Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 7,345.1 111.4 87.3 729.6 8,273.4 Unit-linked liabilities 8,232.9 33.9 6.6 8,273.4 2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial Total m m m instruments not at m fair value m Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 5,353.3 26.7 61.3 266.7 5,708.0 Unit-linked liabilities 5,708.0 5,708.0 Instruments classified as Level 1 principally comprise investments in quoted equities, daily priced funds, gilts, amounts due to unit-linked policyholders and exchange-traded derivatives.
Investments classified as Level 2 principally comprise corporate bonds and foreign exchange contracts.
Investments classified as Level 3 principally comprise investments in private equity and hedge funds.
There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the year.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp082 130. indd 102 15 03 2011 12:49 103 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 17 Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities continued Movements in financial assets categorised as Level 3 during the year were: 2010 2009 m m At 1 January 61.3 64.6 Total gains losses recognised in the income statement 2.5 3.3 Additions 24.0 Disposals 0.5 At 31 December 87.3 61.3 Private equity fund valuations are normally supplied to the Group by the funds investment advisors and subsequently reviewed and validated internally by the Group.
When reviewing valuations, the Group considers such factors as valuations of relevant comparable investments, current industry trading multiples and the materiality of any differences in valuation between in-house estimations and the valuations received from third parties.
At the year-end, there were no significant differences between valuations supplied to us by third parties and those derived from reasonably possible alternatives as produced by the Groups in-house models.
In respect of hedge funds, the process is similar in that the funds are valued by a third party with subsequent internal review by the Group.
TheGroup has limited visibility as to the assumptions inherent in the valuations it receives, although validation checks can be performed by comparing discrete returns with movements in publicly-available indices.
At the year-end, the Group was not aware of any significant differences between the valuations received and reasonably possible alternatives explored by the Group.
Estimates and judgements in respect of the determination of fair values are set out in note 18.

Effective from 1 July 2008, the Group adopted the amendment to IAS 39 issued in October 2008 and reclassified held for trading financial assets out of the fair value through profit or loss category and into the available-for-sale category.
The carrying value of the reclassified financial assets at 31 December 2010 is 42.0 million 2009: 67.5 million.
Financial assets are classified as either available-for-sale, at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or held to maturity.
Recognition and measurement All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred andthe Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Where financial assets have been categorised as being available-for-sale or at fair value through profit or loss, all such investments are initially recognised at fair value, being the consideration given, including, in respect of assets classified as available-for-sale, acquisition costs associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, the investments are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
All financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, except for those held within the Life Company see note 17, are classified as held for trading.
Derivative contracts are included at fair value at the balance sheet date within Financial assets or Financial liabilities.
Fair value represents the amount at which a derivative could be exchanged in a transaction at the balance sheet date between willing parties.
For investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to official quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
For investments that are not actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by using quoted prices from third parties such as brokers, market makers and pricing agencies.
For private equity investments where there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined with reference to International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines or by independent professional valuers.
In such circumstances, fair values are derived using the most appropriate technique, examples of which include the use of earnings multiples applying an appropriate earnings multiple to the earningsof individual businesses being valued in order to derive a value and the values assigned to recent similar transactions.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity.
Such assets are categorised as loans and receivables, unless they are quoted in an active market and the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold such assets to maturity, in which case, the Group is able to categorise such investments as held to maturity.
Both loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are held exclusively by the Groups Private Banking operations.
All investments are initially recognised at fair value, being theconsideration given, including, where appropriate, acquisition charges Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp082 130. indd 104 15 03 2011 12:49 105 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 18 Financial assets continued associated with the investment.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost, being the measurement on initial recognition lessprincipal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction directly or through the use of an allowance account for impairment orirrecoverability.
Hedge accounting Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, the Group formally documents the relationship between the derivative and any hedged item, its risk management objectives, its strategy for undertaking the various hedging transactions and its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value of hedged items.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the instrument is derecognised.
In relation to hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised within net revenue in the income statement.
On disposal of the foreign operation, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised directly in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.
The Group has a total net investment in collective investment vehicles of 89.6 milion 2009: 70.9 million and received distributions of 0.3million 2009: 0.3 million that, by virtue of the investment management agreements in place between the Group and those vehicles, areconsidered to be related parties.
Fair value measurements The Group holds financial assets that are measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined in note 17.

Estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets are discussed below.
Valuation of quoted financial assets where there is no active market From time to time quoted investments held by the Group may not be actively traded in financial markets.
In such cases, the Group uses price feeds from third party market participants to determine fair value.
Valuation of financial assets where there is no quoted price Such assets principally consist of investments in private equity, venture and buy-out funds, hedge funds and funds of hedge funds.
Private equity, venture and buy-out funds are valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines and, where appropriate, by independent professional valuers.
Hedge funds and funds of hedge funds are valued using the last price, quoted by the relevant fund adjusted to reflect changes in underlying market conditions occurring between the date of the last quoted price and the balance sheet date.
These determinations require significant judgement particularly in determining changes in fair value since the last formal valuation by the fund manager or advisor.
In making this judgement the Group evaluates amongst other factors the effect of cash distributions and changes in the business outlook for each fund due to the financial health and performance of individual investments within each fund.
Impairment of financial assets categorised as available-for-sale Assets categorised as available-for-sale are reviewed at the end of each reporting period for impairment.
If the period-end fair value of anasset is less than the cost or deemed cost of that asset, the Group will assess whether there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
In respect of equity products, consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value of an instrument is below cost and to the length oftime that the fair value of an instrument has been below cost.

Impairments for specific bad and doubtful debts are made against loans and advances made by the Group to reflect an assessment of irrecoverability and are deducted from the relevant assets.
Such impairments are determined based on revised estimates of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate and are recorded within Operating expenses in the income statement.
2010 2009 m m Loans and advances to customers 841.6 964.2 Included within loans and advances to customers are amounts owed by related parties of 0.6 million 2009: 1.2 million.
During the year, no loans and advances 2009: 1.2 million were made to related parties and 0.6 million 2009: nil was repaid.
All related party loans and advances were at normal commercial rates.
Factors considered in determining whether impairment has taken place include how many days past the due date a receivable is, deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, and knowledge of specific events that could influence a debtors ability to repay an amount due.
Provisions of 17.4 million 2009: 9.6 million are held against gross loan and advances to customers of 52.1 million 2009: 21.5 million.
Collateral of 31.2 million 2009: 10.0 million is held against the gross balances.
20 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Impairments for specific bad and doubtful debts are made against receivables to reflect an assessment of irrecoverability and are deducted from the relevant assets.
Such impairments are recorded within Operating expenses in the income statement.

Where the Group considers that such items are not to be used for settling its liabilities, for example, securities with short maturity dates that will be rolled over as part of an investment portfolio, they are classified as financial assets rather than cash and cash equivalents.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts where such facilities form an integral part of the Groups cash management.

Derivative contracts are held for trading.
Loan notes and bank borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction and issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses on derivative contracts and liabilities of consolidated funds are recognised within net revenue in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised.
Any gain or loss on derecognition of bank borrowings and loan notes are recognised within Net finance income in the income statement.

23 Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all taxable and deductible temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
However, if the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

These have been recognised based on the share prices as at 31 December 2010.
If the asset were recognised at the closing share price on 8 March 2011 then deferred tax assets would be reduced by 1.6 million, of which nil would be recognised as a charge in the consolidated income statement.
A deferred tax asset of 11.3 million 2009: 12.9 million relating to realised and unrealised capital losses has not been recognised as there is insufficent evidence that there will be sufficient taxable gains in the future against which the deferred tax asset could be utilised.
A deferred tax asset of 27.3 million 2009: 34.9 million relating to losses and other temporary differences has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable profit against which these losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
This unrecognised deferred tax includes an amount of 6.1 million 2009: 14.9 million relating to US losses of 17.6 million 2009: 42.6 million, which are subject to a minimum expiry period of 12 years.
The aggregate amount of gross temporary differences regarding investments in subsidiaries is 12.5 million 2009: 14.5 million.
Deferred tax has not been provided as the relevant parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary diferences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Estimates and judgements in respect of deferred tax are set out in note 10.
24 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that anoutflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the existence of an obligation is possible, dependent on uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group, or a present obligation cannot be measured reliably, or it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required tosettle the obligation, the Group discloses a contingent liability but does not record a provision see note 35.
Where the Group expects to recover amounts provided, for example under an insurance contract, the recovery is recognised as a separate asset but only when the recovery is virtually certain.

None of the Groups provisions are individually significant.
Estimates and judgements The timing and amount of settlement of each legal and constructive obligation is uncertain.
The Group has performed an assessment of the timing and amount and periodically reviews this assessment.
For certain provisions, including the provision for onerous leases, there isgreater certainty as the cash flows have largely been determined.
However, the onerous lease provision also includes an assessment of potential cash inflows where these are not contractually binding from sub-letting arrangements.
The Group makes periodic assessment of all cash flows, including taking external advice where appropriate, to determine an appropriate provision.
Some obligations may be settled through commercial negotiation as well as being covered by the Groups insurance arrangements.
The Group has made provisions based on a reasonable expectation of likely outflows.
However, the results of negotiations and insurance cover may result in different settlement.

In addition, operational, liquidity and credit risk exposures exist within the business.
The effectiveness of the Groups risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Groups senior management.
The Risk and Compliance functions are responsible for monitoring the overall risk environment.
The Group has established a control environment that ensures risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In addition, an independent assessment of the risk management process and the fundamental risk assumptions is provided by Internal Audit.
The financial risks of these products arelargely borne by the third party investors, consistent with other investment products managed by the Group.
However, since the Life Company provides the investment products, both the investments and the third party obligations are recorded on the balance sheet.
Financial instrument risk management in respect of the Life Company is set out in note 17.
Capital management The Groups capital is divided between Operating capital consisting of Asset Management and Private Banking capital and Group capital.
Operating capital Operating capital is the capital required to meet the Groups regulatory and working capital requirements.
The Group holds a surplus of capital over the regulatory capital requirements and where this is in excess of the long-term working capital requirements it is transferred toGroup capital.
Recognised regulatory bodies, such as the Financial Services Authority FSA in the UK, oversee the activities of many of the Groups operating subsidiaries and impose minimum capital requirements on the subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is that subsidiaries should have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, keep an appropriate standing with counterparties and meet working capital requirements.
The Group Capital Committee reviews this.
Schroders plc is regulated by the FSA as a UK consolidated group.
Its last submitted capital resources, using the calculation of capital resources of banks, are 1,266 million 2009: 1,286 million and Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements of 294 million 2009: 258 million.
The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process carried out in 2010 under Pillar 2 concluded that 526 million 2009: 590 million capital should be retained.
This is determined to be the regulatory and long-term working capital requirement and Operating capital is maintained at this level.
All regulated entities within the Group complied at all times with all of the externally imposed regulatory capital requirements.
Group capital Group capital is used to seed new investment strategies, co-invest selectively alongside our clients and finance organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
It is deployed in accordance with limits approved by the Board.
Group capital is the capital that is not required for the regulatory and working capital requirements of the business.
It is invested in the following principal areas: Cash Debt securities Third party hedge funds Multi-asset class investments Emerging market debt, currency and commodities Private equity Seed capital Seed capital supports the growth in operating business and is deployed principally to generate asset management revenue growth.
Group capital is also held to assist existing products and businesses and to accelerate their development: to support the organic development of new businesses that fit with the existing asset management franchise: and to respond to other investment and growth opportunities, such as acquisitions that will accelerate the development of the business, as they arise.
The remainder of the Group capital is principally invested selectively to maintain liquidity and to generate a LIBOR return on investments.
The Group Capital Committee regularly reviews the hedging policy.

The Groups exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of its financial assets.
The Groups primary exposure to financial instrument risk is derived from the financial instruments.
In addition, due to the nature of the business, the Groups exposure extends to the impact on investment management and other fees that are determined on the basis of a percentage of funds under management and are therefore impacted by the financial instrument risk exposure of our clients the secondary exposure.
This section deals with the primary exposure only.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that Schroders counterparty to a financial instrument will cause the Group financial loss by failing to discharge an obligation.
For this purpose, the impact on fair value of a credit loss in a portfolio of investments is excluded.
This risk is addressed within Pricing Risk below.
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Group carefully manages its exposure to credit risk by approving policies including types of acceptable collateral and minimum lending margins, setting limits for individuals exposures and sectors and by taking security.
Credit risk arising from loans and advances to customers, fee debtors and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents All individual facility requests are presented to the relevant Private Banking credit committees and exposures against limits are monitored daily.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets less any collateral held on its loans and advances to customers.
Loans and advances to customers are normally secured, on initial lending, on a range of assets including property both residential and commercial, cash, client portfolios and insurance policies.
It is the policy of the Groups Private Banking entities not to advance client facilities on an unsecured basis.
Portfolios held as collateral are marked to market daily and positions compared to customer loans.
Limits are set for the reduction in market value of each type of collateral, depending on the perceived risk associated with the collateral.
Clients are contacted once these limits are breached so that action can be taken before the outstanding loan balances exceed the fair value of the collateral.

Historically, default levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
Although the Group is usually managing client cash representing a large multiple of the amount owed to the Group by the client, the Group does not hold any of the assets it invests on behalf of its clients as collateral.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents are concentrated in its Private Banking entities and fall within their treasury portfolios.
The remainder of the Groups cash and cash equivalents is invested primarily in current accounts and on deposit with well-rated UK and overseas banks.
The Groups fee debtors and other debtors that are past due but are not considered to be impaired are presented below: 2010 2009 m m Not older than 30 days 0.3 0.4 Older than 30 days not older than 45 days 0.4 1.5 Older than 45 days not older than 60 days 0.8 2.5 Older than 60 days not older than 90 days 2.8 1.7 Older than 90 days not older than 120 days 0.3 Older than 120 days not older than 180 days 0.6 0.3 Older than 180 days 0.3 0.2 5.5 6.6 Credit risk arising from debt securities and derivatives Most debt securities within the Private Banking treasury book are held until maturity and are unsecured.
Policies and limits are set by the relevant Private Banking credit committees and monitored daily.
All of the treasury portfolio is rated Aor better.
The portfolio has no exposures to emerging markets, sub-investment grade assets or any asset-backed securities.
The Private Banking entities take a conservative approach to their treasury investments with counterparties being well-rated UK and overseas banks and government securities.
The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to credit risk arising from debt securities and derivatives within the investment portfolio by adopting a conservative approach to investing.
Within the cash and Government Bond portfolios, deposits are placed with well-rated banks that have beenapproved and continuously monitored by Group Risk management.
The Government Bond portfolio is concentrated in AAA-rated Government Bonds and Government guaranteed financials.
Derivative positions are taken in exchange traded securities where there is minimalcredit risk.
Outstanding settlement balances are restricted to forward foreign exchange positions with a general maturity of one month.
A breakdown of the Groups relevant financial assets by credit rating is set out below.
The Group had no debt security 2009: none balances that were past due and not impaired.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Schroders cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The principal liquidity risk the Group faces concerns its Private Banking liabilities.
The liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash flow funding, meet allobligations as they fall due and maintain solvency of the Private Banking entities as well as the rest of the Group.
The expected maturity of financial liabilities is set out in the relevant notes.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp082 130. indd 116 15 03 2011 21:05 117 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 27 Financial instrument risk management continued In terms of non-Private Banking liquidity, the Groups policy is that its subsidiaries should trade solvently and have adequate capital for allactivities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, all companies should have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, keep an appropriate credit standing with counterparties, and maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
The Group has some liquidity risk in respect of the Life Company.
However there are redemption deferrals available to delay settlement where liquidity concerns may be detrimental to investors or the Group.
Further details are set out in note 17.
The Group has a committed multi-currency loan facility of 250 million 2009: nil, of which 19 million was drawn in October 2010 and remained drawn at the balance sheet date.
The amount borrowed was repaid in January 2011.
The facility expires on 27 September 2013.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Private Banking In the Private Banking entities, interest rates are monitored against policies and limits set by the relevant risk committee.
Private Bankings treasury policy is to hedge fixed-rated assets and liabilities, beyond one year, back to the floating rate as much as possible and therefore outright interest rate risk arises mainly from the decision to allow a limited amount of mismatch between the interest cash inflows and outflows.
Within Private Banking, there are sensitivity-based and stress-based bases used for monitoring interest rate risk.
These involve assessing the impact on Schroders net worth against a prescribed basis point rise in interest rates with one extreme scenario for the stress test.
The impact is calculated regularly and for each currency and in aggregate.
Interest rate risk in Private Banking is limited due to the short-term nature of the Private Banking entities financial assets.
In the case of changes in market interest rates, the Private Banking treasurer can reprice the assets within an average of between two and three months 2009: between two and three months.
Other operating companies and Group capital Cash held by the other operating companies is not normally expected to be placed on deposit for longer than three months.
The Groups capital includes investments in fixed income managed by the Groups fixed income fund managers.
These investments are managed to a maximum average duration of two years.
The fund managers may reduce the average duration with the use of future contracts at their discretion.
The Groups borrowings at 31 December 2010 were at a fixed rate with a predetermined repayment date at par.
The borrowing was therefore not exposed to changes in interest rates.
1 Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2010, if interest rates had been 200 basis points higher nil lower 2009: 250 basis points higher nil lower with all other variables held constant, the Group estimates that post-tax profit for the year would have increased decreased by 10 million nil 2009: increased decreased by 18 million nil respectively, mainly as a result of higher lower interest income on the Groups floating rate debt securities andcash: other components of equity would have been unaffected.
The following are underlying assumptions made in the model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits in Private Banking: The fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
Within Private Banking, the fixed rate financial assets will be repriced to the higher lower market interest rates.
The average term for repricing is between two and three months.
The following are underlying assumptions made in the model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits in the rest of the Group: The fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
Funds would be reinvested in similar variable interest-bearing debt securities on maturity.
1 Sensitivities are measured against market risk movements which the Group believes could reasonably occur within the next calendar year.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp082 130. indd 117 15 03 2011 12:50 118 Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 27 Financial instrument risk management continued Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Private Banking In the Private Banking entities, some loans and advances to clients as well as a proportion of the treasury activities are undertaken in foreign currencies: however, this is hedged on a daily basis to reduce currency exposures to low levels.
Limits regarding the amount of foreign currency risk that the Group is exposed to are set by the relevant risk committee and monitored daily.
Given the low level of currency mismatch, the FSAs Basic Methodology for calculating the exposure is used.
Other operating companies The Groups policy in relation to revenue and expenditure currency exposure is generally not to hedge, as the Groups revenue is earned and expenditure incurred in many currencies and the resulting exposure is considered part of the business.
The Group currently does not hedge its investment in foreign operating companies but reconsiders this position from time to time.
Group capital The Group has exposure to foreign currency through investments in currencies other than sterling.
These investments are normally held through foreign operations and therefore any currency gain or loss on translation is normally recorded in the statement of other comprehensive income.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts with third parties to mitigate exposure to currency movements.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is also normally included in the statement of other comprehensive income.
The use of such instruments is subject to the approval of the Group Capital Committee.
The Groups gross and net exposure to foreign currencies is set out below: 2010 2009 Gross Hedged Net exposure Gross Hedged Net exposure m m m m m m US dollar 485 394 91 575 474 101 Euro 325 183 142 259 91 168 Swiss franc 149 149 129 129 Australian dollar 43 24 19 26 14 12 Hong Kong dollar 52 52 23 23 Japanese yen 31 12 19 20 20 Other 95 95 90 90 Total currency exposures 1,180 613 567 1,122 579 543 Sterling 617 613 1,230 526 579 1,105 1,797 1,797 1,648 1,648 1 Sensitivity analysis As set out in the table above, the principal gross exposure to foreign currency at 31 December 2010 was US dollar and the Euro.
The Group estimates that, at 31 December 2010, if the US dollar had strengthened by ten per cent.
against sterling with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit of the year would have increased decreased by 5 million 5 million 2009: increased decreased by 8 million 6 million respectively, principally as a result of the increase decrease in assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, other components of equity would have increased decreased by 10 million 10 million 2009: increased decreased by 7million 6 million respectively, principally as a result of the unhedged portion of net investment in foreign operations.
The Group estimates that, at 31 December 2010, if the euro had strengthed by eight per cent.
against sterling with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have increased decreased by 9 million 11 million 2009: increased decreased by 2 million 2 million respectively, principally as a result of the increase decrease in assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, other components of equity would have increased decreased by 13 million 16 million 2009: increased decreased by 18 million 22 million respectively, principally as a result of the unhedged portion of net investment in foreign operations.

In respect of financial instrument risk, the Groups exposure to other pricing risk is principally through investments held in Group capital.
However, the more significant risk is the impact on the Groups fee income as these are principally determined on basis points of the fair valueof funds under management.
This risk cannot be easily mitigated but is addressed to some extent by ongoing net sales.
The principal components of Group capital are set out above.
The exposure to other pricing risk is monitored by the Group Capital Committee on a regular basis.
The Group does not hedge exposure to other price risks except in respect of seed capital and fund awards made to employees when it is considered that the amount of risk is material and an effective hedge is available.
1 Sensitivity analysis The Group estimates that, at 31 December 2010, if the FTSE All Share Index had been 20 per cent.
higher lower with all other variables heldconstant, the effect on post-tax profit would be an increase decrease of 51 million 51 million 2009: increase decrease by 30 million 38million respectively, principally as a result of an increase decrease in management fees receivable: other components of equity would increase decrease by 16 million 16 million respectively 2009: increase decrease by 14 million 8 million, principally as a result of fairvalue gains and losses on the Groups unhedged available-for-sale assets.
The following are underlying assumptions made in the model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits and other components of equity: Changes in the FTSE All Share Index correlate to changes in the Groups equity funds.
Performance fees, being principally based on returns relative to specified indices, would be unaffected by changes in the index.
The Groups investment in debt securities and hedge funds have no correlation to the FTSE All Share Index.
The Groups private equity investments are correlated to the FTSE All Share Index.
The market risk on the Groups seed capital is hedged effectively, except for property investments, which are assumed to have no correlation to the FTSE All Share Index.
Fair value The Groups required disclosures in respect of the fair value of financial instruments that are held at fair value in the balance sheet are included in note 17 unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities, note 18 financial assets and note 22 financial liabilities.
28 Derivative contracts a Why the Group uses derivatives The Group holds derivatives mainly for risk management and customer facilitation purposes.
Risk management: the Group actively seeks to limit and manage its exposures to risk where that exposure is not desired by the Group.
This may take the form of unwanted exposures to a particular currency, type of interest rate or other price risk.
By entering into derivative contracts, the Group is able to mitigate or eliminate such exposures.
The principal risk the Group faces through such use of derivative contracts is credit risk.
For details of how the Group manages its exposures to credit risk, see b below and note 27.
Customer facilitation: the Groups Private Banking entities are involved in providing portfolio management, banking and investment advisory services, primarily to private clients.
In carrying out this business they transact as agent and principal in financial assets and liabilities in order to meet customer facilitation requirements.
Private Bankings policy is to hedge, as appropriate, exchange rate and interest rate risk on its customer facilitation positions using foreign exchange and interest rate contracts.
This hedging of equal and opposite risks seeks to mitigate market risk, but does not eliminate the possibility of credit risk.

Currency forwards are contractual obligations to receive or pay amounts based on changes in currency rates or to buy or sell foreign currency or a financial instrument on a future date at a specified price, established in anorganised financial market.
For currency forward contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange ofcurrencies or interest rates for example, fixed rate for floating rate or a combination of all these for example, cross-currency interest rate swaps.
Noexchange of principal takes place, except for certain currency swaps.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the swap contracts.
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts and the liquidity of the market.
To control the level of credit risk taken, the Company assesses counterparties using the same techniques as for its lending activities.
Foreign exchange, equity and interest rate options are contractual agreements under which the seller writer grants the purchaser holder the right, but not the obligation, either to buy a call option or sell a put option at or by a set date or during a set period, a specific amount of a foreign currency or a financial instrument at a predetermined price.
The seller receives a premium from the purchaser in consideration for the assumption of foreign exchange, equity or interest rate risk.
Options may be either exchange-traded or negotiated between the Group and a customer or market counterparty OTC.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on purchased options tothe extent of their carrying amount, which is their fair value.

The derivative instruments become favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities asa result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, foreign exchange rates and other relevant variables relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable, and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities, can fluctuate significantly from time to time.

36 Awards to employees of rights to share-based payments The Group makes share-based payments to key employees through awards over or linked to the value of ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares and by the grant of market value share options over non-voting ordinary shares.
The Group has the following share-based payment arrangements: 1999 Share Option Plan: Options over non-voting ordinary shares were granted to executive Directors and other key employees.
Under the 1999 Share Option Plan the performance target of all option holders, including executive Directors, was that the Groups earnings per share growth defined as the earnings per ordinary share before any exceptional items, as derived from the Groups Annual Report andAccounts must be at least two per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over a minimum five-year period.
Thisperformance condition was in line with market practice at the time of the award.
The Group no longer grants awards under this plan.
2000 Share Option Plan: Under this plan, the Group grants market value share options over non-voting ordinary shares to executive Directors and other key employees.
Options usually become exercisable if the option holder remains with the Group for at least three years and, for executive Directors, the performance target has been met.
The performance target, in line with market practice, is that the Groups earnings per share growth defined as for the 1999 Share Option Plan above must be at least four per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over the initial three-year period.

These awards are subject to forfeiture and will vest on the third anniversary provided the participant continues to be employed within the Group.
Further details are given in the remuneration report.
All of the above share-based payment arrangements involve a maximum term of ten years for each option granted and are settled through the transfer of shares of the Company to employees.
Share Incentive Plan: Under this scheme approved by HM Revenue & Customs, eligible employees can purchase ordinary shares in the Company each month up to 1,500 per taxation year from their gross salary.
In April 2006, the Group began to match employee share purchases up to 50 per month.
These matching shares are effectively free shares awarded to the employee subject to their remaining in employment for one year.
2008 Equity Incentive Plan: Under this scheme, eligible employees receive awards of ordinary shares, normally structured as rights to acquire shares at nil cost.
These awards are subject to forfeiture and will vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant, provided the employee continues to be employed within the Group.
2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan: Under this scheme, eligible employees receive awards of either ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares, normally structured as rightsto acquire shares at nil cost.
These awards are subject to forfeiture and will vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant, provided theemployee continues to be employed within the Group.
The number of awards that will vest depends on growth in earnings per share and net new business over a four-year period.
Options granted over non-voting ordinary shares under the Groups Share Option Plan are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Thefair value determined is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a stochastic option valuation model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Awards over ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares made under the Groups Equity Compensation Plan are charged at fair value as Operating expenses in the income statement.
The fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of grant, discounted for the dividends forgone over the average holding period of the award.
The fair value charges, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting, are spread over the performance period and the vesting period of the awards.
Awards over ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares made under the Groups Equity Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan are charged at fair value to theincome statement over five and four year vesting periods respectively.
Fair value under the Groups Equity Incentive Plan is determined at the date of grant and is equal to themarket value at that time.
For awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan fair value is calculated using the market value of shares on the date of grant, discounted for dividends forgone over the vesting period of the award.
Awards that lapse are credited to the income statement in the year in which they lapse.
Certain employees have been awarded cash-settled equivalents to these share-based awards.
