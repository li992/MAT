SHARE CAPITAL The principal trading market for the Ordinary Shares is the London Stock Exchange.
The Ordinary Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs.
Each ADS represents five Ordinary shares.
The ADS facilityis sponsored by The Bank of New York Mellon acting as depositary.
All the Ordinary Shares, including those held by directors and executive officers, rank pari passu with each other.
On 23 January 2006 the Ordinary Shares of 12 2 9 pence were redenominated as Ordinary Shares of US 20 cents following approval by shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting in December 2005.
The new US Dollar Ordinary Shares carry the same rights as the previous Ordinary Shares.
The share price continues to be quoted in Sterling and the ADSs continue to represent five Ordinary Shares.
In 2006 the Company issued 50,000 of shares in Sterling in order to comply with English law.
These were issued as Deferred Shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange.
They have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value.
These shares were allotted to the Chief Executive, although the Boardreserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Boardshould it so wish.
Shareholdings As at 23 February 2011, 6,910,750 ADSs equivalent to 34,553,750 Ordinary Shares or approximately 3.9% of the total Ordinary Shares in issue, were outstanding and were held by 91 registered holders.
As at 23 February 2011, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 20,410 registered holders of Ordinary Shares, of whom 83 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of 214,806 Ordinary Shares less than 0.1% of the total issued.
Because certain Ordinary Shares are registered in the names of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the US is not representative of the number of beneficial owners of OrdinaryShares resident in the US.
