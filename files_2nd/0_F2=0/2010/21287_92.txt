17 Risk management policies and procedures for the Group and Company As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives as stated on the inside front cover and in the business review.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks: market risk comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk, and the directors approach to the management of these risks, are set out below.
The Board of directors and the Manager coordinate the Groups risk management.
The Board determines the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and these are set out below under the relevant risk category.
The policies for the management of risk have not changed from the previous accounting period.
17.1 Market risk The fair value of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises market price risk see note 17.1.
2 and interest rate risk see note 17.1.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the fair value of the quoted and unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely reporting of relevant information from the Manager.
Investment performance is reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Board monitors the Managers compliance with the Companys objectives, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation, including as between countries and economies.
The Groups exposure to changes in market prices on its investments was as follows: 31 October 31 October 2010 2009 000 000 Equities 518,530 433,883 Fixed interest 3,582 19,079 522,112 452,962 R&A Text 10 01 2011 16:40 Page 50 50 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.1.

This level of change is considered to be reasonable based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk A significant proportion of the Groups assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Groups functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The Manager monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies on a regular basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
The Manager measures the risk to the Group of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Groups net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rate to which the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings may be used to limit the Groups exposure to future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings are limited to 35% of the adjusted net asset value.
Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company did not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
During the year, derivative contracts were not used to hedge against exposure to currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Groups monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 October are shown overleaf.
Where the Groups equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The table overleaf illustrates the sensitivity of the total profit after tax for the year and the net assets in regard to movements in the Groups foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates for the US Dollar Sterling, Euro Sterling, Japanese Yen Sterling and Hong Kong Dollar Sterling.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US Dollar Sterling - 10% 2009: 10%.
These percentages are deemed reasonable based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities held at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable from cash at bank, the current asset investment and the value of the fixed interest investments.
Management of the risk The Group finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
