The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in use.
These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and income attributable to such reserves.
Cash flows are based on reserve production lives varying from one to fifteen years.
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10% compared to 8% in 2009, the change having an impairment impact of 1.2m in the year.
The prices of oil and natural gas are derived from published futures prices, with the long-term average oil price assumed to be US$90.97bbl 2009 US$88.01bbl and the long-term average gas price at US$5.10 mcf per 1,000 cubic feet.
A decline in the long-term average gas price from US$6.63 mcf in 2009, together with a review of oil and gas reserves, resulted in an impairment impact of 4.1m in the year.

Results for the Financial Year In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income.
A profit of 44.3m 2009 24.6m has been accounted for in the financial statements of the Company.
Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.

Goodwill for 2009 has been restated to recognise additional goodwill of 0.8m on the acquisition of the Welltonic group of companies in December 2009, which is reported as part of the Well Intervention segment.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as follows: Restated 2010 2009 m m Continuing operations: Well Construction 60.3 15.6 Well Completion 6.4 6.3 Well Intervention 32.4 31.8 Gibson Shipbrokers 1.2 1.2 Total 100.3 54.9 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and are based on past experience and order books.
Cash flows beyond the two year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates between 3% and 5%, which decline over time.
The growth rate reflects the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU operates.
Cash flows are discounted using pre-tax rates between 8.9% and 12.3% 2009 8%.
The discount rate best reflects the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the CGU.
Consideration has also been given to other risks such as currency risk and country risk.
Having performed a sensitivity analysis, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

Gibsons started publishing financial information publicly for the first time in 2010, which the Group used to perform a valuation of the equity warrant as at 31 December 2010, based on a multiple applied to Gibsons reported EBITDA.
This valuation technique used a significant number of unobservable inputs, including managements views about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the equity warrant, such as its marketability and Gibsons maintainable earnings.
In light of the public availability of financial information and an improving global economic outlook, together suggesting an improving financial performance of Gibsons, the Group was able to conclude a revised fair value of 44.9m.
The 15.3m 2009 1.3m increase in the fair value of the equity warrant during the year has been recognised in other comprehensive income as separately disclosed within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
This comprises 12.8m 2009 nil due to the revaluation of the equity warrant at 31 December 2010 and 2.5m 2009 1.3m due to foreign exchange differences.
Management consider that changing certain inputs, such as Gibsons EBITDA and the earnings multiple, to reasonably possible alternative assumptions, would change the fair value of the equity warrant significantly.
A 10% variance in Gibsons EBITDA would have an estimated impact of 10m on the value of the equity warrant and a 10% variation in the earnings multiple would have a similar impact.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2010 is the fair value of the financial assets of 45.1m 200929.8m, see note 29.

The reversal of impairment of 0.1m and the impairment charge of 1.5m in 2009 related to a non-trading subsidiary that had incurred losses and which the Directors did not expect to be fully recovered in the foreseeable future.
The investment has been stated at the subsidiarys net asset value, being the Directors estimate of the recoverable amount.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by the deviation in future expected cash flows calculated by reference to the movement in market quoted exchange rates.
The carrying values of available for sale unlisted investments are based on the Directors best estimate of fair value as there is no active market in which these are traded.
The fair values of non-sterling denominated financial instruments are translated into sterling using the year end exchange rate.

Financial Risk Factors The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk and cash flow interest risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge its risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, the investment of surplus cash, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
a Foreign exchange risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of US dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
i Transactional risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and currency swaps.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than 250,000 equivalent per month and or currency flows that in aggregate exceed 500,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.

Financial Risk Factors continued The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

ii Translational risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
Average rate options are used to reduce translation risk on the Groups consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% of budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling.
These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
b Interest rate risk Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits and overdrafts expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and has used interest rate swaps, caps and floors, when considered appropriate.
The Group needs to ensure that sufficient liquid funds are available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions.
During the year, cash was, therefore, invested by the treasury function in AAA rated, instant access Money Market Funds and in fixed-rate bank deposits, with terms of between overnight and four months.
As the funds were invested for short periods of time, the interest yield on these was relatively low.
However, the preservation of the Groups net cash took priority over earning high interest yields.
c Credit risk The Groups credit risk arises from its available for sale financial assets, pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Financing transactions are with leading financial institutions, which have Fitch long-term ratings between A and AA, and no losses are expected from non-performance of these counterparties.
Cash is only invested with financial institutions approved by the Board.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions all have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating and AAA rating for Money Market Funds from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies.

Financial Risk Factors continued Cash and cash equivalents of 268.7m 2009 403.6m and investments of 2.5m 2009 nil have been deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 and AAA rated Money Market Funds and are expected to be fully recovered.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Net derivative financial assets of 0.5m 2009 0.1m have been taken out with financial institutions, which have Fitch short-term ratings of F1 and are expected to be fully recovered.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The Company operates a pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with pension plan assets of 5.5m 2009 8.0m.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been affected by using three insurers, so as to spread its credit risk.
The credit ratings of these insurers is monitored.
d Liquidity risk The Group needs to ensure that is has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions.
All subsidiaries submit weekly, bi-monthly and quarterly treasury reports to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient net cash and credit facilities to meet both its longand short-term requirements.
The credit facilities totalled 153.9m 2009 181.9m and comprise 120.0m 2009 135.0m of committed facilities and 33.9m 2009 46.9m of uncommitted facilities.
All of these facilities are unsecured and are provided by a variety of funding sources.
The committed facilities comprise a 120.0m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of three banks.
The 120.0m multi-currency loan facility expires on 25 October 2013.
A commitment fee of 0.6% is payable on the undrawn amount.
The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year end: 2010 2009 m m Floating rate: Expiring within one year 135.0 Expiring between two and five years 120.0 120.0 135.0 Surplus funds have been placed in short-term deposits with approved banks and with AAA rated Money Market Funds.

Financial Risk Factors continued e Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2010.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net cash, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2010.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions but including onerous leases and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.

Provisions continued The Group has commitments in respect of leasehold properties, some of which are not used for Group trading purposes and are vacant or sub-let to third parties.
The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
It is expected that 2.4m of the provision will be utilised in 2011, 2.6m in 2012 and the remaining balance of 12.5m utilised from 2013 to 2023.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 1% and 4% pa, for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning and remediation obligations relate to the Groups obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment.
The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in meeting this obligation.
The provision is expected to be utilised over a period of one to fifteen years.
Following the disposal of Gibson Energy in 2008, the Group recognised a provision for tax indemnities.
These provisions are expected to be utilised in 2011.
The Group expects the other provisions of 0.1m to be fully utilised in 2011.
Post Employment Benefits Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to final salary and a defined contribution section.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the defined benefit section was closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution section.
The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance policies, meaning that pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
This is demonstrated by the stability of the pension asset from year to year.
However, the obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
During the year, the Trustees paid additional funds into the existing insurance policies to secure further benefits for members.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme is produced and updated annually to 31 December 2010 by independent qualified actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation assumes that benefits at present continue to be linked to the RPI measure of inflation.
The Trustees of the Scheme are seeking clarification on how the Governments recent announcement relating to the minimum level of increases that must be provided will impact the Scheme.
The main assumptions used for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December were: 2010 2009 Annual rates Rate of increase in salaries 5.6% 5.7% Rate of increase in pensions 3.6% 3.7% Discount rate 5.4% 5.6% Inflation 3.6% 3.7% The post-employment mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The mortality table implies that a 65 year old male currently has an expected future lifetime of 24.1 years 2009 24.0 years and an expected future lifetime of 27.3 years 2009 27.1 years for a male reaching 65 in 20 years time.
The mortality table implies that a 65 year old female currently has an expected future lifetime of 25.7 years 2009 25.6 years and an expected future lifetime of 27.6 years 2009 27.5 years for a female reaching 65 in 20 years time.
Based upon past experience, pension increases have been assumed to be in line with inflation.

Capital Risk Management The Groups capital consists of equity.
At the year end, total equity was 594.6m 2009 561.8m.
It is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Groups activities, having due regard to interest rate and currency risks and the availability of borrowing facilities.
The gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is monitored regularly against both internal targets and external covenant requirements.
However, the Group had net cash at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
The Group needs to ensure that banking and other borrowing covenants are complied with to ensure that borrowing facilities remain in place.
The covenants are monitored on a monthly basis and all external covenant requirements were met during the year.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, rights issues of share capital.
The Groups net cash debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses.

A final dividend of 8.3p per share has been proposed by the Board, amounting to a distribution of 10.9m.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 20April 2011 and has not been provided for in these financial statements.
Share-based Payments Executive Share Options The Company operates an executive share option scheme which grants options to eligible employees.
Vesting of options granted is subject to the achievement of performance targets, as described in the Remuneration Committees Report, over a three year period.
Thereafter the employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which to exercise the option.

Share-based Payments continued Options are valued using an option pricing model based on the binomial model, but adjusted to model the particular features of the options.
The assumptions used in calculating the charge to the income statement, which only relates to options granted after November 2002 as permitted by IFRS 2, are as follows: Date of grant 04.03.2008 06.03.2007 08.03.2006 09.03.2005 Exercise price p 784.5 640.0 383.0 220.7 Share price at grant p 784.5 640.0 383.0 236.0 Expected volatility % pa 32 36 38 38 Dividend yield % pa 1.1 1.17 1.31 1.59 Risk-free interest rate % pa 4.3 4.9 4.3 4.9 Turnover rates % pa 5 5 5 5 Fair value at grant p 294.9 248.4 149.8 91.0 Fair value adjusted for rights issue p n a n a n a 85.1 Assumed likelihood of satisfying performance condition at: 31 December 2009 75% 75% 100% 100% 31 December 2010 75% 100% 100% 100% The assumption for early exercise is 50% when options are 20% in the money.
The expected volatility is calculated as the historic volatility of the Hunting PLC share return over the five years prior to each grant date.
The charge to the income statement attributable to Executive Share Options is 0.6m 2009 0.6m and is recognised as part of operating expenses.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 676.6p 2009 505p.
Share-based Payments continued Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP annual conditional awards of shares may be made to executive Directors and senior employees.
Awards are subject to performance conditions and continued employment during the vesting period.
The PSP is a share award scheme and as such there is no exercise price.
The PSP awards made in the year will vest subject to total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period from date of grant, relative to comparator companies from the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services sector index and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector index.
Details of the PSP award movements during the year are set out below: 2010 2009 Number Number of awards of awards Outstanding at beginning of the year 182,038 Granted during the year 288,135 182,038 Vested during the year 1,294 Lapsed during the year 18,767 Outstanding at the end of the year 450,112 182,038 Details of each PSP award outstanding at 31 December 2010 are as follows: Number Number of shares of shares 2010 2009 Normal vesting date Date of grant: 29 April 2009 167,977 182,038 28.04.12 26 February 2010 282,135 25.02.13 Outstanding at the end of the year 450,112 182,038 The fair value of the PSP award granted in 2010 was calculated using the Stochastic pricing model also known as the Monte Carlo model, which incorporates the effect of the TSR performance condition.
The assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2010 2009 Assumptions: Weighted average share price at grant 587.5p 444.25p Expected volatility Hunting PLC 44.4% 44.4% Expected volatility Comparator group 58.3% 57.1% Risk free rate 1.8% 1.9% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 401.64p 251.47p The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years prior to grant, equal in length to the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected volatilities of each constituents of the comparator group are calculated on the same basis and input into the model individually and the average of these figures is shown in the table above.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk free rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares which make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The weighted average share price at the date of vesting was 645.0p.
The accounting charge of the PSP is adjusted for an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period and forfeit a proportion of their award.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture lapse rate is 2.5% per annum.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the PSP is 0.4m 2009 0.1m, which is recognised in operating expenses.
