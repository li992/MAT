Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 101 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 22 Financial instruments Derivatives are used to hedge exposure to market risks and those that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and the Groups hedging policies are further described below.
Finance income of 20m 2009 finance costs of 30m resulted from hedge ineffectiveness.
Fair value hedges The Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by the Group.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement under the effective interest rate method.
A loss of 65m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a gain of 85m on hedged items 2009 a gain of 1,197m on hedging instruments was offset by a loss of 1,227m on hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains and losses are deferred in equity.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur and will affect the Group Income Statement within one year of the balance sheet date.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Group Income Statement.
Net investment hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency swaps to hedge the exposure of a proportion of its non-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group has a South Korean Won denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income Statement on disposal of the overseas operation.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting The Groups policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where gains and losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item offset in the Group Income Statement.
These instruments include caps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
The Group has a liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, dunnhumby Limited.
Changes in the value of the liability are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.

Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides written principles for risk management, as described in the Business Review on pages 41 to 44.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Debt issued at fixed rates exposes the Group to fair value risk.
Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 44.
The Group has RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index.
RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt.
The Group also has LPI debt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%.
LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.

106 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Note 23 Financial risk factors continued The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives.
The potential cash outflow of 15.6bn is considered acceptable as it is offset by financial assets and trade receivables of 12.9bn 2009 16.9bn offset by financial assets and trade receivables of 13.9bn.
The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the balance sheet date.

Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged.
These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in note 22.
Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK.
The Group hedges a proportion of its investments in its international subsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are formally designated as net investment hedges.
These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 107 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 23 Financial risk factors continued The impact on Group financial statements from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below.
Sensitivity analysis The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on the retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
However, it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resulting from all local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 27February 2010.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.
It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded directly in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on the Group Income Statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the interest payable part of the calculation: and the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result from changes in UK interest rates, and in exchange rates: 2010 2009 Income Equity Income Equity gain loss gain loss gain loss gain loss m m m m 1% increase in GBP interest rates 2009 1% 38 59 15% appreciation of the Euro 2009 25% 13 43 22 22 10% appreciation of the South Korean Won 2009 20% 82 1 222 25% appreciation of the US Dollar 2009 25% 1 8 11 218 25% appreciation of the Thai Baht 2009 25% 1 1 10% appreciation of the Czech Koruna 2009 25% 31 204 5% appreciation of the Polish Zloty 2009 15% 14 A decrease in interest rates and a depreciation of foreign currencies would have the opposite effect to the impact in the table above.
The impact on equity from changing exchange rates results principally from foreign currency deals used as net investment hedges.
The impact on equity will largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets.
For changes in the USD GBP exchange rate, the impact on equity results principally from forward purchases of US Dollars as cash flow hedges.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them or issue new shares.
In April 2006, the Group outlined its plan to release cash from its property assets, via a sequence of property joint ventures and other transactions, and return significant value to shareholders, either through enhanced dividends or share buy-backs.
The target for the value of share buy-backs was increased from 1.5bn to 3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007.
Whilst the Group continued with the policy at the beginning of 2009, it subsequently used the proceeds from property divestment to pay down debt, following the two major acquisitions in 2009 Homever and Tesco Bank.
During 2009 the Group purchased and cancelled 100m ordinary shares.
In the financial year 2010 the Group continued to use the proceeds from the sale of property to pay down debt, which it expects to continue in 2011.
The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding.
This policy continued during the current year with bonds redeemed of 390m 2009 524m and new bonds issued totalling nil 2009 4,901m.
The Group borrows centrally and locally, using a variety of capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet the requirements of each local business.
108 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Note 23 Financial risk factors continued Tesco Bank Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in Tesco Banks banking activities have different repricing dates.
Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates.
Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long term are measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits.
Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over 12 months to a 1% parallel movement in interest rates.
Tesco Bank also use value at risk VaR for risk management purposes with a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence interval of 95%.
Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument.
Credit risk Credit risk is the probability of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to Tesco Bank and arises principally from Tesco Banks lending activities but also from other transactions involving on and off-balance sheet instruments.
Limits have been established for all counterparties based on their respective credit ratings.
The limits and proposed counterparties are reviewed and approved by the Risk Management Committee RMC of Tesco Bank.
Internal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit ratings.
Internal ratings are used to assess the credit quality of borrowers.
Customers are assigned credit ratings, based on various credit grading models that reflect the probability of default.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed on a consolidated basis within Tesco Banks banking activities and adheres to the liquidity requirements set by the Financial Services Authority FSA from time to time.
To meet regulatory requirements a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid and marketable assets is maintained.
Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis.
Tesco Bank has credit facilities sufficient to meet all foreseeable outflow requirements as they fall due and its liquidity risk is further mitigated by its well diversified retail deposit base.
Expressed as an annual probability of default, the upper and lower boundaries and the midpoint for each of the asset quality grades are as follows: At 27 February 2010 and 28 February 2009 Annual probability of default Minimum Midpoint Maximum S&P Asset quality grade % % % equivalent AQ1 0.00 0.10 0.20 AAA to BBBAQ2 0.21 0.40 0.60 BB to BB AQ3 0.61 1.05 1.50 BBto B AQ4 1.51 3.25 5.00 B to B AQ5 5.01 52.50 100.00 B and below Accruing NonImpairment AQ1 AQ2 AQ3 AQ4 AQ5 past due accrual provision Total At 27 February 2010 m m m m m m m m m Assets: Other investments 863 863 Loans and advances to customers 501 381 762 1,495 838 76 373 314 4,112 Loans and advances to banks and other financial assets 144 144 Total assets 1,508 381 762 1,495 838 76 373 314 5,119 Commitments note 33 3,926 1,329 573 452 184 6,464 Total off balance sheet 3,926 1,329 573 452 184 6,464 Accruing NonImpairment AQ1 AQ2 AQ3 AQ4 AQ5 past due accrual provision Total At 28 February 2009 restated m m m m m m m m m Assets: Other investments 259 259 Loans and advances to customers 352 652 828 870 563 82 291 250 3,388 Loans and advances to banks and other financial assets 1,541 1,541 Total assets 2,152 652 828 870 563 82 291 250 5,188 Commitments note 33 3,103 1,451 744 305 129 5,732 Total off balance sheet 3,103 1,451 744 305 129 5,732 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 109 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 23 Financial risk factors continued Insurance risk Tesco Bank is exposed to insurance risk indirectly through its profit sharing commission arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.
Insurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency or severity of insured events, relative to the expectations at the time of underwriting.
The frequency and severity of claims and the sources of uncertainty for the key classes that Tesco Bank is exposed to are as follows: Motor insurance Claims experience is quite variable, due to a wide range of factors, but the principal ones are age, gender and driving experience, type and nature of vehicle, use of vehicle and area.
There are many sources of uncertainty that will affect Tesco Banks experience under motor insurance including operational risk, reserving risk, premium rates not matching claims inflation rates, the weather, the social, economic and legislative environment and reinsurance failure risk.
Property insurance The major causes of claims for property insurance are theft, flood, escape of water, fire, storm, subsidence and various types of accidental damage.
The major source of uncertainty is the volatility of weather.

ii The Irish Savings-related Share Option Scheme 2000 permits the grant to Irish employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 12 and 320 per four-weekly period.
iii The Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 was adopted on 17 October 1994.
The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the Discretionary Share Option Plan 2004.
There were no discounted options granted under this scheme.
iv The Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 was adopted on 7 June 1996.
v The International Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 was adopted on 20 May 1994.
This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK executives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts.
The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a threeyear period.
vi The Executive Incentive Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004.
This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
vii The Performance Share Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004 and amended on 29 June 2007.
Options granted before 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between four and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
Options granted after 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over a three-year period.
viii The Discretionary Share Option Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004.
This scheme permits the grant of approved, unapproved and international options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at a price not less than the middle-market quotation or average middle-market quotations of an ordinary share for the dealing day or three dealing days preceding the date of grant.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme.
ix The Group New Business Incentive Plan 2007 was adopted on 29 June 2007.
Options will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of grant and will be exercisable for up to two years from the vesting dates for nil consideration.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over the seven-year plan.
The average share price during the year ended 27 February 2010 was 380.05p 2009 372.06p.
The fair value of share options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The following table gives the assumptions applied to the options granted in the respective periods shown.
No assumption has been made to incorporate the effects of expected early exercise.

The measure of volatility used in the Groups option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
In estimating the future volatility of the Companys share price, the Board considers the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.
b Share bonus schemes Eligible UK employees are able to participate in Shares in Success, an all-employee profit-sharing scheme.
Each year, shares are awarded as a percentage of earnings up to a statutory maximum of 3,000.
Eligible Republic of Ireland employees are able to participate in a Share Bonus Scheme, an allemployee profit sharing scheme.
Each year, employees receive a percentage of their earnings as either cash or shares.
Senior management also participate in performance-related bonus schemes.
The amount paid to employees is based on a percentage of salary and is paid partly in cash and partly in shares.
Bonuses are awarded to eligible employees who have completed a required service period and depend on the achievement of corporate targets.
The accrued cash element of the bonus at the balance sheet date is 52m 2009 33m.
Selected senior management participate in the senior management Performance Share Plan.
Awards made under this plan will normally vest three years after the date of the award for nil consideration.
Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over a three year performance period.
Senior management in the US business also participate in the US Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 which was adopted on 29 June 2007.
The awards made under this Plan will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of award, for nil consideration.
Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed in the US business over the seven-year plan.
112 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Note 27 Share-based payments continued The Executive Directors participate in short-term and long-term bonus schemes designed to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Full details of these schemes can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The fair value of shares awarded under these schemes is their market value on the date of award.
Expected dividends are not incorporated into the fair value except for awards under the US Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit pension schemes for the Groups employees in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Defined contribution plans The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 12m 2009 11m have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
Defined benefit plans United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees.
Towers Watson Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2008, using the projected unit method.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation the actuarial deficit was 275m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 3,987m and these assets represented 94% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
During the year, the One Stop Senior Executive Pension Scheme was merged into the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme.
As the One Stop Scheme was already part of the Group there has been no impact on the overall disclosures.
The One Stop Scheme had a net liability of 4.6m at 28 February 2009.
Overseas The most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit pension scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 1 April 2007.
The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 27 February 2010.
The schemes assets are stated at their market values as at 27 February 2010.
Towers Watson Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation.
The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with IAS 19, and are incorporated in the following tables.
Principal assumptions The valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 27 February 2010.
The major assumptions, on a weighted average basis, used by the actuaries were as follows: 2010 2009 % % Rate of increase in salaries 3.6 3.7 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.4 3.1 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.6 3.2 Rate of increase in career average benefits 3.6 3.2 Discount rate 5.9 6.5 Price inflation 3.6 3.2 In excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP element.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 140m and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by approximately 17m.
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 113 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 28 Post-employment benefits continued UK mortality assumptions The Company conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008, the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes: Base tables: PMA92C00 for male members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be one year younger than actual age.
PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age.
These assumptions were used for the calculation of the pension liability as at 27 February 2010 for the main UK scheme.
As at 27 February 2010, the mortality assumptions have been strengthened.
The base tables have been updated in line with medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum from 31 March 2008 to 27 February 2010.
In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements has been changed to incorporate medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum.
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 at the same date 25 years: 2010 2009 in years in years Retiring at Reporting date at age 65: Male 21.6 21.5 Female 23.4 23.3 Retiring at Reporting date 25 years at age 65: Male 24.0 23.9 Female 25.9 25.8 Rates of return on scheme assets The assets in the defined benefit pension schemes and the expected nominal rates of return were: 2010 2009 Long-term Market Long-term Market rate of return value rate of return value % m % m Equities 8.7 2,521 8.9 1,482 Bonds 5.1 1,233 5.5 1,080 Property 7.0 343 7.3 342 Other alternative assets 8.7 484 8.9 383 Cash 4.1 115 3.7 133 Total market value of assets 4,696 3,420 The expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective returns expected on the separate asset classes.
The expected rate of return on equities and cash have both been set having regard to expected returns over the medium term, as calculated by the Companys independent actuary.
The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly from actual yields for gilts and corporate bond stocks.

The cost of providing these benefits has been accounted for on a similar basis to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The liability as at 27 February 2010 of 12m 2009 10m was determined in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
In 2010, 0.7m 2009 0.7m has been charged to the Group Income Statement and 0.5m 2009 0.5m of benefits were paid.
A change of 1.0% in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: 2010 2009 m m Effect of a 1% increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rate on: Service and interest cost 0.1 0.1 Defined benefit obligation 1.5 1.6 Effect of a 1% decrease in assumed healthcare cost trend rate on: Service and interest cost 0.1 0.1 Defined benefit obligation 1.5 1.3 Expected contributions A formal actuarial valuation is carried out triennially for the scheme trustees by a professionally qualified independent actuary.
The purpose of the valuation is to agree a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The actuarial valuation of approved schemes as at 31 March 2008 has been concluded and the Groups contributions are increasing to 11.1% from 10.9%.
On this basis the Group expects to make contributions of approximately 430m to defined benefit pension schemes in the year ending 27 February 2011.

118 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Note 33 Commitments and contingencies continued Contingent liabilities The Company has irrevocably guaranteed the liabilities, as defined in Section 5 c of the Republic of Ireland Amendment Act 1986, of various subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the Republic of Ireland.
For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see note 11.
There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability to the Group.
The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment can be reliably estimated.
In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading issued its provisional findings in its Statement of Objections relating to the alleged collusion between certain large supermarkets and dairy processors.
On 30 April 2010, the Office of Fair Trading announced that it had decided to drop the allegations against the Group in relation to milk and butter in the dairy investigation.
The Office of Fair Trading agreed a discretionary penalty discount of 10% for the Group not contesting the two remaining allegations which related to cheese.
The Group has however made no admission of wrongdoing.
The discounted fine will become payable after the OFT issues its decision later this year and is immaterial to the Group and therefore no provision has been recognised in the Groups financial statements.
Tesco Bank At 27 February 2010, Tesco Bank has commitments of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, totalling 6.5bn 2009 5.7bn.
The amount is intended to provide an indication of the potential volume of business and not of the underlying credit or other risks.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS is the UK statutory fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms and pays compensation if a firm is unable to pay claims against it.
The FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury to fund these compensation costs associated with institutions that failed in 2008 and will receive receipts from asset sales, surplus cash flow and other recoveries from these institutions in the future.
The FSCS meets its obligations by raising management expense levies.
These include amounts to cover the interest on its borrowings and compensation levies on the industry.
Each deposit-taking institution contributes in proportion to its share of total protected deposits.
The levy is calculated based on deposit balances held as at 31 December in each year and as such, this is seen as the trigger event under accounting rules.
If the FSCS does not receive sufficient funds from the failed institutions to repay HM Treasury in full it will raise compensation levies.
At this time it is not possible to estimate the amount or timing of any shortfall resulting from the cash flows received from the failed institutions and, accordingly, no provision for compensation levies has been made in these financial statements.
Note 34 Capital resources The following table shows the composition of regulatory capital resources of Tesco Personal Finance PLC being the regulated entity at the balance sheet date: 2010 2009 m m Tier 1 capital: Shareholders funds and minority interests 576 521 Tier 2 capital: Qualifying subordinated debt 235 205 Other interests in tier 2 capital 21 19 Supervisory deductions 263 259 Total regulatory capital 569 486 The movement of tier 1 capital during the year is analysed as follows: 2010 2009 m m Beginning of the year 521 514 Share capital and share premium 230 Profit attributable to shareholders 37 7 Ordinary dividends 153 Increase in intangible assets 59 End of the year 576 521 Tesco Personal Finance PLC was acquired as part of Tesco Personal Finance Group Limited on 19 December 2008.
It is Tesco Personal Finance PLCs TPF policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently throughout its activities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying risks of the business.
In carrying out this policy, TPF has regard to the supervisory requirements of the Financial Services Authority FSA.
The FSA uses Risk Asset Ratio RAR as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a banks capital resources with its risk-weighted assets the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are weighted to reflect the inherent credit and other risks : by international agreement the RAR should be not less than 8% with a Tier 1 component of not less than 4%.
TPF has complied with the FSAs capital requirements throughout the year.
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 119 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 35 Leasing commitments Finance lease commitments Group as lessee The Group has finance leases for various items of plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings.
There are also a small number of buildings which are held under finance leases.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximate to their carrying value.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases and hire purchase contracts, together with the present value of the net minimum lease payments are as follows: Present value of Minimum lease payments minimum lease payments 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Within one year 49 55 45 47 Greater than one year but less than five years 101 140 90 114 After five years 178 172 74 82 Total minimum lease payments 328 367 209 243 Less future finance charges 119 124 Present value of minimum lease payments 209 243 Analysed as: Current finance lease payables 45 47 Non-current finance lease payables 164 196 209 243 Operating lease commitments Group as lessee Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Within one year 1,043 754 Greater than one year but less than five years 3,702 3,069 After five years 10,004 9,170 Total minimum lease payments 14,749 12,993 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its retail, distribution and office properties and other assets such as motor vehicles.
The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group has lease break options on certain sale and leaseback transactions, which are exercisable if an existing option to buy back leased assets at market value at a specified date is also exercised, no commitment has been included in respect of the buy-back option as the option is at the Groups discretion.
The Group is not obliged to pay lease rentals after that date and so minimum lease payments exclude those falling after the buy-back date.
Operating lease commitments with joint ventures Since 1988, the Group has entered into several joint ventures and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures.
The terms of these sale and leasebacks vary, however, common factors include: the sale of the properties to the joint venture at market value, options within the lease for the Group to repurchase the properties at market value, market rent reviews and 20-30 year lease terms.
The Group reviews the substance as well as the form of the arrangements when making the judgement as to whether these leases are operating or finance leases: all of the leases under these arrangements are operating leases.
Operating lease receivables Group as lessor The Group both rents out its properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases.
At the balance sheet date, the following future minimum lease payments are contractually receivable from tenants: 2010 2009 m m Within one year 259 201 Greater than one year but less than five years 566 445 After five years 348 335 Total minimum lease payments 1,173 981 120 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
