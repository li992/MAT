During the year, the Company entered into a one year 40m multi-currency variable rate loan facility with Lloyds TSB.
The loan, which expires on 2 March 2011, was fully drawn down at 30 April 2010 in sterling at an interest rate of 2.0%.
During the year the Company also entered into a 30 year interest rate swap for 40m which locks in the rate banks charge to each other.
The net effect of these two transactions is that part of the cost of borrowing over the next thirty years has been locked in but the smaller element that is determined by the additional margin banks charge non-bank customers has only been fixed for a year.
Taking the two transactions together, the interest rate on the 40m of additional borrowing at the year end was 5.3%.
More details of the interest rate swap are shown on page 44.
The main covenants relating to the loan are: i total borrowings shall not exceed 30% of the Companys adjusted investment portfolio value: ii the Companys investment portfolio value shall not fall below 550m: iii the Company shall not have fewer than 50 investments: and iv the Company shall not change its investment manager without prior written consent of the lender.
There were no breaches of loan covenants during the year.
