Financial statements Parent company financial statements of BP p. l. c. Notes on financial statements 1.
Accounting policies Accounting standards These financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
Foreign currency transactions Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any resulting exchange differences are included in profit for the year.
Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency branches are translated into US dollars are taken to a separate component of equity and reported in the statement of total recognized gains and losses.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries and associated undertakings are recorded at cost.
The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Share-based payments Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which equity instruments are granted and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company market conditions.
Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, where this is within the control of the employee.
No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognized in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognized over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognized over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognized if this difference is negative.
When an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognized in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value and recognized as an expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability recognized on the balance sheet.
Pensions The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Past service costs are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change in pension plan design.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognized in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognized in the income statement as other finance income or expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full within the statement of total recognized gains and losses in the year in which they occur.
The defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The surplus or deficit, net of taxation thereon, is presented separately above the total for net assets on the face of the balance sheet.

Accounting policies continued Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Use of estimates The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.

Pensions The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
With effect from 1 April 2010, BP closed its UK plan to new joiners other than some of those joining the North Sea SPU.
The plan remains open to ongoing accrual for those employees who had joined BP on or before 31 March 2010.
The majority of new joiners have the option to join a defined contribution plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2010.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main UK pension plan was as at 31 December 2008.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions used to evaluate accrued pension at 31 December in any year are used to determine pension expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2010 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension cost for 2011.
% Financial assumptions 2010 2009 2008 Expected long-term rate of return 7.3 7.4 7.5 Discount rate for plan liabilities 5.5 5.8 6.3 Rate of increase in salaries 5.4 5.3 4.9 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.5 3.4 3.0 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.5 3.4 3.0 Inflation 3.5 3.4 3.0 Our discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.
Our assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
This includes allowance for promotion-related salary growth of 0.4%.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
Years Mortality assumptions 2010 2009 2008 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 26.1 26.0 25.9 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 29.1 29.0 28.9 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 28.7 28.6 28.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 31.6 31.5 31.4 The market values of the various categories of asset held by the pension plan at 31 December are set out below.
The market value of pension assets at the end of 2010 is higher when compared with 2009 due to an increase in the market value of investments when expressed in their local currencies and partially offset by a decrease in value that arises from changes in exchange rates decreasing the reported value of investments when expressed in US dollars.
Movements in the value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail below.

The share-based payment plans that existed during the year are detailed below.
All plans are ongoing unless otherwise stated.
Plans for executive directors Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP share element An equity-settled incentive plan for executive directors with a three-year performance period.
For share plan performance periods 2008-2010 the award of shares is determined by comparing BPs total shareholder return TSR against the other oil majors ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Chevron.
For the performance period 2009-2011 the award of shares is determined 50% on TSR versus a competitor group of oil majors which in this period also included ConocoPhillips and 50% on a balanced scorecard BSC of three underlying performance measures versus the same competitor group.
For the period 2010-2012 the award of shares is determined one third on TSR versus a competitor group of oil majors identical to the 2009-2011 plan group and two thirds on a BSC of three underlying performance indicators.
After the performance period, the shares that vest net of tax are then subject to a three-year retention period.
The directors remuneration report on pages 112 to 121 includes full details of the plan.
Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP deferred matching share element Following the renewal of the EDIP at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, a deferred matching share element is in place requiring a mandatory one third of directors annual bonus to be deferred into shares for three years.
The shares are matched by the company on a one-for-one basis.
Vesting of both deferred and matching shares is contingent on an assessment of safety and environmental sustainability over the three-year deferral period and a director may voluntarily defer an additional one third of bonus into shares on the same terms.
Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP share option element An equity-settled share option plan for executive directors that permits options to be granted at an exercise price no lower than the market price of a share on the date that the option is granted.
The options are exercisable up to the seventh anniversary of the grant date and the last grants were made in 2004.
From 2005 onwards the remuneration committees policy is not to make further grants of share options to executive directors.
Plans for senior employees The group operates a number of equity-settled share plans under which share units are granted to its senior leaders and certain employees.
These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
Leaving employment during the three-year period will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply where the participant leaves for a qualifying reason.
Grants are settled in cash where participants are located in a country whose regulatory environment prohibits the holding of BP shares.
Performance unit plans The number of units granted is made by reference to level of seniority of the employees.
The number of units converted to shares is determined by reference to performance measures over the three-year performance period.
The main performance measure used is BPs TSR compared against the other oil majors.
In addition, free cash flow FCF is used as a performance measure for one of the performance plans.
Plans included in this category are the Competitive Performance Plan CPP, the Medium Term Performance Plan MTPP and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Restricted share unit plans Share unit grants under BPs restricted plans typically take into account the employees performance in either the current or the prior year, track record of delivery, business and leadership skills and long-term potential.
One restricted share unit plan used in special circumstances for senior employees, such as recruitment and retention, normally has no performance conditions.
Plans included in this category are the Executive Performance Plan EPP, the Restricted Share Plan RSP, the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.
BP Share Option Plan BPSOP Share options with an exercise price equivalent to the market price of a share immediately preceding the date of grant were granted to participants annually until 2006.
There were no performance conditions and the options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the grant date.
Savings and matching plans BP ShareSave Plan This is a savings-related share option plan under which employees save on a monthly basis, over a threeor five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted.
This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant.
The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract: otherwise it lapses.
The plan is run in the UK and options are granted annually, usually in June.
Participants leaving for a qualifying reason have six months in which to use their savings to exercise their options on a pro-rated basis.

Share-based payments continued BP ShareMatch Plans These are matching share plans under which BP matches employees own contributions of shares up to a predetermined limit.
The plans are run in the UK and in more than 60 other countries.
The UK plan is run on a monthly basis with shares being held in trust for five years before they can be released free of any income tax and national insurance liability.
In other countries the plan is run on an annual basis with shares being held in trust for three years.
The plan is operated on a cash basis in those countries where there are regulatory restrictions preventing the holding of BP shares.
When the employee leaves BP all shares must be removed from trust and units under the plan operated on a cash basis must be encashed.
Local plans In some countries BP provides local scheme benefits, the rules and qualifications for which vary according to local circumstances.
Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs ESOPs have been established to acquire BP shares to satisfy any awards made to participants under the BP share plans as required.
The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends on shares held for future awards and are funded by the group.
Until such time as the companys own shares held by the ESOP trusts vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is deducted in arriving at shareholders equity see Note 8.
Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.
At 31 December 2010 the ESOPs held 11,477,253 shares 2009 18,062,246 shares and 2008 29,051,082 shares for potential future awards, which had a market value of $82 million 2009 $174 million and 2008 $220 million.

Share-based payments continued The group uses a valuation model to determine the fair value of options granted.
The model uses the implied volatility of ordinary share price for the quarter within which the grant date of the relevant plan falls.
The fair value is adjusted for the expected rates of early cancellation.
Management is responsible for all inputs and assumptions in relation to the model, including the determination of expected volatility.

The group used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of the TSR element of the 2010, 2009 and 2008 CPP, MTPP and EDIP plans, and in 2009 and 2008 for the PSP plan.
In accordance with the rules of the plans the model simulates BPs TSR and compares it against our principal strategic competitors over the three-year period of the plans.
The model takes into account the historic dividends, share price volatilities and covariances of BP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the TSR element.
Accounting expense does not necessarily represent the actual value of share-based payments made to recipients, which are determined by the remuneration committee according to established criteria.
Auditors remuneration Fees payable to the companys auditor for the audit of the companys accounts were $17 million 2009 $13 million and 2008 $16 million.
Remuneration receivable by the companys auditor for the supply of other services to the company is not presented in the parent company financial statements as this information is provided in the consolidated financial statements.

Pension contributions During 2010 three executive directors participated in a non-contributory pension scheme established for UK staff by a separate trust fund to which contributions are made by BP based on actuarial advice.
Two US executive directors participated in the US BP Retirement Accumulation Plan during 2010.
Office facilities for former chairmen and deputy chairmen It is customary for the company to make available to former chairmen and deputy chairmen, who were previously employed executives, the use of office and basic secretarial facilities following their retirement.
The cost involved in doing so is not significant.
Further information Full details of individual directors remuneration are given in the directors remuneration report on pages 112 to 121.

Post balance sheet events On 14 January 2011, BP entered into a share swap agreement with Rosneft Oil Company whereby BP will receive approximately 9.5% of Rosnefts shares in exchange for BP issuing new ordinary shares to Rosneft, resulting in Rosneft holding 5% of BPs ordinary voting shares.
The aggregate value of the shares in BP to be issued to Rosneft is approximately $7.8 billion as at close of trading in London on 14 January 2011.
BP has agreed to issue 988,694,683 ordinary shares to Rosneft: Rosneft has agreed to transfer 1,010,158,003 ordinary shares to BP.
Completion of the transaction is subject to the outcome of the court application referred to in the paragraph below, and related pending arbitral proceedings.
After completion, BPs increased investment in Rosneft will continue to be recognized as an available-for-sale financial asset.
During the period from entering into the agreement until completion, the agreement represents a derivative financial instrument and changes in its fair value will be recognized in BPs income statement in 2011.
An application was brought in the English High Court on 1 February 2011 by Alfa Petroleum Holdings Limited APH and OGIP Ventures Limited OGIP against BP International Limited and BP Russian Investments Limited.
APH is a company owned by Alpha Group.
APH and OGIP each own 25% of TNK-BP, in which BP also has a 50% shareholding.
This application alleges breach of the shareholders agreement on the part of BP and seeks an interim injunction restraining BP from taking steps to conclude, implement or perform the previously announced transactions with Rosneft Oil Company relating to oil and gas exploration, production, refining and marketing in Russia.
Those transactions include the issue or transfer of shares between Rosneft Oil Company and any BP group company.
The court granted an interim order restraining BP from taking any further steps in relation to the Rosneft transactions pending an expedited UNCITRAL arbitration procedure in accordance with the shareholders agreement between the parties.
The arbitration has commenced and the injunction has been extended until 11 March 2011 pending an expedited hearing in relation to matters in dispute between the parties on a final basis during the week commencing 7 March 2011.
The expedited hearing will decide, among other matters, whether the injunction will be extended beyond 11 March 2011.
