Goodwill continued Cash generating units CGUs, comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying out impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash ows of these CGUs.
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 168.8 153.2 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 6.6 5.4 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Paci c business segment 11.1 10.2 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 95.9 90.3 282.4 259.1 The carrying value of goodwill and inde nite lived intangibles allocated to two CGUs, the USA and UK, is material relative to the total carrying value comprising 90% of the total.
The remaining 10% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 23 countries 23 cash generating units.
The goodwill and inde nite lived intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK cash generating units are set out below: Intangible Goodwill assets 2010 2009 m m m m USA 148.1 148.1 140.9 UK 95.9 11.2 107.1 101.5 Other cash generating units 38.4 38.4 27.9 282.4 11.2 293.6 270.3 The inde nite lived intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 2006 see note 13.
The recoverable amount of each of the CGUs above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present value of future cash ows attributable to the unit.
The value in use for each CGU has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each unit from the value in use of the Group as a whole.
Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also re ects external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as re ected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group.
While management believe that the projected cash ows are a reasonable re ection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term, in the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions used in the projected cash ows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each Group of CGUs: Future cash ows are based on budget for 2011 approved by the Board.
The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use.
Thereafter forecasts have been prepared by management for a further four years from 2012 that re ect an average annual growth rate of 3-5.4% and an increase in gross margins driven by improving global economic conditions from 2011.
This compared to forecasts used in the evaluation in the year ended 31 December 2009 that projected 3-5.5% growth but re ected a higher level of baseline cash ows.
These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods.
As a result gross margins and real operating pro ts at the end of the five year period remain either at or below the levels achieved in the year ended 31 December 2008.
Management consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position re ecting the current uncertain global economic conditions.
Cash ows beyond 2015 have been extrapolated using a 2.25% growth rate which management believe is a reasonable long term growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant CGUs operate.
A terminal value is included in the assessment re ecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long term nature of the businesses.
50 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 www.
indd 50 07 04 2011 09:16 Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder and Other Information The Group conducts a market risk assessment of CGUs in each country, with a country speci c pre-tax discount rate being applied to the future pre-tax cash ows for each CGU based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital for the Group.
This was unchanged from 2009 at 9%.
The underlying pre-tax rate therefore re ects current market assessments of the Group as a whole and is adjusted for risks speci c to such businesses in each country, giving a risk adjusted range of 12% to 17% 2009: 12% to 17% for the underlying CGUs.
A detailed review has been performed of the value in use models and the appropriate rate at which its cash ows are discounted for impairment test purposes.
The market risk adjustments added to the underlying CGU discount rates remain unchanged from 2009.
The trading conditions in which the Group operates are subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Current market conditions remain challenging for the Group and the current global conditions makes forecasting medium term cash ows more dif cult than is traditionally the case.
The forecast cash ows used to derive the value in use are sensitive to changes in revenues driven by changes in prices, occupancy or a combination of both, costs and discount rates including the market assessment of the risks of the Group re ected in the Groups market capitalisation.
Actual conditions could result in either better or worse cash ows than included in the value in use calculation.
Should current economic conditions prove to be more severe or more prolonged than currently expected this would adversely impact the forecast cash ows and could result in impairments to goodwill and inde nite lived intangible assets in future periods.
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the US CGU is suf ciently large to enable the Directors to conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge for this CGU.
The key assumptions used in the US model are that in 2011 the forecast centre contribution rises to 24% from 18%.
Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2011 giving a terminal 2015 centre gross margin of 26%.
Thereafter a 2.25% long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity.
The cash ows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 12% 2009: 12%.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a signi cant nature so as to result in most cash generating units carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount.
For the UK CGUs, however, a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used to determine the cash generating units recoverable amount could cause the units carrying amount to exceed its value in use.
For the UK, the goodwill and the inde nite life intangible brand in this CGU arose on acquisitions completed in 2006 principally the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business.
The value in use exceeded its carrying amount by 37 million 2009: 20 million and therefore no impairment was necessary at 31 December 2010.
During the year the Group re-negotiated a number of lease commitments, this has signi cantly lowered its cost base and contributed to the margin improvement in the forecast period.
The forecast cash ows assume an interim recovery reverting to mid-cycle revenue and occupancy being achieved in 2015 prior to the application of the long-run growth rate and the discount rate used.
Our model incorporates a recovery in pricing but not at the same rate as the decline in pricing experienced in recent years, the terminal value assumed in 2015 is below that experienced in 2008.
Whilst occupancy levels are forecast to increase over the period, the level set for the terminal value calculation represents a mid-cycle occupancy.
Revenue over the forecast period grows at an average of 5.4% p. a. from 2010.
All other variables held constant, a reduction in the growth rate of 0.5% would result in the carrying amount being equal to the value in use.
Management maintain that this would be offset by an increase in occupancy so that the carrying amount would be greater than the value in use.
A fall of 1.6% in the average gross margins from 2011 in the forecast period would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount.
Similar to 2009 the model assumes a mid-cycle gross margin in 2015 of 17%.
A reduction to 15% would result in the value in use being equal to the carrying amount.
The cash ows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14% 2009:14%.
The discount rate used is based on a risk adjusted Group WACC, re ecting the speci c risk pro le of the UK business such as the greater degree of competition in the UK market.
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used from 14% to 17.5% would result in its value in use being equal to its carrying amount.
There is no goodwill relating to the Groups joint ventures.

The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an inde nite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an inde nite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see note 12.
The remaining amortisation life for non-inde nate life brands is 14 years.

Of this balance, 23.4 million 2009: 47.0 million is pledged as security against outstanding bank guarantees and a further 9.2 million 2009: 17.3 million is pledged against various other commitments of the Group.
These amounts are blocked and not available for use by the business.
Liquid investments represent corporate bonds and cash placed on deposit by the Group with a maturity over three months.
Non-cash changes comprise the amortisation of debt issue costs, new finance leases entered into and movements in debt maturity.
Financial instruments and financial risk management The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are determined at Group level.
The Groups Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial Of cer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis.
The Chief Financial Of cer and Group Treasurer review the Groups risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis.
The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
The Audit Committee is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business.
The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
Going concern The Business Review on pages 8 to 9 of the Report and Accounts sets out the Groups strategy and the factors that are likely to affect the future performance and position of the business.
The financial review on pages 10 to 13 within the Business Review reviews the trading performance, financial position and cash ows of the Group.
A feature of the Group has been its strong cash ows and during the year ended 31 December 2010, despite the dif cult trading conditions, the Group has maintained its cash levels at comparable levels to the position at the start of the financial year.
Although many countries that the Group operates in continue to experience dif cult economic conditions, the directors believe that the Group is taking the necessary actions and expect to strengthen the current market leading position of the Group.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Following an internal review of the Groups facility arrangements in March 2009, and given the strength of the Groups cash position, the Board approved the early surrender of the 100 million revolving credit facility.
This decision does not impact the judgment of the directors that it is appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts.

indd 58 07 04 2011 09:16 Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder and Other Information Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversi ed customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts which contribute the majority of the Groups revenue minimise the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when speci c debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which re ects the Groups historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
Cash assets and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below: 2010 2009 m m Americas 18.9 21.0 EMEA 42.9 38.7 Asia Paci c 16.6 14.2 UK 24.2 23.4 102.6 97.3 All of the Groups trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and no individual customer has a material balance owing as a trade receivable.
The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2010 2010 2009 2009 m m m m Not overdue 94.3 0.6 86.5 0.2 Past due 0 30 days 6.6 0.3 8.8 0.7 Past due 31 60 days 2.3 0.4 3.3 0.8 More than 60 days 11.2 10.5 12.8 12.4 114.4 11.8 111.4 14.1 At the year end 31 December 2010, the Group maintained a provision of 11.8 million against potential bad debts 2009: 14.1 million arising from trade receivables.
The Group had provided 4.1 million 2009 14.1 million in the year and utilised 7.0 million 2009 7.1 million.
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its revenue in advance of the provision of of ce services and requires deposits from its customers.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have suf cient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group has free cash and liquid investments excluding blocked cash of 172.0 million 2009: 180.8 million which the directors consider adequate to meet the Groups day to day requirements.
In November 2010 the Group signed a three-year unsecured 80 million Bank Guarantee & Letter of Credit facility with Lloyds TSB bank.
This will allow the Group to release cash previously set aside to support guarantees.
The facility is subject to financial covenants covering operating cashows, the ratio of Gross Debt to consolidated tangible net worth and the ratio of EBITDAR to net interest and rental charges.
The Groups undrawn senior committed facility of 100 million was scheduled to expire on 19 March 2011, subject to the Group continuing to comply with the covenants of the facility agreement.
The covenants included the ratio of net debt to EBITDA: the ratio of cash ow to net debt service including net interest expense and scheduled debt repayments and the ratio of EBITDAR to net interest and rental charges.
In March 2009, the Board approved the early surrender of the 100.0 million revolving credit facility following an internal review of the Groups facility arrangements.
Of the facility approximately 50.0 million had been set aside to support bank guarantees provided against obligations of the Group.
In order to continue to support these, the Group deposited suf cient funds with the guaranteeing banks which reduced free cash available for use by an equivalent amount.
In so doing the directors considered the Groups forecast and sensitised cash ow projections and do not believe that this will have an adverse impact on the Groups liquidity given the strength of the Groups cash position.
Although the Group has net current liabilities of 75.2 million 2009: 46.5 million the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk.
A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income that will be recognised in future periods through the income statement.
Although the Group holds customer deposits of 163.2 million 2009:149.3 million these are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material.
Therefore the Group does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk.
The net current assets, excluding deferred income, were 50.6 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 68.2 million.
It is considered appropriate to exclude deferred income in assessing the liquidity of the Group as it re ects the future non-refundable contractual revenue of the Group to be recognised as revenue in future periods.
Market risk Interest rate risk Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis.
In order to maximise interest returns, surplus cash is also invested in AAA-rated corporate bonds and deposits with a maturity in excess of three months.
At the balance sheet date no corporate bond or deposit had a maturity in excess of three months.
Whenever possible, and subject to the operational requirements of the Group, cash is repatriated to the head of ce and managed by the Group Treasury department.
Foreign currency risk The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency.
Working capital balances are generally held in the functional currency of the overseas subsidiary and therefore the impact of the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities in the income statement of overseas subsidiaries is not considered to have a material impact on the Group.
The majority of the Groups net assets are in pounds sterling, US dollars and euros.
During the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group continued the policy of partially hedging the translation effect of certain pro ts incurred in foreign currencies including the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and certain East European currencies.
The policy aimed to reduce the impact on the reported pro ts of the Group from changes in the value of pounds sterling against the hedged currencies.
As at 31 December 2010, all foreign exchange derivative financial instruments had matured and no open positions were held.
Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency uctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks.
In the year ended 31 December 2010, the Group used derivative financial instruments to manage the translation risk of certain foreign currencies on the reported pro ts of the Group.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Other market risks The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices.

indd 60 07 04 2011 09:16 Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder and Other Information Capital management The Groups parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The Chief Financial Of cer monitors the diversity of the Groups major shareholders and further details of the Groups communication with key investors can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 18 to 23.
In 2006, the Board approved the commencement of a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders.
The Groups Chief Executive Of cer, Mark Dixon, is the major shareholder of the Company and all executive members of the Board hold shares in the Company.
Details of the Directors shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 25 to 30.
In addition the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share capital in the market.
In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both the need to issue shares under the Groups share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders.
In the year ended 31 December 2010 Regus plc purchased 1,353,188 2009: 627,258 of its own shares in the open market and utilised these to satisfy employee share awards.
Regus plc re-purchased 9,385,000, of its own shares in the open market and held these shares as treasury shares.
As at 21 March 2011, 9,070,906 shares were held as treasury shares.
The Company declared an interim dividend of 0.85p per share 2009: 0.8p during the year ended 31 December 2010 and proposed a final dividend of 1.75p per share 2009: 1.6p per share an 8% increase on the 2009 dividend.
There were no other changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Groups objective when managing capital equity and borrowings is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group holds minimal debt and is in a strong cash position therefore it is majority equity funded.
The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher levels of borrowings with the stability and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Groups return on capital employed for the year ended 31 December 2010, fide ned as operating pro t divided by total shareholders equity, was 1.4% 2009: 17.2%.

Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash ows at an appropriate discount rate which re ects current market assessments and the risks speci c to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at oating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Derivative financial instruments The Group held several foreign currency swaps in the year, all of which matured during the year.
The aggregate movement of the fair value of these instruments was a loss of 0.5 million 2009: gain 2.2 million.
The instruments were not designated as hedges and the gain has been recognised in the income statement.
No derivative financial instruments were held at the year end 2009: nil.

The proportion of the CIP awards that represented the deferred bonus for the year ended 31 December 2005 were released on 20 March 2009. c The CIP Matching Shares and Share Option Plan awards made in 2008 and 2009 did not have performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the date of the award.
A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these awards has been updated in the year ended 31 December 2010. d The LTIP awards have a release date of 23 March 2013.
The LTIP nil cost options have a vesting date of 23 March 2013 and an expiry of 23 March 2020.
The performance conditions are set out below.
The performance conditions for the grant of awards under the LTIP are set out in the following table: For November 2005 and March 2006 awards: Adjusted EPS p for the year ended 31 Dec 2008 11p 12p 13p 14p For September 2006 awards: % increase in adjusted EPS for year ended 30 June 2009 compared to EPS of prior year 15% 20% 25% 30% Growth in free cash ow per share 10% 6% 13% 19% 25% 15% 13% 25% 38% 50% 20% 19% 38% 56% 75% 25% 25% 50% 75% 100% Adjusted EPS It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion.
The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis.
As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees t at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments are currently anticipated: Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 67 www.

Share based payment continued In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive pro ts in future years.
Thus it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year.
Accordingly those costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from investing in new locations.
Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target.
This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash ow performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.
The performance conditions for awards under the matching share element of the CIP made in March 2007 are set out below: % increase in published EPS for the year ended 31 December 2009 compared to the published EPS for the prior year 15% 20% 25% 30% Growth in free cash ow per share over 3 years 10% 6% 13% 19% 25% 15% 13% 25% 38% 50% 20% 19% 38% 56% 75% 25% 25% 50% 75% 100% % denotes the % of the award which will be released at the end of the performance period.
In addition, no awards will be released unless the Companys TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of the companies comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector at the date of the grant subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The associated Investment Share awards made in March 2007 will be released to participants subject to any tax liabilities in accordance with the rules of the CIP.
As indicated in the Remuneration Report in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2008, the Remuneration Committee felt it inappropriate to set speci c performance conditions for Matching Shares under the CIP and options awards under the Share Option Plan awarded in March 2008 and March 2009 but were committed to carrying out a thorough review of the matter during 2009.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the following modi cations will be made to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and that the following performance conditions will apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010.

Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the first amount will not vest until March 2013, the second will not vest until March 2014 and the third will not vest until March 2015.
These vesting dates relate to the financial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively.
The vesting of these awards will be subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets.
75% of each of the three amounts will be subject to fide ned earnings per share EPS targets over the respective performance periods.
The remaining 25% of each will be subject to relative total shareholder return TSR targets over the respective periods.
The targets will be as follows: EPS targets for the financial years ending % of awards eligible for vesting 2012 2013 2014 25% 15p 17p 18p 50% 16p 20p 22p 75% 17p 23p 26p 100% 18p 26p 30p No shares will vest in each respective year unless the minimum EPS target for that year is achieved.

Key judgmental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported statements and related disclosures.
Fair Value accounting for business combinations For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company do not provide suf cient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculate an estimated fair value based on available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where managements judgment has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible xed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities.
For signi cant business combinations management also obtain third party valuations to provide additional guidance over the appropriate valuation to be included in the financial statements.
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and make that determination based upon future cash ow projections, which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur.
We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount.
Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2010, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, can be found in note 12.
Tax assets and liabilities We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately re ected in the accounting estimates.
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available against which the assets can be used.
The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable pro t in the previous year and is forecast to continue to make a pro t in the foreseeable future.
Where appropriate the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably.
Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international Groups similar to Regus and could result in signi cant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for.
Onerous lease provisions We have identi ed certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous, i. e. the Group does not expect to recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point.
The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate.
Dilapidations Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date of signing the lease.
The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date.
However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
Consequently provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an out ow will occur and can be reliably estimated.
