During the 2010 financial year, we strengthened our capital position while, involvement of at the same time, moving the organisation onto the front foot.
This is reflected in an improved year end performance driven by the strong growth in both assets under management and senior management customer deposits.
in monitoring risk A diversified portfolio of businesses enabled us to deliver a stable performance, as demonstrated by the growth in earnings of our Asset Management, Investment Banking, Capital Markets and liquidity and Property businesses.
Although the operating environment did improve over the period, the pace of economic recovery was slow.
This caused a delay in the improvement of nonperforming loans which negatively affected our Private Banking business.
Operating profit We have for the period increased 8.9% to 432.3 million.
The board recommended a final dividend of demonstrated the 8.0 pence per ordinary share, bringing total dividends per share for the year to 16.0 pence, up 23.1% from 13.0 pence in 2009. resilience of our business model Strengthened capital and liquidity and our ability to Throughout the financial crisis we have benefited from a stable balance sheet and the intimate maintain strategic involvement of senior management in monitoring risk and liquidity.
The group holds capital in excess of regulatory requirements and capital ratios are within our target range across momentum all core geographies.
Investec Limited was able to increase its capital adequacy ratio from 14.2% at the beginning of the financial year to 15.6% at the end of the period while Investec plc remained solid at 15.9% with our tier 1 target of 11% being exceeded in all geographies.
We will continue to protect the groups capital and liquidity position in a transformed capital environment.
Diversifying our funding sources has been a key element in improving the quality of the groups balance sheet and reducing our reliance on wholesale funding.
We have been successful in growing customer deposits in all three core geographies with an additional 7.3 billion customer deposits raised across the group.
The maintenance of cash reserves and a stock of readily available, high quality liquid assets well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements remains a core strategy.
Accordingly, we substantially increased our cash and near cash balances from 4.9 billion to 9.1 billion which, on average, was between 20% to 30% of our liability base over the period.
One of our strengths over the past two years has been our consistent ability to maintain low gearing ratios across the group.
This is represented by core loans and advances to equity at 5.4 times and total assets excluding assurance assets to equity at 12.5 times.
Distinctive specialist bank and asset manager The aim of our business model is to maintain an appropriate balance between revenue earned from operational risk businesses and revenue earned from financial risk businesses.
This ensures that we are not over reliant on any one part of the business to sustain our activities and that we have a large recurring revenue base that supports our long-term growth Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 18 objectives and helps us navigate through varying cycles.
Our current strategic objectives include increasing the proportion of our non-lending revenue base which we largely intend to achieve through the continued strengthening and development of our wealth and asset We will continue management businesses.
to protect the Accordingly, we have revised our mission statement to reflect this strategic intention.
Our mission is hence to be a distinctive specialist bank and asset manager, driven by commitment groups capital and to our core philosophies and values.
Against this background, we have modified our liquidity position in a segmental reporting disclosure for the period, effectively separating out the asset and wealth 2 management activities from the specialist banking activities.
transformed capital Asset Management environment Asset Management reported an increase in operating profit of 26.0% to 83.4 million, benefiting from substantial net inflows of 4.7 billion.
Since 31 March 2009, assets under management increased by 60.9% from 28.8 billion to 46.4 billion.
The divisions performance can be attributed to an experienced and stable team supported by a strong organisational culture and business structure.
We now have a wide distribution footprint and seven distinct, scalable investment capabilities.
We will continue our strategy of growing from the existing platform, reinforcing our position as an independent, pure play asset manager.
Private Wealth previously Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking Private Wealth reported an increase in operating profit of 7.4% to 25.9 million.
The business in South Africa was affected by lower activity levels.
The results of the UK operations include Investecs 47.1% share of the directors estimate of the post-tax profit of Rensburg Sheppards plc for the year ended 31 March 2010.
On 30 March 2010, we reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all share offer in which we will acquire the entire issued and to-be-issued ordinary share capital of Rensburg Sheppards plc not already owned by ourselves.
This provides a base for us to consolidate our wealth management businesses in the UK.
In South Africa, we are in the process of integrating the Private Banking wealth management business with the Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking business.
This will result in a global wealth management business with a clear strategy to offer an integrated service to our domestic and international clients which will have a total of 27 billion of funds under management.
Property Activities Property Activities generated an increase in operating profit of 35.6% to 33.5 million.
The results of the division were largely supported by continued enhancement of the investment property portfolio in South Africa.
Looking forward, efforts to launch additional funds are starting to gain traction in all three core geographies.
Private Banking The Private Banking division reported a weaker performance as a result of a sharp decline in activity levels and credit extension, and higher impairments.
Operating profit decreased by 54.0% to 37.0 million.
We focused on liquidity substantially increasing our product range and distribution capabilities resulting in our deposit book growing by 52.3% to 11.8 billion.
Funds under advice also increased 24.3% to 4.1 billion.
We have remained profitable throughout this difficult period, maintaining momentum and substantially increasing our client base.
This provides a solid foundation for future growth and we are now in a stronger competitive position to take advantage of identified opportunities.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 19 Operating Financial review continued Investment Banking The Investment Banking division reported an increase of 47.6% in operating profit to 41.6 million with mixed performances across geographies and business activity.
The Principal Investments division recorded a solid result, primarily driven by an improved performance from some of the investments held in the UK and Australian portfolios.
The Agency divisions closed fewer transactions in comparison with the prior year and commissions were affected by lower volumes.
While the outlook is predominantly driven by equity markets, our offering has expanded and we have grown the quality and size of our client base.
We will continue to invest in building the capacity and strength of our platforms seeking appropriate investment opportunities in support of our clients.
2 Capital Markets Capital Markets produced a solid performance with operating profit increasing 26.7% to 179.1 million.
The division has experienced reasonable but reduced levels of activity across the advisory businesses and took advantage of appropriate credit and trading opportunities.
Balance sheet management activities were affected by the lower rate environment and declining volatility.
Core loans and advances declined 6.1% to 4.5 billion.
Looking forward, we expect impairments to reduce and we remain well positioned in all key geographies to grow market share and extend our franchise.
Committed to high business ethics and to being a responsible lender In the past few years, the corporate environment has been marked by intense regulatory and public scrutiny, particularly in the financial services industry where there is increased pressure to improve the structure and practices of financial markets.
As an industry, we have much to do to regain the publics trust and to ensure the return of confidence to banking and finance.
At Investec, we are committed to high standards of corporate governance and business ethics in all our activities, which remains the cornerstone of our business.
Accordingly, throughout this year we have remained open for business and, at the same time, have reinforced our commitment to being a responsible lender, providing access to credit and support while maintaining sensible lending standards.
Our endeavours to pursue sustainable profits include having a positive impact in each of the societies in which our businesses operate.
Despite the difficult economic conditions of the past year, we continued to maintain our commitment to Our Business Responsibility as an integral part of how we do business.
As a result, we were recognised for our sustainability efforts, receiving a number of awards in this area.
In the UK, we received the Dragon Award 2009 for our Social Investment Programme.
In South Africa, we won the power fitness category of the Eskom Energy Efficiency Award 2009 which rewards exceptional effort in the efficient use of energy and recognises excellence in the communication of energy efficiency to employees.
Our Social Investment division won the 2009 Sunday Times Top 100 CSI Leadership Award in recognition of our overall societal approach and specifically the ongoing work within the educational arena.
The groups progress in this regard is outlined on pages 140 and 141 of this report.
Strong board of directors and dedicated staff delivering a distinctive service to clients In these challenging times where there are increasing corporate governance and regulatory demands, a strong board is essential to the effective management of the company.
During the period, we appointed Bradley Fried previously Chief Executive Officer of Investec Bank plc to the Investec plc and Investec Limited board as a non-executive director and look forward to the contribution his knowledge and wealth of experience brings to the board.
An essential element of our strategy and long-term success lies in our ability to deliver a distinctive service to our clients and relies on the continued support of our shareholders.
In doing this, we rely on the excellence, inspiration and dedication of our employees to serve our clients in a comprehensive manner.
For employees, the breadth of our businesses, entrepreneurial culture and a collaborative, performance-oriented work ethic offer a platform for individual success.
We continue to invest in the proficiency and future advancement of our talented employee base, and strive to provide for them an environment of genuine meritocracy.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 20 Focus remains on building our franchise Our current strategic objectives include increasing the proportion of our non-lending revenue base which we largely intend to achieve through the continued strengthening and development of our wealth and asset management businesses.
Key to this strategy is our ability to grow our revenue drivers by generating high quality income through diversified revenue streams.
We will also continue to focus on growing funds under management, increasing loan growth and transactional activity, and growing customer deposits.
In our endeavours to continue building the franchise, the following are key priorities for 2010: Maintaining a balanced portfolio of businesses 2 Continually aligning the business model Ensuring operational efficiency Serving clients with distinction Building and investing in the brand.
Well positioned to capitalise on opportunities The road ahead presents both challenges and opportunities.
The global economy remains fragile as sovereign risk becomes a key challenge and financial market activity is likely to remain uncertain for some time.
With our strong capital and liquidity position, we believe the foundations are now in place for further growth both in our non capital intensive asset management businesses as well as in our core specialist banking businesses.
Although the economic situation remains uncertain, we are well positioned not only to meet these challenges, but also to capture the opportunities that we believe will be available as the global financial markets continue to align to the new normal.

In terms of the contracts constituting the DLC structure, Investec plc and Investec Limited effectively form a single economic enterprise in which the economic and voting rights of ordinary shareholders of the companies are maintained in equilibrium relative to each other.
The directors of the two companies consider that for financial reporting purposes, the fairest presentation is achieved by combining the results and financial position of both companies.

Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 23 Financial and business review continued An overview of the operating environment impacting our business The global economy United Kingdom has shown some Official data shows the UK lagging other international economies in emerging from recession.
signs of recovery, After six consecutive falls in output, accounting for a drop of 6% of GDP, the economy expanded by 0.4% in Q4 2009 and 0.3% in Q1 2010.
The economy contracted by 3.7% however, operating 2 in the 2009 2010 financial year.
While Q1 2010 looks adversely affected by heavy snowfall, fundamentals remain independent surveys point to a faster pace of expansion than officially recorded, suggesting that economic recovery may have started earlier in the UK.
The course of this year has mixed with activity seen some encouraging developments: unemployment started to fall sooner than we had hoped and deterioration in public finances was less than government had forecast: both levels below historic developments point to stronger economic activity.
trends Yet the public deficit still hit a hefty 11.1% of GDP and it became a central election issue.
The MPC extended its process of quantitative easing across the financial year creating money in exchange for mainly government bonds from a proposed 75 billion in March 2009 to 200 billion, purchases that it completed in January 2010.
Since then the committee has become increasingly fretful of a more persistent rate of CPI inflation, which stood at 3.4% at the end of 2009 2010.
Eurozone The Eurozone economy emerged from recession in Q3 2009, expanding by 0.4% in Q3, but posting softer growth in subsequent quarters.
The larger economies of Germany and France led this expansion, posting growth of 0.4% and 0.3% respectively in Q2, both benefiting from international car scrappage schemes and Germany particularly lifted by a revival in world trade and exports to the Far East and China specifically.
Growth softened to 0.1% in Q4 and 0.2% in Q1 2010, although survey evidence has suggested a quickening of growth thereafter.
Yet the Eurozone has become embroiled in a government debt crisis that began in October when the new Greek government revealed significant discrepancies in its national accounts, making it the Eurozones most indebted nation.
Greek financing costs rose gradually from here, but the increase accelerated in 2010.
A bungled bail-out proposal, impeded by a German government facing a key election, added to market uncertainty and while Greek debt costs soared towards the financial year end there were some signs of worries spilling into other Eurozone economies including Portugal, Ireland and Spain.
The European Central Bank, which had been slower to react to economic slowdown than other international central banks, started this financial year still cutting its key refinancing rate to 1.00%.
It then announced a series of technical measures in April 2009 that drove overnight interest rates to hover around 0.35% from July 2009 to the end of March 2010.
Australia The Australian economy rebounded from just one quarters contraction in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse, but has expanded consistently since then, posting an average quarterly growth rate of 0.7% across 2009 2010 to see annual GDP 1.8% higher.
Yet this still sub-trend pace of expansion coincided with a rise in unemployment, which reached a peak of 5.8% in Q3 2009, before easing back to 5.4% by the years close.
The economy benefited from the recovery in Asian markets and exports provided a lift to the economy in the first half of 2009.
However, this year has seen momentum spread into domestic demand, with Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 24 household spending posting solid increases.
The Reserve Bank of Australia RBA was still easing monetary policy at the start of the financial year and cut its key cash rate to 3.0% in April 2009.
Yet the spread of recovery into the domestic economy led the RBA to withdraw some of this stimulus and rates began to rise in August 2009, taking rates to 4.0% by year end.
United States The US economy started expanding again this year.
Q2 2009 posted the fourth consecutive quarterly contraction, reducing GDP by 3.8% from its peak.
Q3 saw the economy begin to grow again, expanding by 2.2% annualised.
This was followed by increases of 5.6% and 3.0% in the subsequent quarters, although these figures were boosted by the inventory cycle and growth averaged just 1.3% per quarter excluding 2 this effect.
The arbiter of the US economic cycle, the National Bureau of Economic Research, is yet to declare an end to the recession, but the quarterly pattern of growth suggests that this has indeed happened.
The economic downturn also led to a disproportionately aggressive labour market response, with dramatically reduced headcount.
This boosted labour productivity, which should bode well for employment trends ahead.
Indeed payrolls started to rise again towards the end of the period under review.
But pay growth remains subdued and is contributing to a still softening rate of core inflation.
The Federal Reserve remains cautious over the economic outlook, and closed all but one of its special operations to support financial markets as conditions improved during 2009 2010.
It also completed its credit easing purchases.
The Federal Reserve maintained its commitment to leave rates exceptionally low for an extended period although, since the start of 2010, one member has moved to drop this commitment.
Overall the Fed now oversees an economy with a modest growth outlook, not one facing another depression.
South Africa South Africas general elections took place in April 2009, with the ANC retaining majority but resulting in a switch in leaders from acting President Kgalema Motlhanthe to South Africas current leader, President Jacob Zuma.
Despite unfounded fears that the leader of the ANC would alter economic policies once he gained the presidency, President Zuma proved not only to steer a steady course, but has soothed many opposing sectors while simultaneously providing both policy continuity and improved workings of monetary and fiscal operations.
Draft work on current policies, from industrial to education, is aimed at setting South Africa on a higher growth and employment path, one which is achievable given the relatively robust way the country has weathered the international credit crisis.
While South Africa did slip into recession at the end of 2008, which bottomed in the first quarter of 2009, the contraction only lasted three quarters.
With quarterly growth of 0.8% at the end of 2009, South Africa is expected to see an improved growth outcome this year, with 2010 averaging 2.7%, and the 2011 forecast running at 3.6%.
In addition, the expectation of a fiscal deficit of 7.3% of GDP for 2009 2010 has been revised to 6.8% of GDP, due to improved revenue collection and subdued expenditure.
The fiscal deficit was expected at 6.2% for 2010 2011 but this is likely to be revised closer to 5% as the economy grows at a faster pace than Treasury expected.
Key is that South Africa itself did not experience a banking crisis due to the well regulated nature of the industry, aided by exchange controls and substantial bank supervision, which prevented any contagion.
Instead, South Africa was afflicted by the fact that the international credit crises morphed into a global recession, decimating export markets and causing 8% of the workforce to become unemployed.
The institution of the NCA National Credit Act mid 2008 limited consumer indebtedness at the peak of the boom, but did not prevent the private sector from reaching a heady household debt to disposable income ratio of 80% in 2009, well up from 60% in 2005.
The previous cumulative 5% hike in interest rates, beginning mid 2006, had little impact on the build up in debt, but coincided with the global economic slowdown, leading to five successive quarters of contraction in household consumption, beginning in the third quarter of 2008.
Interest rates were then cut by 5.5% since December 2008, with 3% in the past financial year.
In early 2010, consumer spending showed signs of fragile recovery.
CPI inflation continued on its downward path throughout 2009, ending the financial year at 5.1% year-on-year.
Key to the easing in inflation has been Rand strength over most of 2009 and 2010, in particular against the Euro, supported by capital inflows into domestic bonds and equities on the back of a re-rating in sovereign risk, and still relatively high South African interest rates.
Rand strength was broad based across all major currencies but most pronounced against the Dollar and the Euro.

Other operating income loss The consolidation of the operating results of certain investments held within our Private Equity portfolio is partly reflected in other operating income loss, which improved from a loss of 30.2 million to a gain of 22.7 million.
Impairment losses on loans and advances The weaker credit cycle has caused a decline in the performance of our loan portfolio.
Impairment losses on loans and advances have increased from 163.0 million to 205.4 million excluding Kensington.
The credit loss charge as a percentage of average gross core loans and advances is 1.16%, marginally higher than the 1.08% reported at 31 March 2009.

Total expenses grew by 14.9% to 957.2 million 2009: 833.3 million largely as a result of the appreciation of the Rand and an increase in variable remuneration in certain divisions given improved profitability.
Total staff compensation costs increased by 15.0% to 598.1 million 2009: 520.2 million, resulting in a compensation ratio of 36.1% 2009: 34.9%.

client delivery with international access Principal Investments Southern Africa The Direct Investments portfolio decreased to R1 587 million at 31 March 2010 March 2009: R1 816 million.
The decrease in value was primarily due to realisations on listed equities The Private Equity portfolio was R3 301 million at 31 March 2010 March 2009: R2 525 million.
We continued to expand the capacity of our private equity investments through the acquisition of two new private equity assets, two bolt-on acquisitions within the portfolio and large capital projects and expenditure.
The benefits of these activities will only be felt in future financial years.
The increase in value in the current year was driven by a good performance of the underlying investments and acquisitions mentioned.
Australia The total size of the Private Equity funds is A$460 million Private Equity completed the successful divestment of one of its portfolio companies generating a substantial profit The investment portfolio continues to perform satisfactorily and is well placed to capitalise on the recovery in both global and local economies In the second half of the financial year the Private Equity business took a more proactive approach in identifying and evaluating new investment opportunities as the economic outlook and confidence generally continued to improve.

We are seeing increased competition in M&A as established banks and new boutiques move into this area of the market.
While the outlook for M&A seems to have improved slightly over the last 12 months, continuing economic uncertainty suggests M&A and capital markets will recover slowly.

products, services and solutions to Australia 2 While activity in the resources sector was initially quiet, the rapid recovery of the equity select corporate and commodity markets, as well as our refocused marketing to mid-tier and larger mining clients, public companies, resulted in increased deal flow during the year for our Commodities and Resource Finance business sector bodies and A strong performance in our project advisory, debt arranging and principal lending activities was driven by improved market conditions, cross-border deals and some institutions.
We significant advisory and arranging mandates, notably the debt financing of the Collgar undertake the bulk of Wind Farm.
In parallel, our wind farm development business finalised the sale of Collgar to institutional investors Investecs wholesale This was a year of consolidation for the Structured Finance business with emphasis on debt, structuring, improved operational capability for the Investec Global Aircraft Fund IGAF coupled with the additional capital raising of A$45 million proprietary trading, Ongoing management of the legacy book was a key priority for the Principal Finance capital markets and business, but this was coupled with strong deal flow and revenue generation from new lending in the media and entertainment sectors as well as credit trading in both derivatives business structured credit and corporate debt Wholesale capital raising under the Australian Government Guarantee Scheme continued successfully, albeit at the higher margins prevailing in the post global financial crisis market.
The resultant liquidity was actively invested in high quality liquid assets and other appropriate securities and this generated strong returns The trading desk performed well despite operating within very narrow risk limits and it benefited from favourable positioning in the interest rate and foreign exchange markets.
Outlook We are a focused business targeting markets where we can be distinctive and competitive We remain committed to building a sustainable business franchise with diversified revenue streams in our core geographies In the UK and Southern Africa we will continue to strive for depth and greater penetration.
In Australia we continue to look for opportunities to broaden our franchise The current negative cycle is the time to shape the business for the future and to position ourselves for growth in a changed competitive landscape This stage of the cycle is likely to see continuing defaults but impairments and losses will be lower Looking at the environment in our core geographies: In South Africa the impact of the global recession is being felt.
We are generally well positioned in this market with a reasonably robust credit portfolio.
The effects of the recession have lead to reduced activity in the structuring and lending businesses and trading volumes are down.
Reduced activity is to some extent offset by wider margins and the landscape for PFI has improved Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 48 In the UK the environment remains weak but is starting to recover.
The changed competitive landscape is allowing us to win clients.
Overall we continue to be reasonably well positioned and activity is starting to increase In Australia the environment is improving and we are seeing an increase in business flows.
Whilst the corporate credit environment remains a concern, overall we are positioning ourselves for growth The environment has changed but so too has the competitive landscape.
A large amount of capacity has been removed from the market and the number of players in our core geographies has reduced substantially.
This plays to our strengths of being a specialist and bespoke service provider.
In the short term we expect conditions to remain challenging: however, we believe that in the medium term this is an excellent opportunity to grow market share and deepen our franchise.
2 UK and Europe We look forward to executing our first securitisations during the year as the asset backed securitisation market reopens.
We have commenced modest new loan origination in Kensington in the prime product range Liquidity is no longer a constraint although the cost of raising and carrying surplus liquidity is causing a negative impact on net interest income.
We have very little reliance on the wholesale markets The UK market is showing signs of growth once more and we are well positioned to take advantage of this upturn in the market The outlook on bad debts is substantially lower than at the same time last year The corporate market has opened itself to new relationships and we are taking advantage of the opportunity.
Southern Africa The division is well positioned for any potential upturn in the general economy, although we do not expect this until the second half of the financial year The overall credit portfolio is robust with higher margins Volumes and activity in the financial markets remain subdued and therefore trading and structuring opportunities are expected to remain at lower levels for at least the first half of the next financial year We anticipate growing both our credit portfolio and investment product retail offerings which will increase the level of annuity based income We anticipate that we will continue to be a net provider of liquidity to the interbank market and plan to increase the average duration of our wholesale funding base.
Australia In resources, we continue to build a pipeline of deals focused on mid-tier and larger mining companies with one or more assets in production, where the risk and return profile remains attractive In aviation, we intend to work closely with Investecs aviation finance teams in London and Johannesburg to pursue aircraft leasing transactions and, in parallel, create investment opportunities for the additional capital that has been raised for the IGAF In renewable energy, we continue to work on a fleet of development assets in a range of technologies and will seek to exit some of these during the course of the year.
In parallel our project advisory, debt arranging and principal lending business is expected to remain active based on current deal pipeline and market conditions Our newly established Corporate Debt business, which targets event driven borrowing by mid-tier and larger corporates, has already achieved some success in the domestic market and we expect to see strong deal flow in this business In our Principal Finance team, we continue to seek opportunities in the structured credit market, whether as short-term credit trading strategies or as longer term holds of quality assets at margins which remain attractive notwithstanding the compression that has already occurred Treasury will focus on ongoing balance sheet management priorities particularly optimising our strong liquidity position and, more urgently, will be growing our sales and structuring activities Our trading business remains one with modest market risk and, as our sales activities generate additional customer flow, we will look to broaden this business in order to meet the requirements of these clients.

However, capital 2 a portion thereof 59.6 million is allocated to the operating divisions for purposes of determining return on adjusted capital per business segment.
Central costs are higher than the prior year mainly due to the appreciation of the Rand against Pounds Sterling.

Geographic summary of the year in review from a risk perspective Detailed information on key developments during the financial year in review is provided in the sections that follow refer to pages 59 and 60, page 75 and pages 83 and 84, with a high level geographic summary of the most salient aspects provided below.
UK and Europe Credit risk: The year in review remained challenging as weak economic conditions continued to impact on clients activities and underlying asset values.
An increase in defaults largely reflects the continued poor performances of our Irish portfolios.
Key focus areas have been on proactive loan book management, repositioning some of our portfolio asset mixes as well as taking advantage of opportunities that have arisen as a result of dislocated markets.
Traded market risk: The trading desks performed well, benefiting from increased customer flow and new product launches.
Balance sheet risk: The economy benefitted from the return of liquidity and the resultant fall in liquidity and credit spreads which were only marginally above pre-2007 crisis levels.
Cash markets have seen a similar return of risk appetite, with banks and corporates being able to access capital markets at increasingly attractive levels.
Retail customer deposit demand for Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 55 Risk management continued Investec products has been strong and we continued to significantly enhance our cash and near cash balances.
Cash and near cash balances South Africa up 87.4% to Credit risk: The impact of lower average interest rates has yet to make a significant mark on key credit and arrear indicators.
The credit quality of our core loans and advances deteriorated 9.1 billion throughout the year under review resulting in an increase in our Private Banking impairments raised.
There has, however, been a slow down in the number of default loans in the second half of the financial year and impairments appear to have peaked.
Traded market risk: Markets have been relatively difficult to gauge over the past year resulting in a significant decline in client flow and trading activity.
Customer deposits 3 Balance sheet risk: The interest rate environment was stable and relatively uneventful during up 50.5% to the financial year.
The cost of term deposits, however, rose steadily throughout 2009 which placed interest rate margins under pressure.
This was compensated for by higher yields 21.9 billion earned on liquid and trading assets.
The Private Bank aggressively grew its deposit book and moderated its asset base resulting in a substantial increase in surplus cash reserves which we placed largely in higher yielding treasury bills.
Our liquidity position was further boosted by several successful medium term senior and subordinated notes issues totaling over R4 billion.
Cash and near cash balances increased significantly over the period.
Advances as a % Australia of customer deposits: Credit risk: The credit environment remains challenging and the credit quality of our loan portfolio continued to deteriorate.
We have continued to reposition our asset mix and have 76.2% been successful in selectively growing our loan book within the professional finance business, which targets members of the medical and accounting professions.
Traded market risk: Trading activity remains modest, with the focus being mainly commodity hedging.
Balance sheet risk: The combination of a rapid easing of monetary policy, stimulatory fiscal policy along with only muted impacts of the global financial crisis on China and some of Australias other Asian trading partners has seen a resilience in the Australian economy.
The availability of liquidity has thus remained relatively strong.
Against this backdrop, we continued to diversify the mix of our funds across distribution channels and increase client numbers.
We maintained a strong liquidity position well in excess of regulatory and internal policy requirements throughout the year.

Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 57 Risk management continued An overview of key risks In our ordinary course of business we face a number of risks that could affect our business operations.
These risks are highlighted below: Credit and counterparty risk exposes us to losses caused by financial or other problems experienced by our clients Liquidity risk may impair our ability to fund our operations Our net interest earnings and net asset value may be adversely affected by interest rate risk Market, business and general economic conditions and fluctuations could adversely affect our businesses in a number of ways We may be unable to recruit, retain and motivate key personnel Employee misconduct could cause harm that is difficult to detect Operational risk may disrupt our business or result in regulatory action We are exposed to non-traded currency risk, where fluctuations in exchange rates against Pounds Sterling, could have an impact on our 3 financial results We may be vulnerable to the failure of our systems and breaches of our security systems We may have insufficient capital in the future and may be unable to secure additional financing when it is required The financial services industry in which we operate is intensely competitive Legal and regulatory risks are substantial in our businesses Reputational, strategic and business risk We may be exposed to pension risk in our UK operations.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may in the future also impair our business operations.
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of these risk factors.
Risk management framework, committees and forums A number of committees and forums identify and manage risk at both a business unit level in various locations and at a group level, as described more fully below.
These committees and forums operate together with group Risk Management and are mandated by the board.
A diagram of our governance and risk framework is provided on page 100.
This section provides an overview of risks and related developments that occurred during the year under review.
Further detail on our risk management framework, committees and forums as well as our risk management and measurement techniques can be found in the Investec groups 2010 annual report.
In the sections that follow the following abbreviations are used on numerous occasions: BRCC Board Risk and Capital Committee ERRF Executive Risk Review Forum FSA Financial Services Authority SARB South African Reserve Bank APRA Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority Credit and counterparty risk management Credit and counterparty risk description Credit and counterparty risk is defined as the current and prospective risk to earnings or capital arising from an obligors typically a clients or counterpartys failure to meet the terms of any obligation to us or otherwise to perform as agreed.
Credit and counterparty risk arises when funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether reflected on or off balance sheet.
Credit and counterparty risk arises primarily from three types of transactions: Lending transactions, giving rise to a direct exposure.
The risk is created that an obligor will be unable or unwilling to repay capital and or interest on advances and loans granted to it.
This category includes bank placements, where we have placed funds with other financial institutions Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 58 Issuer risk on financial instruments where payments due from the issuer of a financial instrument will not be received Trading transactions, giving rise to settlement and replacement risk collectively counterparty risk Settlement risk is the risk that the settlement of a transaction does not take place as expected, with one party effecting required settlements as they fall due but not receiving settlements to which they are entitled Replacement risk is the risk following default by the original counterparty resulting in the contract holder having to enter into a replacement contract with a second counterparty in order to finalise the transaction.
Credit and counterparty risk can manifest as country risk as a result of the geopolitical and transfer risk associated with exposures arising from transactions with borrowers who are resident in a particular foreign country, or dependent on that countrys economy.
Credit and counterparty risk may also arise in other ways and it is the role of the various independent credit committees, assisted by Credit Risk Management, to identify situations falling outside these definitions where credit risk may also be present.
3 Credit and counterparty risk year in review UK and Europe The year in review remained challenging as the severe deterioration in economic conditions globally continued to impact on clients activities and underlying asset values.
Increased vigilance on monitoring the existing loan portfolios coupled with early identification of clients experiencing difficulty resulted in fewer counterparties being forced to exit positions into illiquid markets with falling asset values.
Risk officers working closely with clients and business units moderated large increases in impairments and defaults.
Whilst impairments and defaults have risen during the financial year under review the various portfolios across the business units have proven to be resilient.
The Irish market was particularly affected by economic difficulties and the local banking crisis.
The fall in property asset values is as reflected in our gross default figures and increased impairments in that geography.
Given that market conditions have affected property market asset values we have curtailed our appetite for lending secured by property assets and have taken the opportunity to rebalance our portfolios with other asset classes.
Where we are presented with the opportunity to consider new transactions secured by property we will continue to assess the merits of the transaction and balance the risk against the reward of assuming additional exposure in this regard.
Lending supported by proven cash flow rather than asset value propositions continues to be favoured.
Core loans and advances contracted by 8.8% to 5.4 billion, primarily as a result of a cautious approach in accepting new loan exposures and a conscious effort to rebalance our existing portfolio mix.
Defaulted loans net of impairments have decreased from 3.51% to 3.16% of core loans and advances.
The first quarter of 2010 appeared to reflect an improving economic environment as arrears, default and impairment figures tapered off and deteriorating asset quality slowed down in the final quarter.
The credit loss ratio has increased from 1.46% to 1.72%, in line with guidance previously provided.
All accounts continue to be proactively managed and customers have demonstrated their ability to service loans where assets originally intended for sale have been held for longer than originally expected as a result of illiquid market conditions and cautious buyers of assets.
The relatively low interest rate environment continues to favour leveraged clients with access to cash flow to meet debt servicing needs.
The performance of all accounts is regularly reviewed by the independent credit function and impairments taken as necessary.
Within our Capital Markets division we have experienced increased defaults and associated write offs in our Acquisition Finance.
Counterparties in the automotive, construction and leisure sectors in particular continued to experience cash flow pressures.
Our exposures within this business unit are all senior secured facilities.
We expect further difficulty to be experienced in this book over the next financial year, however, at a subdued level of stress.
The level of impairments slowed in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and no impairments were raised against these assets in the first quarter of 2010.
In keeping with our desire to continue sourcing better quality assets and to reposition some of our portfolios we have realigned our focus in the resource finance sector.
Our intent is to attract existing, producing assets with proven reserves, good production track record and technically competent management teams in jurisdictions that we are comfortable to operate in.
The resource finance exposure increased year-on-year reflecting our desire to accumulate good quality assets in this area.
Exposure to resource finance transactions accounts for 1.2% of core loans and advances as at 31 March 2010.
We remained cautious with respect to lending in the Private Banking division with activity levels remaining low in the first half of the financial year and only increasing in the first quarter of 2010.
We continue to work with customers who have experienced financial difficulty to arrive at an optimal solution for the client and the bank, which for example has included applying for change of use for certain property related transactions and extensions of time for properties that have continued to service their debt obligations.
Where private clients have supported a transaction by way of personal guarantees, and the original exit was through the sale of assets and such sale would severely diminish the profitability of a project, in the ordinary course of business we have considered extensions to the term of the original transaction to assess market conditions and achieve an orderly exit.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 59 Risk management continued The Kensington mortgage book continues to perform to expectations.
Defaults and past due loans reached a plateau in the second and third quarter of 2009 and began to improve in the first quarter of 2010.
Repossessions have reduced substantially with a 60% decline in the number of accounts subject to repossession from March 2009 to March 2010.
The group Risk division has continued to work closely with the business units to manage the increased market risks and resultant pressure on our lending portfolios.
The key focus of the group Risk division has been on proactive book management together with the business units, repositioning some of our portfolios asset mixes as well as taking advantage of opportunities that have arisen as a result of dislocated markets.
Southern Africa The financial year in review has seen a combination of trends and factors impacting on the credit quality and assessment of credit and counterparty risk: The impact of the global financial crisis on the current domestic economic cycle Continuation of a conservative lending approach with some relaxation towards the end of the first quarter of 2010 3 Reduced discretionary spending, even in a lower interest rate environment Early signs of the domestic economy emerging out of recession in first quarter of 2010 Increased interbank activity reflecting the reversal of the previous years liquidity constraints Strong appreciation in the value of the Rand against major trading currencies, with the largest appreciation against the US Dollar Market volatility continued with the JSE reflecting growth of 41% year on year, albeit coming off a low base The property market remains under pressure with low or static growth across the residential and commercial property markets.
We are conscious of the effect of the slowdown of growth in the property market both global and local and the impact on our portfolio secured by property.
The high net worth and or stable income streams of our target market clients provides a level of protection from decreases in property values.
Over the past few years as property values increased, many clients built an effective equity buffer, resulting in lower average loan to value ratios which have reduced potential losses on depreciation of values.
As at 31 March 2010 the average loan to value ratio within the property development portfolio stood at 69% based on net sell out values.
Lower levels of volatility relative to the 2009 financial year have resulted in lower profitability levels and exposure for the majority of our trading divisions.
For both interest rate and foreign exchange rate products simulation methodologies are employed which enable us to identify more accurately the level of potential exposures to counterparties for these trading activities.
The methodologies recognise volume of trading, volatility of products traded, deal tenor and credit mitigants in deriving granular counterparty exposure profiles and, in so doing, allow for roll-off risk assessments.
Loans and advances secured by share portfolios including BEE transactions are monitored frequently.
Most of these counterparties remain within credit approved loan to value or cover ratios and are performing on current debt obligations.
For assets written during the current year there has been strict adherence to lower loan to value lending and increased pricing requirements although there has been some downward pricing pressures towards the end of the first quarter of 2010. Credit quality on gross core loans and advances deteriorated throughout the year under review, with the majority of impairments raised in the Private Bank division, distributed between the residential and commercial property portfolios.
These defaults largely comprise a relatively small number of clients where finance was provided at reasonably conservative loan to values but with no obvious serviceability except realisation of collateral.
Defaults have occurred when clients have been unable to realise sales to service and repay.
There has, however, been a slowdown in the number of default loans in the second half of the financial year.
Investec Capital Markets reported no material defaults for the current financial year.
Core loans and advances decreased by 1.9% to R118.2 billion.
Default loans net of impairments as a percentage of core loans and advances increased from 2.12% to 3.32%.
The credit loss ratio has increased from 0.67% to 0.71% in line with guidance previously provided.
A lot of emphasis has been placed on the strengthening of recoveries and administrative areas and increased involvement from executive and senior management to deal with potential problematic loans and working on the best outcome solution for our clients and ourselves.
Australia During the year core loans and advances to customers increased by 3.4% to A$3.0 billion, predominantly through selective growth within the professional finance business unit: which provides finance to targeted members of the medical and accounting professions.
This has resulted in a continued shift in portfolio mix away from lending secured by property towards other asset classes.
There has been deterioration in credit quality throughout the year under review.
Defaults net of impairments have risen to 10.26% of core loans and advances and the credit loss ratio has decreased from 1.74% to 1.67%.
A continued focus on asset quality remains fundamental to our approach to the credit environment, which is likely to remain challenging for some time.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 60 Credit and counterparty risk information An analysis of gross credit and counterparty exposures Credit and counterparty exposures increased by 25.1% to 36.4 billion largely as a result of the appreciation of the Rand and Australian Dollar against Pounds Sterling, as well as the significant increase in cash and near cash balances over the period.
Cash and near cash balances increased by 87.4% to 9.1 billion and are largely reflected in the following line items in the table below: debt instruments: bank placements: sovereign, government placements.

The remainder of core loans and advances largely reside within our Capital Markets division and are evenly spread across industry sectors.
Other credit and counterparty exposures are largely reflective of cash and near cash balances held with institutions and central banks, thus the large balance reflected in the public and non-business services and finance and insurance sectors.
These exposures also include offbalance sheet items such as guarantees, committed facilities and contingent liabilities, largely to our HNW and professional individual Private Banking clients.

The market risk management team identifies, quantifies and manages the effects of these potential changes in accordance with Basel ll and policies determined by the board.
Within our trading activities, we act as principal with clients or the market.
Market risk, therefore, exists where we have taken on principal positions, resulting from proprietary trading, market making, arbitrage, underwriting and investments in the commodity, foreign exchange, equity, capital and money markets.
The focus of these businesses is primarily on supporting client activity.
Our strategic intent is that proprietary trading should be limited and that trading should be conducted largely to facilitate clients in deal execution.
This arises from the consolidation offset between various asset classes.

As a result the trading desks have reduced the amount of proprietary trading risk that they have been willing to accept and have concentrated on managing existing risks.
Market risk limit utilisation by the trading desks has been relatively low throughout the year, which is evident in a decrease in the VaR numbers.
Despite the difficult trading conditions all trading desks recorded a profit.
In the UK the Structured Equity desk has continued to experience strong growth in their retail product sales and they continue to expand their product range.
The Interest Rate and Forex desks have also performed well benefiting from both increased volatility and flows.
The Fixed Income desk was closed during the course of the year.
Australian trading activity remains modest, with the focus being mainly commodity hedging.
As mentioned above the majority of revenue earned from our trading activities within the Capital Markets division is related to client flow activity.

We maintained The table will not agree directly to the balances disclosed in the balance sheet since the table incorporates cash flows on a contractual, undiscounted basis based on the earliest date on a strong liquidity which the group can be required to pay.
profile throughout We maintained a strong liquidity profile throughout the year.
Our limited reliance on the year securitisations as a source of funding has meant that the uncertainty in securitisation markets has not impacted our liquidity risk profile.
Despite competitive pressures we were able to increase deposits taken from the retail market and raise additional liquidity.
The tables reflect that loans and advances to customers are largely financed by stable funding sources.
3 With respect to the contractual liquidity mismatch: No assumptions are made, and we record all asset and liabilities with the underlying contractual maturity as determined by the cash flow profile for each deal As an integral part of the broader liquidity generation strategy, we maintain a liquidity buffer in the form of unencumbered, cash, government, or bank paper typically eligible for repurchase with the central bank, and near cash as a buffer against both expected and unexpected cash flows The actual contractual profile of this asset class is of little consequence, as practically Investec would meet any unexpected net cash outflows by selling these securities, we have: Set the time horizon to one month to monetise our cash and near cash portfolio of available for sale discretionary treasury assets, where there are deep secondary markets for this elective asset class Set the time horizon to on demand to monetise our statutory liquid assets for which liquidity is guaranteed by the central bank Reported the contractual profile by way of a note to the tables.
With respect to the behavioural liquidity mismatch: The new funding we would require under normal business circumstances is shown in the behavioural mismatch.
To this end, behavioural profiling is applied to liabilities with an indeterminable maturity, as the contractual repayments of many customer accounts are on demand or at short notice but expected cash flows vary significantly from contractual maturity.
An internal analysis model is used, based on statistical research of the historical series of products, which models the point of probable maturity.
In addition, re-investment behaviour, with profile and attrition based on history, is applied to term deposits in the normal course of business.

Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 82 Balance sheet risk year in review UK and Europe A consistent theme is the return of liquidity and the resultant fall in liquidity and credit spreads.
The spread between 3-month SONIA and 3- month Libor, a straightforward measure of the liquidity premium, fell from 162.5bp to its current level of 17bp, only a few basis points above where this same measure was prior to the 2007 crisis.
Retail demand for Investec products has been strong with net retail deposit growth for the year of 3.6 billion.
Of this total, the Private Bank raised a total of 2.2 billion and term retail funding, via structured equity deposits within the Capital Markets division, raised 800 million with a weighted average expected term of 3.4 years.
In addition, strong inroads into the SME corporate market has resulted in corporate deposits increasing by 600 million over the year.
Total customer deposits increased by 83.4% from 1 April 2009 to 8.0 billion at 31 March 2010 comprising Private Bank deposits of 6.3 billion, structured equity deposits of 836 million and corporate deposits of 763 million.
Cash and near cash balances more than doubled from 1 April 2009 to 3.7 billion at 31 March 2010.
The challenge for the year ahead will be to curtail the strong inflow of deposits and manage the resultant surplus 3 liquidity without damaging the franchises that have been built up so successfully.
South Africa In contrast to the prior year the South African interest rate environment was stable and relatively uneventful.
This was compensated by higher yields earned on liquid and trading assets.
The gap between treasury bill and deposit yields shrank to almost zero over the year largely due to increased borrowing requirements from the government.
Liquidity conditions stabilised and improved over the financial year.
Our liquidity was further boosted by several successful medium term senior and subordinated notes issues totaling over R4 billion.
The cost of these issues varied between 150bp and 200bp over Jibar.
Total customer deposits increased by 12.8% from 1 April 2009 to R143.1 billion at 31 March 2010 Private Bank deposits amount to R51.2 billion and other retail deposits amount to R91.9 billion.
Cash and near cash balances increased by 46.7% from 1 April 2009 to R48.0 billion at 31 March 2010.
The prospect of regulatory change will continue to force us and other banks to lengthen our deposit books, reprice new assets upwards and reduce our rate of asset growth.
Australia In Australia the economy has seen a resilience related to, stimulatory fiscal policy along with only muted impacts of the global financial crisis on China and some of Australias other Asian trading partners, and consequently, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates in the second half of the year.
Consistent with the stabilisation of the international environment and the actions of other governments internationally the Australian Federal Government announced the closing of its Government Guarantee Scheme for wholesale funding effective 31 March 2010.
During this period, Investec Australia utilised the stronger availability of funding to lengthen the term profile of its wholesale funding and to reshape the mix of its Private Bank funding base by significantly increasing the diversified mix of funds across distribution channels and increasing client numbers while reducing the average size of deposits taken.
Investec Australia maintained a strong liquidity position well in excess of regulatory and internal policy requirements throughout the year, with cash and near cash balances increasing to A$1.8 billion at 31 March 2010.
Total customer deposits increased through the year with Private Bank deposits increasing to A$1.4 billion by 31 March 2010.
Investec group We successfully embarked on several term debt funding initiatives.
This allowed us to maintain liquidity above internal and external liquidity targets.
Decisions concerning timing of issuance and the tenor of liabilities are based upon relative costs, general market conditions, prospective views of organic balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile.

Operational risk management Operational risk description Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss or earnings volatility arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.
We recognise operational risk as a significant risk category, and strive to manage this within acceptable levels through the promotion of appropriate and relevant sound operational risk management practices.
We have adopted The Standardised Approach to calculate the regulatory operational risk capital requirement.
Developments Supervisory interaction During the year, the group was subject to regulatory onsite reviews by the SARB, the FSA and APRA.
We have actively participated in the FSAs Raising the Bar discussion groups.
Regular engagement with industry groups and fora enables the group to be informed of developments and thus advance operational risk management practices.
Areas of focus include: Embedding more sophisticated operational risk practices within the group Business continuity capability: rigorous and ongoing simulations and readiness evaluation.
The impact of the Soccer World Cup in South Africa has been considered and appropriate actions taken to mitigate the potential risks Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 84 Financial crime: initiatives to improve understanding, awareness and internal processes are in place to minimise losses and recover assets and, where appropriate, to report suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities.
Developments in this area are monitored through participation in the industry fora Privacy and confidentiality: ongoing focus on ensuring the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our information by identifying and reducing the risks to our information assets and systems Continued attention to practices and controls relating to execution, delivery and process risks.
Embedding operational risk management practices in the group remains an ongoing activity.
The framework and practices are continuously monitored and developed to ensure that they remain relevant, appropriate, adequate and in line with leading industry practices and regulatory requirements.
Reputational risk 3 Reputational risk is damage to our reputation, name or brand.
Reputational risk arises as a result of other risks manifesting and not being mitigated.
We have various policies and practices to mitigate reputational risk, including strong values that are regularly and proactively reinforced.
We also subscribe to sound corporate governance practices, which require that activities, processes and decisions are based on carefully considered principles.
We are aware of the impact of practices that may result in a breakdown of trust and confidence in the organisation.
The groups policies and practices are regularly reinforced through transparent communication, accurate reporting, continuous group culture and values assessment, internal audit and regulatory compliance review, and risk management practices.
Pension risk Pension risk arises from defined benefit schemes, where Investec plc is required to fund any deficit in the schemes.
There are two defined benefit schemes within Investec plc and both are closed to new business.
Pension risk arises if the net present value of future cash outflows is greater than the current value of the asset pool set aside to cover those payments.
Primary causes of any deficit include: A mismatch in the duration of the assets relative to the liabilities Market driven asset price volatility Increased life expectancy of individuals leading to increased liabilities.
Investec plc monitors the position of the funds closely, regularly assessing potential adverse movements in the schemes.
Legal risk management Legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from any of our rights not being fully enforceable or from our obligations not being properly performed.
This includes our rights and obligations under contracts entered into with counterparties.
Such risk is especially applicable where the counterparty defaults and the relevant documentation may not give rise to the rights and remedies anticipated when the transaction was entered.
Our objective is to identify, manage, monitor and mitigate legal risks throughout the group.
We seek to actively mitigate these risks by identifying them, setting minimum standards for their management and allocating clear responsibility for such management to legal risk managers, as well as ensuring compliance through proactive monitoring.
The scope of our activities is continuously reviewed and includes the following areas: Relationship contracts Legislation governance Litigation Corporate events Incident or crisis management Ongoing quality control.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 85 Risk management continued Capital management and allocation Although Investec plc and its subsidiaries and Investec Limited and its subsidiaries are managed independently, the approach to capital management is consistent across the two groups.
The DLC structure requires the two groups to be considered independent from a capital perspective and hence capital is managed on this basis.
This approach is exercised through the BRCC via the Investec DLC Capital Committee which is a board sub-committee with ultimate responsibility for the capital sufficiency of both Investec plc and Investec Limited.
The legal and regulatory treatment of capital is independent of existing shareholder arrangements that are in place to ensure that shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single unified enterprise.
Investec plc is regulated by the FSA in the UK and Investec Limited is regulated by the SARB.
In addition, a number or subsidiaries are subject to the capital regulations of the regulators for the jurisdictions in which they operate.
3 Philosophy and approach As a consequence of the global financial crisis over the past two years, capital adequacy standards for banks globally have been raised.
Investec has always held capital in excess of regulatory requirements and the group intends to perpetuate this philosophy to ensure that it continues to remain well capitalised.
Accordingly, the group maintains capital adequacy targets of a minimum tier one capital ratio of 11% and a total capital adequacy ratio range of 14% to 17%, on a consolidated basis, for Investec plc and Investec Limited, respectively.
The determination of target capital is driven by our risk profile, strategy and risk appetite, taking into account regulatory and market factors applicable to the group.
At the most fundamental level, we seek to balance our capital consumption between prudent capitalisation in the context of the groups risk profile and optimisation of shareholder returns.
Our internal economic capital framework is designed to manage and achieve this balance.
The internal capital framework is tied to groupwide disciplines surrounding: Risk identification, review and assessment Capital allocation and structuring Investment decision making and pricing Risk management, especially as it relates to the selection of deals, markets, and investment opportunities Performance measurement Risk-based incentive compensation.
Consequently the objectives of the internal capital framework are to: Ensure that all identified risks are, where appropriate, incorporated into risk based pricing Maintain sufficient capital to satisfy the boards risk appetite across all risks faced by the group Support a target level of financial strength aligned with a long-term rating of at least A Provide protection to depositors against losses arising from risks inherent in the business Provide sufficient capital surplus to ensure that the group is able to retain its going concern basis under relatively severe operating conditions and support growth in assets Maintain sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements across each regulated entity Support our growth strategy Allow the exploration of acquisition opportunities where such opportunities are consistent with our strategy and risk appetite Facilitate pricing that is commensurate with the risk being taken Allocate capital according to the greatest expected marginal risk based return, and track performance on this basis Reward performance taking into account the relative levels of risk adopted.
The framework has been approved by the board and is managed by the DLC Capital Committee, which is responsible for oversight of the management of capital on a regulatory and an internal basis.

highest professional standards of integrity UK and Europe year in review 3 and behaviour, The turmoil in the financial systems has led to a number of suggested and actual reforms to the international and domestic regulatory and supervisory framework.
Significant work has which builds trust been undertaken at the G20 level and by supra national bodies such as the Financial Stability Board and global standard setters including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions.
In the UK a significant contribution to the debate was provided by the Chairman of the UKs Financial Services Authority in the form of the Turner Review.
This report had a wide scope which included a review of the causes of the crisis, and proposed changes in regulation and supervisory approach needed to create a more robust banking system for the future.
Since then Sir David Walker has published recommendations on corporate governance in financial institutions.
The FSA has responded to Sir Davids recommendations with a range of corporate governance proposals regarding supervision of governance, risk oversight and shareholder engagement.
Capital The regulation and supervision of financial institutions is currently undergoing a period of significant change in response to the global financial crisis.
Increased capital requirements for market risk and securitisations have already been announced by the FSA, and are due for implementation in the UK in 2011.
In December 2009 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a consultative document that outlined proposed changes to the definition of regulatory capital.
These proposals are going through a period of consultation and are expected to be introduced by the beginning of 2013, with substantial transitional arrangements.
Proposals have included: Requiring banks to hold a greater proportion of capital in the form of core tier 1 capital More restrictive definitions of hybrid capital instruments eligible as capital Introduction of a gross leverage ratio Requirement for capital buffers in excess of then-current levels to serve as capital in the event of a downturn.
Liquidity The FSA has now implemented parts of its far-reaching liquidity requirements for banks, building societies and investment firms.
The nature and scale of these changes are clearer in the UK than in many other countries because the FSAs rules have already been published.
However, it is expected that international developments will move in the same direction.
The new FSA rules are based on agreed international liquidity standards, in particular the BCOB Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision, and are focused on two high-level principles.
Firstly, all FSA-regulated entities must have adequate liquidity and, Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 92 secondly, they must not depend on other parts of their group to survive liquidity stresses, unless permitted to do so by the FSA.
Aside from corporate Stress testing governance, during the The FSA made changes to its rules and guidance on stress and scenario testing.
The key period under review changes were: regulatory activity in Introduction of a reverse-stress test requirement.
This requires firms to consider the scenarios most likely to cause their current business model to become unviable the UK has also been Changes to the existing requirements on Pillar 2 capital stress and scenario testing the focused on the following: ICAAP provisions, or where firms use internal models to assess their Pillar 1 capital requirements.
These changes are intended to clarify the FSAs current policy on stress Capital requirements for banks and scenario testing.
3 Liquidity and stress testing This regime will be in force from December 2010.
Remuneration Remuneration practices in financial services Resolution arrangements for banks The FSAs Remuneration Code for large companies in the financial services sector took effect from 1 January 2010.
The Code is designed to achieve two objectives: firstly, that boards Banking Conduct of Business focus more closely on ensuring that the total amount distributed by a firm is consistent BCOB with good risk management and sustainability: and secondly that individual compensation practices provide the right incentives.
Payment services The Code has a general requirement that a firm must establish, implement and maintain Financial Services remuneration policies, procedures and practices that are consistent with and promote effective Compensation Scheme risk management.
Eight principles have been added to the FSAs handbook to ensure firms Anti-money laundering AML understand how the FSA will assess compliance.
Resolution arrangements The Financial Services Act 2010 has placed a duty on the FSA to make rules requiring financial institutions to create and maintain Recovery and Resolution Plans often referred to as living wills to reduce the likelihood of, and the systemic risks associated with, the failure of such institutions.
These living wills will set out the options that firms have if they face financial difficulty the Recovery aspect.
The plan will also describe how the business is run so that, if the Recovery Plan does not work, an administrator has a guide to how to resolve the position the Resolution aspect.
Banking Conduct of Business From 1 November 2009 the FSA commenced regulating the way banks treat their clients.
The new regime creates high level rules in a Banking Conduct of Business Sourcebook BCOBS, alongside the extension of the application of the FSAs General Principles to include the regulated activities of accepting deposits and issuing e-money.
Payment Services Directive The Payment Services Regulations 2009 PSR were introduced in the UK from 1 November 2009.
The PSRs are the UK interpretation of the Payment Services Directive PSD, a European Union initiative to support the Single Euro Payments Area SEPA and to create a single market for payments across Europe.
These regulations came into force in the UK on 1 November 2009.
Under PSD, there is no difference between domestic and cross-border payments.
The PSD makes the payment service activities of banks subject to statutory regulation payment services were previously not the subject of any regulatory conduct of business requirement in Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 93 Compliance continued the UK and were largely left to industry self-regulation under the Banking Codes.
Payment services covered by the PSD include: direct debits, credit transfers, card payments, transferring e-money, money transfers, cash deposits on an account used for the execution of payment transactions, current accounts, flexible savings accounts, combined savings and mortgage accounts.
The additional conduct of business requirements consist of: Rules governing the information that needs to be provided to customers before and after the execution of a payment transaction Rules governing the rights and obligations of both firms and their customers in relation to payment transactions.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme The FSA have introduced a new regime which outlines how the FSA intends to raise awareness and understanding of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
The FSAs intention is to increase public confidence in the scheme and the protection it provides.
The FSA has also put in place a system that ensures that compensation can be paid to the majority of depositors in a target of seven days following the failure 3 of a deposit taker.
The FSA expects the fast payout proposals to provide rapid access to liquid funds for depositors, minimise hardship and increase consumer confidence.
Anti-money laundering We continue to maintain adequate systems and controls to manage the risk from being used in money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crime.
In April 2009 the Bribery Act was enacted replacing the existing legislation in relation to bribery and corruption.
The Act created four main offences including a corporate offence of failing to have adequate systems and controls to prevent bribery.
Senior management has the responsibility to ensure that such systems and controls are in place.
South Africa year in review Anti-money laundering and terror financing The implementation of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act FICA and Protection of Constitutional Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities POCDATARA is ongoing.
The requirements provided by this regulation are set out in the group Anti-Money Laundering and AntiTerror Financing Policy, which incorporates the Client Acceptance Policy.
The AML system, which calculates the risk rating of clients taken on by the business and monitors any changes to the risk ratings of existing clients, continues to be used to implement the Customer Acceptance Policy.
Clients are risk weighted according to the money laundering and or terror financing risks they may potentially pose.
This risk rating includes cross referencing clients against international databases of adverse client information including persons named on the United Nations lists.
Clients assessed as being high risk are required to satisfy enhanced due diligence processes.
The initiative for all business units to implement both the AML and Automated Suspicious Activity Monitoring ASAM systems is ongoing.
Business units not currently using the AML and ASAM systems have alternative controls in place to manage the risks.
The ASAM system, an enhancement to the AML system to address suspicious activity reporting, is operational in the higher risk businesses.
ASAM uses a clients risk weighting together with profiles of the clients transactional behaviour across business unit transactional systems to determine potentially suspicious activities.
Potential suspicions are further investigated to determine whether they need to be reported.
ASAM is being further enhanced to automate cash threshold reporting.
Consumer protection Consumer protection regulation continues to be a focus into 2010 with ongoing monitoring and reporting of compliance with the requirements of the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act FAIS and the National Credit Act NCA.
To better regulate the quality of financial advice, the FSB has introduced amendments to the FAIS Fit and Proper requirements, which deal with the qualifications and experience needed to perform a Representative or Key Individual role for a Financial Services Provider FSP.
Compliance and Human Resources have developed a system to monitor the Fit and Proper status of Representatives and Key Individuals of all licensed Investec FSPs.
The effective dates of the Consumer Protection Act CPA are April and October 2010.
The CPA was enacted to promote a fair, accessible and sustainable marketplace for consumer products and services, promote responsible consumer behaviour, improve standards of consumer Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 94 information and prohibit unfair marketing and business practices.
Group Compliance is overseeing the implementation of the NCA in the affected areas.
The draft Protection of Personal Information Act POPI has been circulated to the industry for comment.
Once enacted POPI will have a material impact on all aspects of Investecs business that concern the processing of personal information in respect of Investecs clients and employees, as well as information relating to Investec group and subsidiaries.
Market conduct, including conflicts of interest The potential conflicts of interest identified through workshops with the respective business areas have been consolidated into a Conflicts Index Matrix for the South African business.
This matrix includes an outline of general conflict types, the business areas between which the conflicts could occur and current mitigations and controls in place to manage the respective conflicts, as well as indicating where enhanced controls are necessary.
3 A specific module of the Enterprise Risk Assessor system ERA is being developed for the recording of the conflicts of interest framework and the documentation of existing controls.
The ERA system will additionally provide the platform for conflicts of interest monitoring.
A South African module of the Voyeur system has been developed.
Voyeur was designed and custom built by the UK Compliance team and is used to manage conflicts of interest.
Voyeur will allow for a more streamlined approach to global conflicts of interest management.
Risk-based monitoring The annual reassessment programme for all relevant legislation loaded on the Enterprise Risk Assessor system ERA is ongoing.
The reassessment includes a re-evaluation of all the risks, controls, treatments and monitoring tests to ensure that these are still relevant.
Our focus has been on thematic monitoring across business areas and on streamlining the monitoring reports to management.
Training The Compliance Awareness Induction Programme CAIP has been run successfully throughout the year.
All new employees are required to attend the face to face version of CAIP and are required to complete and pass an online assessment.
CAIP incorporates modules on: Compliance and the regulatory framework AML and terror financing Consumer protection Market conduct, including conflicts of interest.
To date approximately 600 employees have completed CAIP face to face training.
The material has been adapted to online training so as to broaden the audience of CAIP to all employees.
The online version of CAIP is being piloted in Private Bank during 2010.
Australia year in review There has been increased activity as a result of our regulators, namely the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ASIC, introducing reforms to their supervisory and regulatory frameworks.
During the period under review APRA regulatory activity focused on: Liquidity and risk management Remuneration practices Enhancement of the Basel II framework in Australia.
APRA released its final prudential requirements on remuneration for Australian deposit taking institutions.
APRAs approach recognises that poorly structured remuneration practices may result in excessive risk taking.
These revised governance standards came into effect on 1 April 2010.
The Investec Australia board has reviewed its remuneration practices in light of the new standard and has implemented a Remuneration Policy and Committee.
The introduction of the National Credit Code which replaces the Uniform Consumer Credit Code covers credit activities.
ASIC will become the national regulator for consumer credit.
This means that home loans, personal loans and consumer leases, among other products and services, will be regulated under Commonwealth legislation and administered by ASIC.
Investec Bank Australia is currently assessing the registration and licensing requirements of this legislation.

London Combined Code 2008 The board is of the opinion that, based on the practices disclosed throughout this report, which were in operation during the year under review, Investec has complied with the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice contained in Section 1 of the London Combined Code 2008, excluding the following: Independence of the Chairman: The Chairman, Hugh Herman, is not considered to be independent as, at the time of his appointment and up to 2005, his duties included promoting the group and introducing clients, but excluded day-to-day executive decisions.
His role was full time and he sat on certain management forums.
He was also included in various management incentive schemes.
Board evaluation: The last evaluation of the board, as required by the London Combined Code A.
The next evaluation of the board, its committees and individual directors will be conducted during 2010 and annually thereafter.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 99 Corporate governance continued King III King III was released on 1 September 2009 and came into effect on 1 March 2010, with companies having to apply the principles in respect of financial years commencing on or after 1 March 2010.
King III distinguishes between statutory provisions, voluntary principles and recommended practices.
The King III Report provides best practice recommendations, whereas the King III Code provides the principles that all entities should apply.
Recognition is given to the fact that certain new principles in King III are matters of law, as they are contained in the Companies Act 71 of 2008 the new Companies Act.
As the new Companies Act has not been implemented to date - certain of these principles required by King III have not been adopted or applied.
The board elected to apply the majority of the principles in King III as from 1 March 2010, with the result that we now need to explain how the principles have been or have not been applied.
A schedule referencing how the relevant principles have been applied can be found in the Investec groups 2010 annual report.
A detailed exercise was undertaken to benchmark Investecs practices against the principles required under King III.
The exercise indicated that 3 in substance Investec applies most of the principles, but this will remain work in progress for the remainder of 2010.
The following principles of King III are currently not being applied by Investec: The board should consider business rescue proceedings or other turnaround mechanisms as soon as the company is financially distressed as defined in the Act This principle is a matter of law, as contained in the new Companies Act, which has not been implemented to date The board should elect a chairman of the board who is an independent non-executive director Refer to the explanation above The evaluation of the board, its committees and the individual directors should be performed every year The last evaluation of the board was conducted during 2008.
The next evaluation of the board, its committees and the individual directors will be conducted during 2010 and annually thereafter Companies should disclose the remuneration of the three most highly paid employees.
Details of the directors remuneration and the groups remuneration process are set out in the Remuneration report on pages 104 to 123 The new Companies Act, which has not been implemented to date, requires that the remuneration of the companies prescribed officers be disclosed.
The board will resolve on the identity of the prescribed officers as and when required under the new Companies Act Sustainability reporting and disclosure should be independently assured We do not believe that this is necessary given the nature of our business and level of sustainability reporting required The Audit Committees have overseen the sustainability report and the content of the report has been verified by the Internal Audit division.

The board believes that a properly constituted and effective Remuneration Committee is key to improving the link between pay and performance.
The committee in that remuneration consists entirely of non-executive directors, and executive directors are not involved in has been widely determining their own remuneration packages.
This report describes our remuneration policy and directors remuneration for the 2010 financial year.
discussed by Overview regulators, This has been an unprecedented year in that remuneration has been widely discussed politicians and the by regulators, politicians and the public across the jurisdictions in which we operate.
It is public across the incumbent on a public company to reflect upon these changes.
4 The committee, in addition to its regular business, has reviewed a comprehensive survey jurisdictions in of the new remuneration regulations and changing attitudes in all our core geographies.
An which we operate extensive gap analysis was done to capture the extent of the changes required of us and we have received independent confirmation that this analysis was comprehensive and robust.
There are some subtle nuances and differences in the requirements across the geographies in which we operate.
We have concluded that Investecs long-standing fundamental remuneration philosophies are consistent with these requirements.
Our overall remuneration philosophy and practices have thus remained largely unchanged from the prior year.
At the level of operational implementation we have, however, made some changes to the detail of our approach in order to be more closely aligned with these new requirements.
We have worked hard at closing any gaps and believe we comply with the substance of these various regulations.
The committee continues to consider remuneration policies and packages of the executive directors, persons discharging managerial responsibilities, a number of other senior and highly paid employees across the group, as well as paying specific attention to the rewards allocated to employees within the Internal Audit, Compliance and Risk divisions.
Talent management and the retention of senior management and executives remained key items on our agenda during the year.
We are conscious of the need to constantly refresh the means of incentivising our staff in order to meet the pressures of competition in our labour markets within the context of a much changed global landscape.
Remuneration in context The details of our remuneration philosophy, practices and programmes are detailed later in this report.
In summary, we recognise that banks have to divide the return from their enterprises between the suppliers of capital and labour and the societies in which they do business, the latter through taxation and corporate social responsibility activities.
Our global remuneration philosophy seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the interests of these stakeholders, and is closely aligned to our core values and philosophies which include risk consciousness: meritocracy: material employee ownership: and an unselfish contribution to colleagues, clients and society.
Over the last five years our consolidated compensation ratio has been between 35% and 40%, with a 10 year average of 42%, reflecting a key emphasis on balancing risks, rewards Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 104 and incentives.
We note that several investment banks which used to operate at higher ratios have more recently reduced to this level.
We encourage our employees to be shareholders Staff compensation ratio and thus also derive benefits from the organisation through the returns on their shareholdings.
The proportion of shares owned directly and indirectly by employees is approximately 15%.
36.1% Remuneration and effective risk management Risk management is embedded in the organisational culture from the initiation of transactional activity through to the monitoring of adherence to mandates and limits.
The Board Risk and Capital Committee determines the categories of risk, the specific types of risks and Total shareholder return the extent of such risks which the group should undertake, as well as the mitigation of risks and overall capital management and allocation process.
This is executed via a number Investec plc of forums and internal processes on a day to day basis, with risk functions that are both return embedded in business units as well as subject to oversight by independent central risk functions.
90.6% We have, for in excess of 10 years, applied a variable performance reward model which is 4 closely linked to business profit performance using a realised Economic Value Added EVA model against pre-determined targets above risk and capital weighted returns.
Independent Investec Limited risk committees approve all limits and risk exposures.
In terms of the EVA structure, capital is allocated based on risk and therefore the higher the risk, the higher the capital allocation and return the higher the hurdle return rate required.
This model, which has remained largely unchanged for several years, ensures that risk and capital management form the basis for key processes 65.1% at both a group and transaction level thus balancing the rewards between all stakeholders.
The persons responsible for alignment of all stakeholder interests are the various risk managers of the group as well as the group executive whose awards are not linked to specific FTSE 350 Index performance based on a formula but on the overall performance of the group taking into consideration financial performance, compliance with culture and values and numerous other return qualitative factors set out later in this report.
49.8% Year in review In addition to the information provided above, key points to note for the period under review include: Investecs recurring revenue base and operational diversity have continued to support profitability across its core geographies.
Core capital and liquidity ratios remain sound and the group has reported attributable earnings of 309.7 million 2009: 269.2 million.
Further information on our risk management indicators, policies and procedures and the groups performance can be found on pages 27 to 29 and pages 54 to 58 The total staff compensation to operating income ratio is 36.1% 2009: 34.9% 30.1 million of the current years variable remuneration has been paid in the form of share awards and deferred representing 16.6% of our variable remuneration expense for the year Non-executive directors will receive a modest increase in their fees in the forthcoming year, roughly in line with inflation Our total shareholder return was 90.6% for Investec plc in Pounds Sterling and 65.1% for Investec Limited in Rands.
This compares to a return of 49.8% for the FTSE 350 General Finance Index and a return of 50.4% for the FTSE 100 Index.
Towards the end of our financial year, Investec plc was included as a new entrant to the FTSE 100 index.

We strive to inspire entrepreneurship by merit and valuesproviding a working environment that stimulates extraordinary performance, so that executive based culture, directors and employees may be positive contributors to our clients, their communities and the group.
characterised by We reward executive directors and employees for their contribution through: passion, energy payment of an industry competitive annual package base salary and benefits and stamina a variable performance reward linked to our EVA model as discussed on pages 109 and 110 ownership in the form of share incentive scheme participation.
4 We tend to look at the aggregate of the above as the overall remuneration package designed to attract, retain, incentivise and drive the behaviour of our employees over the short, medium and longer term.
Overall rewards are considered as important as our core values of work content greater responsibility, variety of work and high level of challenge and work affiliation entrepreneurial feel to the company and unique culture in the attraction, retention and motivation of employees.
We have a strong entrepreneurial, merit and values-based culture, characterised by passion, energy and stamina.
The ability to live and perpetuate our values, culture and philosophies in the pursuit of excellence is considered paramount in determining overall reward levels.
The type of people the organisation attracts, and the culture and environment within which they work, remain crucial in determining our success and long-term progress.
Our reward programmes are clear and transparent, designed and administered to align directors and employees interests with those of all stakeholders and ensure the groups short and long-term success.
Remuneration policy The key principles of our remuneration policy for executive directors and employees, which were consistently applied during the financial year, are as follows: Total rewards comprise a fixed and variable component The fixed component of our rewards includes a base salary, pension and benefits and is set at median market levels to keep fixed cost elements low Variable rewards a portion of which is deferred for senior employees are largely EVA based and underpinned by our risk appetite and capital utilisation as discussed on pages 86 to 90 Long-term share incentive participation ensures alignment with stakeholders Total compensation base salary, pension, benefits and incentives is targeted in normal market conditions to the relevant competitive market see below at upper quartile levels for superior performance We do not apply an upper limit on performance bonuses given our risk based EVA approach and prefer to contain the fixed cost component of remuneration at modest levels.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 107 Remuneration report continued Qualitative and quantitative issues form an integral part of the determination of reward levels.
Key inputs into the reward process are as follows: The reward package for A significant proportion of rewards, including annual and long-term incentive components, are explicitly linked to the performance of the business and the individual business units executive directors and We recognise the performance of the business and the individual employees comprises: An individuals alignment with and adherence to our culture and values system is a key consideration Base salary and benefits Other aspects considered include, for example, attitude displayed towards risk Annual performance bonuses consciousness: the level of co-operation and collaboration fostered: the ability to grow Long-term share incentive and develop markets: the possible replacement cost of such individuals.
plans Reward levels are targeted to be commercially competitive, on the following basis: The most relevant competitive reference points for reward levels are based on the scope of responsibility and individual contributions made Appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices 4 are reviewed regularly For executive directors, the FTSE 350 General Finance firms have provided the most appropriate benchmark to date For employees, combinations of firms from the JSE Financial 15 and the FTSE 350 General Finance sector have offered the most appropriate benchmark The committee also reviews data on other international banks with which we compete, including certain FTSE 100 companies The committee recognises that we operate an international business and compete with both local and international competitors in each of our markets In order to avoid disproportionate packages across areas of the group and between executives, adjustments are made at any extremes to ensure broad internal consistency.
Adjustments may also be made to the competitive positioning of pay components for individuals, in cases where a higher level of investment is needed in order to build or grow either a business unit or our capability in a geography.
Components of remuneration The elements of the reward package, as listed above, are discussed below and the components for each director are detailed in tables accompanying this report.
As a consequence of the global financial markets crisis and the resultant debate and review surrounding remuneration policies and procedures, the committee has made a few changes to the components of our reward programmes.
Base salary and benefits Salaries are reviewed annually and reflect the relative skills and experience of, and contribution made by, the individual.
It is the companys policy to set base salaries including benefits at median market levels.
Benefits are targeted at competitive levels and are delivered through flexible and tailored packages.
Benefits include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: medical cover: and other benefits, as dictated by competitive local market practices.
Only salaries are pensionable, the annual bonuses paid are not.
Our disclosure of executive directors salaries on page 117 has been done on a gross basis i. e. inclusive of pension fund contributions from the company.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 108 Annual performance bonus Annual performance bonuses are closely linked to business performance, based on target Developments over business unit performance goals determined in the main by realised EVA profit performance against pre-determined targets above a risk and capital weighted return.
These targets have the past year been in force, and unchanged, for the past few years and are subject to annual review.
During the prior financial year the group refined its performance EVA model and process bonus policies by introducing a Our business strategy and associated risk appetite, together with effective capital utilisation, non-cash element in the form of form the key cornerstones which underpin the EVA annual bonus allocation model.
This model has been consistently applied for more than 10 years and encompasses the following forfeitable share awards for all principals and processes: employees whose bonuses Targeted returns differ by business unit reflecting the competitive economics and exceed a pre-determined hurdle shareholder expectation for the specific area of business, and are set with reference level and by introducing a formal to competitive benchmarks for each product line.
In essence varying levels of return deferral requirement.
These are required for each business unit reflecting the state of market maturity, country of 4 awards are made in terms of our operation, risk, capital invested capital intensive businesses or expected expense base existing long-term incentive plans fee-based businesses Capital allocated is a function of both regulatory and internal capital requirements, the risk During the current year, the assumed within the business and our overall business strategy pre-determined hurdle level was The group has always held capital in excess of minimum regulatory requirements, and increased and the deferral period this philosophy is perpetuated in our internal capital allocation process.
This process was extended from 11 months to ensures that risk and capital discipline is embedded at the level of deal initiation and two years incorporates independent approval outside of the business unit of transactions by the various risk committees.
A detailed explanation of our capital management and allocation process is provided in the Investec groups 2010 annual report Growth in profitability over time will result in an increasing incentive pool, as long as it is not achieved at the expense of capital efficiency Target returns must be reflective of the inherent risk assumed in the business.
Thus, an increase in absolute profitability does not automatically result in an increase in the annual bonus pool.
This approach allows us to embed risk and capital discipline in our business processes A fixed predetermined percentage of any return in excess of the EVA hurdle accrues to the business units EVA pool A portion of the total EVA pool is allocated towards the bonus pool for central service and head office employees Once the annual determination of the EVA pools is complete, line managers in each business unit will make discretionary bonus recommendations for each team member taking into consideration qualitative and quantitative criteria as mentioned above Bonus recommendations are then subject to an extensive geographic review involving Human Resources, local management and local remuneration committees Thereafter, these recommendations are subject to a global review by executive management, before the DLC Remuneration Committee review and approval process.
In terms of our EVA process, if business and individual performance goals are achieved or bettered, the variable element of the total reward package is likely to be substantially higher than the relevant target market.
This ensures that overall reward levels are positioned at the upper quartile level for superior performance, in line with our overriding remuneration policy.

Share option and long-term share incentive plans We have a number of share option and long-term share incentive plans that are designed to link the interests of directors and employees with those of shareholders and long-term organisational interests, through performance and risk-based equity grants.
Prior to the implementation of our DLC structure and our listing on the London Stock Exchange in July 2002, we had a number of share option, share purchase and leveraged share schemes in place that were appropriate for a South African listed company.
However, at the time of the London listing it was necessary for us to consider implementing a more internationally recognised share scheme structure and philosophy.
As a result, a number of share option plans were introduced to cater for regulatory, tax and other considerations pertaining to the various jurisdictions in which we operated.
At the same time, however, a decision was taken to maintain the schemes that were in place prior to the London listing until the allocations made in terms of those schemes matured.
While this gives rise to what appears to be a multitude of schemes, the philosophy and practical implications are fairly simple the appropriate level of equity allocation is determined for each employee and then awards are made out of the scheme that is considered most appropriate for that individual given his her location, tax and regulatory environment.
The share option and long-term share incentive plans in operation, and in which the directors are eligible to participate, are summarised in the table below and further details are provided on our website.
Executive directors collectively hold approximately 2.1% of our issued share capital.

The limits for allocations to employees and executive management during a financial year may be exceeded if the directors determine that exceptional circumstances make it desirable that options should be granted in excess of that limit.
These conditions require growth in headline earnings per share EPS over the relevant option period to equal or exceed the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 3% compounded annually over the same period.
In choosing the performance targets for this plan, the committee considered the merits of EPS-based targets against other possibilities, such as comparative performance or comparative growth in ROE against a basket of other companies.
The committee determined that EPS-based targets are most appropriate as they measure our underlying growth.
The committee intends to continue to apply this during the 2011 financial year but keeps the matter of the suitability of target-linked share based remuneration under periodic review.
This note does not apply to the Share Matching Plan 2005 which has different performance conditions as approved by shareholders further information is available on our website.
This represents the number of awards made to all participants.
More details on the directors shareholdings are also provided in tables accompanying this report.
Dilution limits: Investec is committed to following the Association of British Insurers ABI guidelines and, accordingly, as from the date of the implementation of our DLC structure 29 July 2002, the maximum number of new shares which may be issued by the company under all of the share plans in respect of grants made after July 2002 may not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the company over a rolling 10 year period.
The committee regularly monitors the utilisation of dilution limits and available headroom to ensure that these guidelines are complied with.
The issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited at 31 March 2010 was 471.1 million shares and 269.8 million shares respectively.
As announced on the stock exchange news services, 2.2 million Investec plc and 0.7 million Investec Limited shares were issued to the staff share schemes during the year.
The market price of an Investec plc share as at 31 March 2010 was 5.39 2009: 2.92, ranging from a low of 2.87 to a high of 5.62 during the financial year.
The market price of an Investec Limited share as at 31 March 2010 was R62.49 2009: R38.86, ranging from a low of R37.51 to a high of R65.40 during the financial year.
The rules of these long-term incentive plans do not allow awards to be made to executive directors.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 113 Remuneration report continued Non-executive directors remuneration The board agrees and determines the fees of non-executive directors and the fees are reviewed annually.
The boards policy is that fees should reflect individual responsibilities and membership of board committees.
In view of the current market conditions and the focus on controlling fixed remuneration, it was decided that the non-executive directors will receive a modest increase in their fees in the forthcoming year, roughly in line with inflation.
Their fee structure covers the dual roles that the directors perform for the UK listed Investec plc and the South African listed Investec Limited boards.
The fee structure for non-executive directors for the 2010 and 2011 financial years is shown below: As approved by the board Non-executive directors remuneration 2010 financial year for the 2011 financial year Chairmans total fee 360 000 per year 375 000 per year Basic non-executive director fee 53 000 per year 55 000 per year Chairman of the DLC Audit Committee 45 000 per year 47 000 per year Chairman of the DLC Remuneration Committee 32 000 per year 33 500 per year Member of the DLC Audit Committee 13 000 per year 13 500 per year 4 Member of the DLC Remuneration Committee 12 500 per year 13 000 per year Member of DLC Nomination and Directors Affairs Committee Nil 9 500 per year Member of Investec Bank plc board 9 000 per year 9 500 per year Member of the Investec Bank Limited board R150 000 per year R160 000 per year Fees are also payable for any additional time committed to the group including attendance at certain other meetings.
There is no requirement for non-executive directors to hold shares in the company.
The company has left this choice to the discretion of each non-executive director.
Governance section Compliance and governance statement The Remuneration Report complies with the provisions of the 2008 London Combined Code, Section 420 of the UK Companies Act 2006, the UK Financial Services Authority Listing Rules, the South African King III Code of Corporate Practice and Conduct and the JSE Limited Listing Rules.
In addition, as mentioned elsewhere in this report, the committee has reviewed an extensive survey of the new remuneration regulations and changing attitudes in all of our core geographies and concluded that Investecs long-standing fundamental remuneration philosophies are consistent with these requirements.
Notably, the committee believes that the group is in principle compliant with the eight principles contained in the FSAs Remuneration Code of Practice.
Composition and role of the committee George Alford Chairman, Geoffrey Howe and Sir Chips Keswick were members of the committee throughout the year.
Sir David Prosser was appointed as a member on 9 September 2009.
The members are all independent non-executive directors and are free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Three out of the four members are also members of the groups Board Risk and Capital Committee and all members are also members of the Audit Committee, thus bringing risk and control mechanisms into their deliberations.
The committees principal responsibilities and objectives are to: Determine, develop and agree with the board, the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of executive directors and executive management comprising individuals discharging managerial responsibilities, who are the global heads of our core areas of activity and are members of our Global Operations Forum Ensure that qualified and experienced management and executives will be provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and will be, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their contribution to the success of the group and alignment with the corporate objectives and business strategy Review and approve the design of, and determine targets and objectives for, any performance related pay schemes operated by the group and approve the aggregate annual payouts under such schemes Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 114 Review and approve, within the terms of the agreed policy, the total individual remuneration packages of executive directors and executive management including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share scheme awards Review and approve, within the terms of the agreed policy, the total individual remuneration packages of members of the internal audit, risk and compliance functions Oversee any major changes in our employee benefit structures Ensure that the comments, recommendations and rules within the UK and South Africa pertaining to remuneration are given due regard.
The committee is authorised by the board to seek any information it requires from any employee in order to perform its duties.
The committees terms of reference are available on our website.
Meetings The committee met nine times during the financial year with full attendance other than for three meetings which Sir Chips Keswick was unable to attend.
Sir David Prosser attended all the meetings that followed his date of appointment to the committee.
The Company Secretary of Investec plc acts as Secretary to the committee.
Executive directors do not attend these meetings.
The Chairman of the committee reports on the activities of the committee at each meeting of the full board.
4 Advisers to the committee Where appropriate, the committee has access to independent executive remuneration consultants.
The selection of the advisers is at the discretion of the committee Chairman, and Investec funds any expenses relating to the appointment of external consultants.
During the financial year, the committee continued to use the services of its advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, which among other things specifically reviewed and provided information on industry consultation papers, regulations and developments with respect to remuneration practices and our alignment to them.
In addition, they continued to review and provide information on appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices.
Their recommendations are important in the ongoing review of our remuneration practices.
Furthermore, we have used the services of Linklaters, who have advised this year mainly on issues pertaining to our incentive plans.
Linklaters is one of Investec plcs legal advisers.
Certain specialist divisions within the group, for example Human Resources and the Staff Shares division, provide supporting information and documentation relating to matters that are presented to the committee.
This includes, for example, comparative data and motivations for proposed salary, bonus and share awards.
The variable remuneration pools are determined by our Finance teams taking into account risk adjusted capital requirements and after eliminating unrealised gains.
The employees within these specialist divisions, who provide support to the committee, are not board directors and are not appointed by the committee.
The committee, together with the board, attends a strategic offsite each year at which senior executive employees provide information and presentations on the groups strategic direction, prospects, key focus areas and annual budget.
While executive directors have the right to address any meeting of the committee, they play no role in the determination of their remuneration package.
Furthermore, no employee participates in discussions or decisions of the committee relating to their own remuneration.
Service contracts and terms of employment Our executive directors have indefinite contracts of employment, terminable by either party giving six months written notice to the other.
Each executive director is entitled to receive a basic salary and is also eligible for an annual bonus, the amount of which will be determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Furthermore, the executive directors may elect to sacrifice a portion of their annual salary to receive company benefits such as a travel allowance and medical aid.
The full costs of these benefits are deducted from their annual salary.
The contracts of employment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Executive directors are permitted to accept outside appointments on external boards or committees so long as these are not deemed to interfere with the business of the company.
Any fees earned by executives in this regard are not retained and are given back to the respective companies.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and letters of appointment confirm the terms and conditions of their service.
The letters of appointment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Unless the non-executive directors resign earlier or are removed from their positions, they will remain as directors until the close of our Annual General Meeting in 2011 subject to rotational reelection as directors at the 2010 meeting and in terms of the provision of the Articles of Association.
All non-executive directors who have been members of the board for longer than nine years are subject to annual re-election as required in terms of our Articles of Association.
Those directors seeking rotational re-election at the 2010 annual general meeting are shown on pages 131 to 134.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 115 Remuneration report continued Biographical details of the directors of the board These details can be found on pages 131 to 134.
Dates of appointment to the board The boards of Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate and subject to different legal obligations for each company.
In terms of the DLC arrangements, they comprise the same persons who are authorised, as boards, to manage Investec as if it were a unified economic enterprise.
Details on the dates the directors were appointed to the board can be found on page 98.
Performance graph total shareholder return We have implemented a DLC structure, in terms of which we have premium primary listings in London and Johannesburg.
The listing on the London Stock Exchange LSE took place on 29 July 2002, although we have been listed in South Africa since 1986.
Section 420 of the UK Companies Act 2006 requires this report to include a performance graph of Investec plcs total shareholder return TSR performance against that of a broad market index.
We found it difficult to locate an appropriate group of companies to benchmark ourselves against because of our specialist activities.
A number of companies within the FTSE 350 General Finance Index conduct similar activities to us, 4 although they do not necessarily have the same geographical profile.
Nevertheless, to date this has been the most appropriate index against which to measure our performance on the LSE.
The graph below shows the cumulative shareholder return for a holding of our shares in green in Pounds Sterling on the LSE, compared with the average total shareholder return of other members of the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
It shows that, at 31 March 2010, a hypothetical 100 invested in Investec plc at the time of its listing on the LSE in July 2002 would have generated a total return of 514 compared with a return of 111 if invested in the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
Investec plc has therefore outperformed the FTSE 350 General Finance Index over the period.
Towards the end of our financial year, Investec plc was included as a new entrant into the FTSE 100 Index.
We have included the total shareholder return of that index for illustrative purposes.
During the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010, the return to shareholders of Investec plc measured in Pounds Sterling and Investec Limited measured in Rands was 90.6% and 65.1%, respectively.
This compares to a return of 49.8% for the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
The market price of our shares on the LSE was 5.39 as at 31 March 2010, ranging from a low of 2.87 to a high of 5.62 during the financial year.
Furthermore, the market price of our shares on the JSE Limited was R62.49 as at 31 March 2010, ranging from a low of R37.51 to a high of R65.40 during the financial year.
Gross remuneration comprises base salary and other benefits see point 2 and 3 below.
Gross remuneration of S Koseff, B Kantor and A Tapnack has on average declined by approximately 2%.
The gross remuneration of GR Burger is determined in Rands and converted into Pounds Sterling.
In Rand terms GR Burgers gross remuneration remained at R3 050 000 for the 2010 and 2009 financial years.
Gross remuneration increases for other employees across the group have generally been in the range of 0% to 8%.
For the 2011 financial year it is proposed that the executive directors will receive salary increases roughly in line with inflation.
The executive directors receive other benefits which may include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: and medical cover, on similar terms to other senior executives.
In determining annual bonuses, a number of quantitative and qualitative factors metrics were considered which included: The group recorded an increase in attributable earnings, dividends per share and total shareholder return The group reported operating profits in all of its core geographies, benefiting from its recurring income base The group further improved the quality of its balance sheet, with an increase in both capital and liquidity over the period.
Leverage ratios remain low and the group has further reduced reliance on wholesale funding The group has made significant progress in increasing its non-lending revenue base and further balancing the revenue generated 4 from its operational risk businesses and its financial risk businesses.
Initiatives and developments in this regard include: the substantial increase in funds under management over the period: the group is in the process of establishing a global wealth management division: and the acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc The group has maintained its capital strength over the past two years without recourse to shareholders, new investors or government assistance.
Investec has demonstrated its resilience in the face of the worst financial crisis in decades A focused and intimate involvement of the executive directors in ensuring stringent management of risk, liquidity and capital Investment in the Investec brand continues to deliver shareholder value Business units have moved onto the front foot and are taking advantage of new opportunities Continuous engagement with key stakeholders.
Over the past two years, in addition to our day-to-day communication with all stakeholders, executive management conducted several roadshows presenting to clients, employees and investors on the financial and operating position of the group in order to give a sense of comfort during this difficult and uncertain period The group has maintained its commitment to its sustainability efforts, and received a number of awards in this area.
Further information on the groups performance and risk management metrics have been discussed elsewhere in the annual report.
Based on comparator analyses provided by the committees advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, the total remuneration of the executive directors falls within median market levels.
S Koseff and B Kantor are each awarded a total bonus of 2 250 000, comprising 990 000 in cash payable in June 2010 and the balance deferred and payable in two equal installments on 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.
The deferred component will be equivalent to the value of 133 475 Investec plc shares at the close of business on each of 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.
For annual report disclosure and reporting purposes the deferred component was determined at the Remuneration Committee meeting held on 1 June 2010 at a price per share of 4.72 GR Burger has been awarded a total bonus of R24 000 000, comprising R10 500 000 in cash payable in June 2010 and the balance deferred and payable in two equal installments on 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.
The deferred component will be equivalent to the value of 121 622 Investec Limited shares at the close of business on each of 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.
For annual report disclosure and reporting purposes the deferred component was determined at the Remuneration Committee meeting held on 1 June 2010 at a price per share of R55.50 A Tapnack has been awarded a total bonus of 350 000, comprising 230 000 in cash payable in June 2010 and the balance deferred and payable in two equal installments on 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.
The deferred component will be equivalent to the value of 12 712 Investec plc shares at the close of business on each of 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.
For annual report disclosure and reporting purposes the deferred component was determined at the Remuneration Committee meeting held on 1 June 2010 at a price per share of 4.72.

Investecs sustainability efforts, referred to as Our Business Responsibility, are based on the Responsibility is recognition that we are a specialist bank and asset manager driven by our culture and values.
divided into the Investecs endeavours to pursue sustainable profits include having a positive impact in each areas of profit, of the societies in which our business activities operate.
We aim to do this by enriching communities through education and entrepreneurship and embracing diversity while people and planet constantly striving to reduce the overall size of our environmental footprint.
Despite the difficult economic conditions of 2009, Investec has continued to maintain its commitment to Our Business Responsibility as an integral part of how we do business.
Accordingly, Investec was recognised for its sustainability efforts receiving a number of awards in this area.
In addition, Corporate Social Investment in South Africa was awarded the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies CSI Leadership Award.
This award recognises companies that excel in terms of financial performance but that also demonstrate an interest in the broader socio-economic environment.
Investec maintained its presence in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the UKs FTSE4Good Index and the JSE-SRI Index in South Africa.
6 Profit In the past two years, Investec has demonstrated its financial strength and resilience in the face of the worst financial crisis in decades.
Investecs business model aims to deliver sustainable success.
The groups rigorous management of risk, which preserves stakeholders interests, together with its fierce protection of the companys reputation, are essential elements of this model.
Diversifying sources of funding has been a key element of the groups strategy to further improve the quality of the groups balance sheet and reduce reliance on wholesale funding.
During the 2010 financial year, the group was successful in growing customer deposits in all three core geographies, significantly growing funds under management and substantially increasing its cash and near cash balances.
The economic environment remains fragile, and a number of challenges remain.
However, the groups solid capital and liquidity position continues to support our efforts to capitalise on the commercial opportunities that are starting to be revealed as the international landscape adjusts.
People Investec employees remain critical to continued business success and to overall sustainability efforts.
The expertise and dedication of staff is fundamental in meeting clients needs and delivering distinctive results.
It is therefore vital that we engage, develop and retain a highvalue workforce.
One of the groups values is to ensure open and honest communication and hence encourage an active and open dialogue between staff and senior management.
As a responsible employer, Investec aims to offer staff a stimulating and progressive working environment in which they can flourish and realise their true potential.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 140 In a difficult environment, we seek personal dialogue with clients and continue to provide creative solutions tailored to their individual financial requirements.
Our clients benefit directly from the experience we have gained in navigating the recent crisis and we are committed to Looking forward, we helping them meet their financial goals.

size of our overall Investecs role in society and as a responsible citizen remains a key priority.
To contribute to the upliftment and empowerment of the communities within which we operate, we engage in environmental a number of ways.
We strive to work with a particular focus on education and entrepreneurial projects.
In 2010, our businesses committed over 3.9 million to a range of community footprint initiatives around the world.
Planet With the signing of the Copenhagen Accord in December 2009 climate change has become a key area of international focus.
Investec completed a formal carbon footprint exercise during 2009 in agreement with the Greenhouse Gas GHG Protocol, which will form the basis for further attempts at reducing our energy consumption over the medium term.
Towards the end of the financial year, we launched a carbon footprint campaign to employees which used strategic collateral to encourage staff to do what they can to reduce their carbon footprint both in the workplace and at home.
The aim of the campaign was to raise awareness around carbon footprinting, provide a basic understanding and recommendations around what steps 6 can be taken to effect necessary reductions.
On an operational level, we continue to apply a clearly defined risk review process in order to carefully assess business transactions with potential environmental or social risks.
Looking forward, we will continue to focus on reducing the size of our overall environmental footprint.
Accordingly, Investec management has been engaging with external consultants on an exercise designed to clarify the perceived risks and opportunities relating to climate change for the group and its various businesses.
Outlook The past year has seen heightened global attention on corporate governance, risk management and reputational issues and the financial services industry as a whole has been under considerable public scrutiny.
Throughout this we have remained open for business and, at the same time, have reinforced our commitment to be a responsible lender, providing access to credit and support while maintaining sensible lending standards.
We are making good progress in embedding sustainability into our business.
We recognise, however, that we have some way to go and will continue to build Our Business Responsibility efforts in the year ahead.
We remain committed to offering a robust, secure and responsible service that contributes to the economic progress of the group and society as a whole.

David Miller Benita Coetsee Company Secretary Company Secretary Investec plc Investec Limited 21 June 2010 Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 148 Directors Responsibility statement The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Auditors report set out on page 155, is made with a view to distinguishing for stakeholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditors in relation to the combined consolidated financial statements.
The directors are responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the combined consolidated financial statements that fairly present the state of affairs of the company and the group at the end of the financial year and the net income and cash flows for the year, and other information contained in this report.
To enable the directors to meet these responsibilities: The board and management set standards and management implements systems of internal controls and accounting and information systems aimed at providing reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and the risk of fraud, error or loss is reduced in a cost effective manner.
These controls, contained in established policies and procedures, include the proper delegation of responsibilities and authorities within a clearly defined framework, effective accounting procedures and adequate segregation of duties The groups Internal Audit function, which operates unimpeded and independently from operational management, and has unrestricted access to the group Audit Committee, appraises and, when necessary, recommends improvements in the system of internal controls and accounting practices, based on audit plans that take cognisance of the relative degrees of risk of each function or aspect of the business The group Audit Committee, together with the Internal Audit department, plays an integral role in matters relating to financial and internal control, accounting policies, reporting and disclosure.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, based on the above, the directors are satisfied that no material breakdown in the operation of the system of internal control and procedures has occurred during the year under review.
The group consistently adopts appropriate and recognised accounting policies and these are supported by reasonable judgements and estimates on a consistent basis and provides additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the groups financial position and financial performance.
The financial statements of the company and the group have been prepared in accordance with the respective Companies Acts of the United Kingdom and South Africa, comply with IFRS and Article 4 of the IAS regulation.

These financial statements have been prepared on that basis.
It is the responsibility of the independent auditors to report on the combined consolidated financial statements.
Their report to the members of the company and group is set out on page 155 of this report.
As far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the companies auditors are unaware.
All steps which ought to have been taken as directors have been completed in order to be aware of the relevant audit information and to establish that the companies auditors are aware of that information.
Approval of financial statements The Directors report and the financial statements of the company and the group, which appear on pages 144 to 148 and pages 156 to 174, were approved by the board of directors on 21 June 2010.

At 31 March 2010, IFRS standards as endorsed by the EU are identical to current IFRSs applicable to the group.
The group financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties, available for sale investments, derivative financial instruments, financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss or subject to hedge accounting, liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments and pension fund surpluses and deficits that have been measured at fair value.
Accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the prior year, except for the adoption of the following amendments: IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, an amendment to IFRS 7 The group has applied the improvement that requires enhanced disclosures about financial instruments.
The amended standard requires additional disclosure about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised Adoption of this standard has resulted in the reformatting of the statement of total recognised gains and losses into a statement of comprehensive income.
These changes have had no impact on the recognition and measurement policies applied by the group.
Restatements The group applies a policy of offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities when there is both an intention to settle on a net basis or simultaneously and a legal right to offset exists.
With regard to derivative instruments, the group identified that in certain isolated instances offsetting was applied in prior financial periods to derivative assets and liabilities where it is not market practice to settle net, whilst the legal right to settle net exists.
The impact of this restatement on the balance sheet of the two prior years is noted below: '000 31 Mar 2009 31 Mar 2008 7 Restated Derivative financial instrument assets 1 843 143 1 425 587 Derivative financial instrument liabilities 1 456 561 1 001 900 As previously reported Derivative financial instrument assets 1 582 908 1 305 264 Derivative financial instrument liabilities 1 196 326 881 577 Change to previously reported Derivative financial instrument assets 260 235 120 323 Derivative financial instrument liabilities 260 235 120 323 On the basis that the above restatements had no impact on equity, nor the net cash position and materiality, a balance sheet for 2008 has not been presented.
Investec Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 PAGE 162 Basis of consolidation Investec consists of two separate legal entities, being Investec plc and Investec Limited that operate under a dual listed company DLC structure.
The effect of the DLC structure is that Investec plc and its subsidiaries and Investec Limited and its subsidiaries operate together as a single economic entity, with neither assuming a dominant role and accordingly are reported as a single reporting entity under IFRS.
All subsidiaries and special purpose vehicles in which the group holds more than one half of the voting rights or over which it has the ability to control either directly or in substance are consolidated from the effective dates of acquisition that is from when control exists and up to the effective dates of loss of control, except entities which are classified as non-current assets held for sale.
Subsidiaries classified as non-current assets held for sale are consolidated in one line item as discontinued operations.
Entities, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the group exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies, are treated as associates.
In the group accounts, associates are accounted for using the equity method from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases, except as noted below.
The combined consolidated financial statements include the attributable share of the results and reserves of associated undertakings.
The groups interests in associated undertakings are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost plus the post acquisition changes in the groups share of the net assets of the associate.
In circumstances where associates or joint venture holdings arise in which the group has no strategic intention, these investments are classified as venture capital holdings and are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
All intergroup balances, transactions and unrealised gains and losses within the group are eliminated to the extent that they do not reflect an impairment to the asset.
