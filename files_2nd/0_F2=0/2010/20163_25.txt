Financial statements Significant accounting policies 96 96 G Carried interest i Carried interest receivable The Group earns a share of profits carried interest receivable from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties.
These profits are earned once the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest receivable is only accrued on those managed funds in which the funds performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in the fund were realised at fair value.
Fair value is determined using the Groups valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date.
An accrual is made equal to the Groups share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
ii Carried interest payable The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments.
Carried interest payable is the term used for amounts payable to executives on investment-related transactions.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest scheme.
Carried interest payable is only accrued on those schemes in which the schemes performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in the scheme were realised at fair value.
An accrual is made equal to the executives share of profits in excess of the performance conditions in place in the carried interest scheme.
H Property, plant and equipment i Land and buildings Land and buildings are carried in the balance sheet at fair value less depreciation and impairment.
Fair value is determined at each balance sheet date from valuations undertaken by professional valuers using market-based evidence.
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income and credited to the Capital reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous valuation deficit on the same asset recognised in profit or loss in which case the surplus is recognised in profit or loss to the extent of the previous deficit.
Any revaluation deficit that offsets a previously recognised surplus in the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Capital reserve.
Any excess valuation deficit over and above that previously recognised in surplus is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Depreciation on revalued buildings is charged in the statement of comprehensive income over their estimated useful life, generally over 50 years.
ii Vehicles and office equipment Vehicles and office equipment are depreciated by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows: office equipment five years: computer equipment three years: computer software three years: motor vehicles four years.
iii Assets held under finance leases Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful life on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the lease term.
Assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the agreement and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
I Treasury assets and liabilities Short-term treasury assets and short and long-term treasury liabilities are used in order to manage cash flows and overall costs of borrowing.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the relevant Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
fide-recognition occurs when rights to cash flows from a financial asset expire, or when a liability is extinguished.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits as defined above and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, net of bank overdrafts.
ii Deposits Deposits in the balance sheet comprise longer term deposits with an original maturity of greater than three months.
iii Bank loans, loan notes and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the liabilities.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
iv Convertible bonds The convertible bonds are cash settled and are regarded as compound instruments consisting of a liability and a derivative instrument see policy below for derivatives.
Subsequent to initial recognition the conversion option is measured as a derivative financial instrument with the market value of the instrument at period end used as its fair value.
The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the liability component and this amount is carried as a long-term liability on the amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or redemption.
v Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments have historically been used to manage the risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations of the investment portfolio and changes in interest rates on its borrowings.
This is achieved by the use of foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the contract date and subsequently re-measured to the fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of currency swaps and interest rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash flows and current interest and exchange rates.
All changes in the fair value of financial instruments are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
Derivatives over own shares are classified as equity when they will be settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of shares for a fixed amount of cash.
vi Subordinated liabilities The Group has some limited recourse funding, which individually finances investment assets, at various fixed rates of interest and whose maturity is dependent upon the disposal of the associated assets.
This funding is subordinated to other creditors of the individual Group entity to which the funds have been advanced and becomes non-repayable as the assets fail.
These liabilities are held in the balance sheet at the amount expected to be repayable based on the underlying assets.
Changes in the amounts repayable as a result of changes in the underlying assets are treated as other income in the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest payable on subordinated liabilities is charged as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable.
3i Group plc Report and accounts 2010 Overview Business Case Risk Corporate Governance Financial Portfolio and review studies responsibility statements other information 97 J Employee benefits i Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged to the statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Current service costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.
A retirement benefit deficit is recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the present value of the defined benefit obligations exceeds the fair value of plan assets.
A retirement benefit surplus is recognised in the balance sheet where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligations limited to the extent that the Group can benefit from that surplus.
ii Share-based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the requirements of IFRS 2 have been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The costs of share-based payments made by the Company in respect of subsidiaries employees are treated as additional investments in those subsidiaries.
The Group enters into arrangements that are equity-settled share-based payments with certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 3i Group plc.
The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the period.
The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
K Other assets Assets, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated at their cost less impairment losses.
They are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows.
Any change in the level of impairment is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss is reversed at subsequent balance sheet dates to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed its carrying value had no impairment been recognised.
L Other liabilities Liabilities, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated based on the amounts which are considered to be payable in respect of goods or services received up to the balance sheet date.
M Share capital Ordinary shares issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds or fair value received with the excess of the amount received over nominal value being credited to the share premium account.
Direct issue costs net of tax are deducted from equity.
N Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made.
The provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value if the effect is material.
Changes in provisions are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the period.
O Income taxes Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax.
Tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
This may differ from the profit included in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit temporary differences, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Where there are taxable differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax liabilities are recognised except where the Group is able to control reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
However, where there are deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that both the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill and other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

It is estimated that Ernst & Young LLP receive less than 20% of the total investment-related fees paid to the four largest accounting firms.
Ernst & Young LLP also acts as auditor to the 3i Group Pension Plan.
The appointment of the auditors to this Plan and the fees paid in respect of the audit are agreed by the trustees who act independently from the management of the Group.

The features of the Groups share schemes are set out below.
For legal or regulatory reasons certain participants may be granted phantom awards under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without entitling the participant to acquire shares.
Share options i The 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan Options granted after 31 March 2001 were granted under the Discretionary Share Plan and are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant to the extent a performance target has been met over a performance period of three years from the date of grant.
For options granted between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2003 and for options granted to three Directors in June 2003, if the minimum threshold for vesting is not achieved in the first three years from grant, the performance period is extended to four and then five years from the date of grant.
For options granted between 1 April 2003 and 31 March 2004 the performance period is extended only to four years from the date of grant.
For options granted after 31 March 2004, there is no opportunity for the performance condition to be re-tested after the three-year performance period.
Options granted between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2003 were subject to a performance condition that options would vest if the annual compound growth ACG in net asset value per share with dividends re-invested was RPI plus 5%.
If this target was achieved then 50% of the options would vest.
If the ACG was in excess of RPI plus 10% then the maximum number of shares would vest.
Options would vest pro rata if the ACG was between these two amounts.
For options granted between 31 March 2003 and 1 April 2004 the target ACG was RPI plus 3% with maximum vesting at RPI plus 6%, except for options granted to three Directors in June 2003 where the target ACG was RPI plus 5% with maximum vesting at RPI plus 10%.
For options granted after 1 April 2005 the target ACG was RPI plus 3% with maximum vesting at RPI plus 8%.
ii The 3i Group 1994 Executive Share Option Plan Options granted before 31 March 2001 were granted under this Plan and are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant provided that a performance condition has been met over a rolling three-year period.
This requires that the adjusted net asset value per share with dividends re-invested at the end of the three-year period is equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share at the beginning of the period compounded annually over the period by the annual increase in the RPI plus 4%.
Details of share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2010 2010 2009 2009 Weighted Weighted average average Number of exercise price Number of exercise price 1 1 share options pence share options pence Outstanding at the start of the year 21,077,816 472 20,197,287 486 Granted 3,390,270 277 5,020,705 414 Exercised 1,980,794 412 Lapsed 6,689,584 468 2,159,382 534 Outstanding at the end of year 17,778,502 436 21,077,816 472 Exercisable at the end of year 7,434,393 445 11,906,040 444 1 Included within the total number of share options are options over 2 million 2009 : 3 million shares that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted on or before 7 November 2002.
1 Both the number of options and their respective share prices have been restated to reflect the 12 June 2009 rights issue using the adjustment factor of 0.6227.
Options are exercisable at a price based on the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
No options were exercised during the year.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise in 2009 was 872p.
The options outstanding at the end of the 1 year have a weighted average contractual life of 6.45 years 2009 : 6.33 years.
The cost of share options is spread over the vesting period of three to five years.
1 The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 124p 2009 : 241p.
These fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to this model were as follows: 1 2010 2009 Weighted average share price pence 268 636 Average expected volatility % 52 47 Expected life years 8.5 8.5 Average risk-free rate % 3.9 4.6 Average expected dividend yield % 2.4 3.6 1 The fair value of options and the assumptions for 2009 have not been adjusted for the rights issue.
The expected life of the option is based on the best estimate of the Directors following a review of the profile of the award holders.
Expected volatility was determined using an average of the implied volatility on grant and historic share price volatility of the preceding 8.5 years.
3i Group plc Report and accounts 2010 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 104 104 8 Share-based payments continued Performance Share awards Performance Share awards made under the 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan during the year were conditional awards of shares to executives which will be transferred to the participant by the 3i Group Employee Trust on vesting.
Awards are subject to a performance condition determining whether and to what extent the award will vest.
There are two types of awards: conditional Performance Share awards and conditional Super-performance Share awards.
The performance condition for Performance Share awards is based on the outperformance of the theoretical growth in value of a shareholding in the Company with dividends reinvested for the three year performance period from grant averaged over a 60 day period compared to the growth in value of the FTSE 100 Index with dividends reinvested adjusted for mergers, demergers and delistings over that period.
At an outperformance level below 0% per annum no part of the award will vest.
At an outperformance level of 0% per annum, 35% of the award will vest and above 8% per annum the full award will vest.
At outperformance levels between 0% and 8%, the award will vest on a pro rata basis.
Performance Share awards made before 1 April 2007 were restricted awards which vest based on the Companys percentage rank by total shareholder return for the three years from grant averaged over a 60 day period compared to a comparator group consisting of the FTSE 100 Index constituents at the grant date adjusted for mergers, demergers and delistings during the performance period.
A companys percentage rank is its rank in the comparator group divided by the number of companies in the group at the end of the performance period expressed as a percentage.
At a percentage rank below 50% no shares vest.
At a rank of 50%, 35% of the shares vest and at 75% all the shares vest.
Between these points shares vest pro rata.
Super-performance Share awards were conditional awards of shares which are subject to a particularly challenging performance condition.
The performance condition requires annual percentage compound growth in the net asset value per share with dividends re-invested over the three-year period of RPI plus 10 percentage points per annum to achieve minimum vesting of 25% of the award: RPI plus 13.5 percentage points per annum to achieve 50% vesting: and RPI plus 17 percentage points per annum to achieve maximum vesting.
The performance condition is measured over a three-year period.
If the condition is satisfied, the awards remain subject to a further two-year holding period before they vest.
Super-performance Share awards made before 1 April 2007 were restricted awards which were transferred to the participants by the 3i Group Employee Trust on terms that the shares would be forfeited to the extent the performance condition was not satisfied and in certain other circumstances.
Share Incentive Plan Eligible UK employees may participate in an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan intended to encourage employees to invest in the Companys shares.
Accordingly it is not subject to a performance condition.
During the year participants could invest up to 125 per month from their pre-tax salaries in the Companys shares referred to as partnership shares.
For each share so acquired the Company grants two free additional shares referred to as matching shares which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed other than by reason of retirement within three years of grant.
Dividends are re-invested on behalf of participants in further shares referred to as dividend shares.
Employee Share Investment Plan As part of the rights issue, eligible employees could subscribe to between 5,000 and 1.5 million of ordinary shares.
Employees would then be granted one matching share for every two ordinary shares purchased, which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed other than by reason of retirement within three years of grant.
The matching shares are also subject to the condition that fully diluted NAV per share grows by 35% or more between 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2012.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan Certain employees receive an element of their bonus as shares.
These shares are held in trust for two years by the trustee of the 3i Group Employee Trust in a nominee capacity.
The fair value of the deferred shares is the share price at date of the award.
Employee Trust The Group has established the 3i Group Employee Trust which holds shares in 3i Group plc to meet its obligations under certain share schemes.
The share schemes which use this trust are the 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan and the Deferred Bonus Share Plan.
9 Retirement benefit deficit Retirement benefit plans i Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group.
The employees of the Groups subsidiaries in France are members of a state-managed retirement benefit plan operated by the countrys government.
The French subsidiary is required to contribute a specific percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The total expense recognised in profit or loss is 3 million 2009: 5 million, which represents the contributions payable to these plans.
There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
ii Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK.
The plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006.
The plan will close to the future accrual of benefits by members with effect 5 April 2011, although the final salary link will be maintained on existing accruals.
Members of the plan have been invited to join the Groups defined contribution plan with effect from 5 April 2011.
The plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Companys finances and are administered by the trustees.
The last full actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2007 was updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2010.

For this reason the portfolio is classified as non-current.
It is not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions to loans and receivables includes 183 million 2009: 4 million interest received by way of loan notes.
A corresponding amount has been included in income from loans and receivables.
Other movements include foreign exchange and conversions from one instrument into another, and the impact of the solvent liquidation of 3i QPEP.
Included within the statement of comprehensive income are foreign exchange losses of 359 million 2009: 505 million gain.
This includes exchange movements on non-monetary items eg equity investment portfolio and on monetary items eg non-sterling loans and borrowings.
Of this, foreign exchange losses on monetary items not measured at fair value total 105 million 2009: 231million.
Fair value hierarchy The Group classifies financial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted from active markets Quoted equity instruments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments, variable funding note Unquoted equity instruments are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted equity instruments can be found in the section Portfolio valuation an explanation.
The variable funding note relating to the Debt Warehouse is included within the loans and receivables balance and at 31 March 2010 had a carrying value of 75 million 2009: nil.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy the variable funding note is classified as Level 3.
Within the year, the variable funding note had investment of 42 million, revaluation of 45 million and foreign exchange movements of 3 million.
The variable funding note also had interest income and fees of 10 million in the year.

Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
A reasonably possible alternative assumption would be to apply a standard marketability discount of 5% for all assets rather than the specific approach adopted.
This would have a positive impact on the portfolio of 94 million or 5% of total unquoted equity value.

References in this note to the Risk section refer only to the contents of that section and not to other information referred to from the Risk section.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management, crossreferring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to a risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, including cash held on deposit, and shareholders equity.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 19 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in note 26.
Capital is managed so as to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a capital base to allow the Group to operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.

Capital constraints The Group is generally free to transfer capital from subsidiary undertakings to the parent company subject to maintaining each subsidiary with sufficient reserves to meet local statutory obligations.
No significant constraints have been identified in the past and the Group has been able to distribute profits in a tax-efficient manner.
The Company operates so as to qualify as a UK Investment Trust for tax purposes which necessitates its investment in subsidiaries remaining below 15% of the Companys investment portfolio.
The Groups regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment firm that is regulated by the FSA.
The last submission to the FSA demonstrated a significant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FSAs prudential rules.
The Groups capital requirement is updated annually following approval of the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP report by the Board of 3i Investments plc.
The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with the FSA and remains at a significant regulatory capital surplus.

Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in note 1, segmental analysis.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with circa 45% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA Liquidity funds.
The balance is held on short-term deposit with 3is relationship banks.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due it is believed that the risk of default is small and that capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the Groups investment.
Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan.
Loan impairments are made when the valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases an appropriate loan impairment is recorded to reflect the valuation shortfall.
Further information on how credit risk is managed is given in the Risk section.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the amounts shown as past due represent the total credit exposure, not the amount actually past due.

The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small.
An increase of 100 basis points would lead to an approximate exposure of 4 million 2009: 5 million for the Group and 1 million 2009: 3 million for the Company.
This exposure arises principally from changes in interest payable and receivable on floating rate and short-term instruments and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives held at the year end.
In addition the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.

The Group is maintaining its policy of only using core currency borrowings to hedge the investment portfolio.
In previous years the contracts entered into by the Group were principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts was recorded in the balance sheet and was determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts were designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value were taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
At the balance sheet date there were no notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts: 2010 2009 m m Currency swaps 259 Forward foreign exchange contracts 198 457 Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Variable rate to fixed rate 605 634 Variable rate to variable rate 150 150 755 784 The Group does not trade in derivatives.
In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the statement of comprehensive income.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in note 13, derivative financial instruments are measured using Level 2 inputs.

3i Group plc Report and accounts 2010 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 122 12 2 28 Per share information On 28 April 2009, 3i Group plc acquired the assets of 3i Quoted Private Equity plc 3i QPEP through a solvent liquidation of the company.
The Group paid 110 million in cash and issued 37.6 million 3i Group shares to 3i QPEP shareholders in exchange for 220 million of cash and quoted assets with a value of 147 million.
The Group paid 50p in cash and 0.1706 of new 3i Group shares for each 3i QPEP share.
The earnings per share comparative has been adjusted by a rate of 0.98, being the ratio between the theoretical ex-transaction price and the closing share price prior to the transaction.
Through the rights issue on 12 June 2009, 3i Group plc issued 542 million new ordinary shares at 135p per new ordinary share on the basis of nine new ordinary shares for every seven ordinary shares held.
Prior period comparatives for EPS have been adjusted by a factor of 0.6227 to reflect the bonus element inherent in the rights issue.
The factor is calculated based on the pre-issue price of 410p, the price on the last day the shares traded cum-rights.
The NAV per share comparatives have been restated by adjusting the comparative NAV by the net assets and the number of shares relating to the 3i QPEP transaction, by 90 million and 37.6 million respectively.
The adjustment factor of 0.6227 has then been applied to this adjusted NAV per share to derive the restated figure.
The earnings and net assets per share attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company are based on the following data: 1 March 2010 March 2009 Earnings per share pence Basic 17.2 318.7 Diluted 17.1 318.7 Earnings m Profit Loss for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company 154 1,948 1 March 2010 March 2009 Weighted average number of shares in issue Ordinary shares 910,689,107 383,495,547 Own shares 16,310,231 10,465,956 894,378,876 373,029,591 Impact of rights issue bonus element and 3i QPEP bonus element 238,239,213 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares 2 Share options 5,026,956 Diluted shares 899,405,832 611,268,804 1 March 2010 March 2009 Net assets per share Basic 3.23 2.96 Diluted 3.21 2.94 Net assets m Net assets attributable to equity holders of the Company 3,068 1,862 1 Restated to reflect the impact of the bonus element of the rights issue and the solvent liquidation of 3i QPEP.
