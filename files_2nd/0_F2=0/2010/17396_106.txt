Share-based payments Long-Term Incentive Plans Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2006 onwards A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
There are different performance targets for different categories of management.
Awards made to executive directors and senior employees have 50% of the award subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts on the date of the award.
Full vesting of this portion of the award will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile and 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking, with pro rata vesting for intermediate performance.
No vesting will occur for a ranking below median.
The remaining 50% of the award made to executive directors and senior employees is subject to the Companys real growth in normalised earnings per share EPS over the performance period.
For the 2006 and subsequent awards the growth target required the increase to be more than 10% per annum above the UK Retail Price Index RPI in the three-year performance period to allow full vesting: if the increase is less than 4% per annum above the UK RPI then there will be no vesting.
A sliding scale operates between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI.
Awards made to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition.
As a general rule awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited.
In the event a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro rated entitlement.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following award, without interest.
Atkins Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2003 to August 2006 A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.

Full vesting of any award took place for a TSR performance where the Company ranked in the top 20% in a group of up to 16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for median ranking and no award if TSR fell below the median.
The EPS underpin was the UK RPI plus 2% per annum.
As a general rule awards made to participants who left employment prior to vesting were forfeited.
In the event that a participant left as a result of a qualifying reason they received a pro rated entitlement.
All awards have now vested.

A sliding scale in relation to the number of ordinary shares that could be acquired operated for growth in EPS between 5% and 12% above the UK RPI.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the award between vesting and exercise.

For the purposes of valuing LTIP awards with market performance conditions, the Monte Carlo model has been used to arrive at the sharebased payments charge.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2010 2009 LTIP LTIP Exercise price nil nil Risk-free interest rate n a n a Discount in respect of dividend yield 0% 0% Volatility of share price 39.8% 24.5% and 35.8% Share price at grant date: 27 06 2008 1,048.0p 1,048.0p 27 11 2008 611.0p 611.0p 19 06 2009 546.0p Expected term 3 years from 3 years from grant date grant date Volatility was determined based on the movement in the share price over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the period over which the TSR condition applies, which equates to a three-year share price history 2009: a three-year share price history.
The fair value of share plans involving market performance conditions takes into account market information.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, the Monte Carlo model simulates TSR for the Company and a comparator group.
In 2010 and 2009 the comparator group consisted of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The model takes into account historic dividends and share price volatilities for the Company and the comparator group to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
Awards that do not contain market performance conditions are valued at market value at date of award and discounted in the event that the award does not benefit from dividends during the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 528.06p 2009: 993.70p.
