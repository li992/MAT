ReinSURAnCe We maintain a conservative reinsurance programme to minimise volatility in earnings from large losses and catastrophe events.
For example, as the largest general insurer in Chile, the recent earthquake resulted in a gross loss of around 1.4bn, which was reduced to a 30m net loss through our extensive reinsurance programme.
ReSeRVing Our policy is to reserve to the right side of best estimate, so that more often than not reserves develop positively over time.
Our prudent approach can be seen in the sustained levels of prior year profits included in the underwriting result.

In addition to providing independent advice to the Committee, towers Watson provides broad reward and pensions advice to the Company.
Remuneration policy principles the Committees remuneration policy is consistent with the high performance culture across the Group.
the key principles which underpin the remuneration policy are that: total remuneration is set at a level which enables the recruitment, retention and motivation of high quality executive talent there is a strong and visible link between remuneration and performance executive remuneration and shareholder interests are strongly aligned.
this is reflected in the design of the LtIp which provides a co-investment opportunity the observation of existing share ownership guidelines further enhances the alignment of executive Directors with those of shareholders interests Incentive arrangements are leveraged so that only exceptional performance attracts the highest levels of award a balance of short and long term performance is used, incorporating measures of financial performance, profitable growth, delivery of shareholder value and a robust assessment of personal contribution remuneration policy and practice is transparent to shareholders Where relevant, there is consideration of environmental, governance and social risks when determining remuneration for executive Directors and senior managers to ensure that positive and appropriate behaviours are reinforced.
the policies relating to each element of remuneration are set out in the remuneration policy summary table below.
Remuneration policy summary element of remuneration policy Base salary Base salary is set with reference to equivalent roles in similar companies and the sustained performance of the executive.
annual performance bonus Bonus payments are related to stretching performance targets and are capped at 180% of base salary.
For maximum bonuses to be achieved outstanding performance must be demonstrated.
Share based long term incentive to provide annual share awards to executives to ensure alignment with shareholder interests awards solely through the LtIp.
other than in exceptional circumstances, no other discretionary share plan will be used to make awards.

50 | RSA | annual review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 Corporate GovernanCe Share based long term incentive awards prior to the approval of the LtIp, two long term share incentive plans were in place: the 2004 Share Matching plan, which was designed to operate for two years.
the final awards under this plan were made in 2005 the executive Share option Scheme 1999 eSoS.
regular awards under the 1999 eSoS were discontinued from 2006 and the scheme expired in 2009. a renewed executive Share option Scheme new eSoS was adopted by the Company and approved by shareholders at the 2009 aGM.
as with the 1999 eSoS, it is intended that the new plan will initially be used only in exceptional circumstances, such as executive recruitment.
performance conditions will attach to all options granted under the new eSoS and will be determined by the Committee at the appropriate time.
to date no grants have been made under the new eSoS.
ltip the primary long term incentive is the LtIp, the key features of which and associated policies are summarised in the sections below.
awards under the LtIp will be funded through a combination of new issues and shares purchased in the market.
conditional awards of performance Shares participants may receive a conditional award of shares with the grant level and performance condition determined by the Committee prior to each grant performance Shares.
executive Directors, members of the executive team and the top 100 executives in the Group top 100 will be eligible for awards of performance Shares.
In 2011, awards of performance Shares to executive Directors and the executive team will be limited to a maximum face value of 150% of base salary, other than in exceptional circumstances.
account will be taken of personal performance in determining the scale of the award to each executive Director and members of the executive team.
For executives below this level, awards are made based on a formula which relates the size of award to performance and potential, as measured through the annual performance appraisal process.
In any year, the face value of performance Shares granted to any individual will be limited to 150% of base salary in normal circumstances subject to an overriding cap of 250% of base salary in exceptional circumstances such as an executive recruitment.
performance Shares will vest after three years subject to performance conditions see below and provided the individual remains in employment with the Group other than in exceptional circumstances such as death or retirement at normal retirement age.
Deferred Shares Members of the executive team and the top 100 may be granted deferred share awards as part of the annual bonus compulsory Deferred Shares.
these Deferred Shares may not be withdrawn and will normally vest three years from the date of grant subject to continued employment with the Group.
In addition executives may invest an additional portion of bonus in Deferred Shares on a voluntary basis voluntary Deferred Shares.
voluntary Deferred Shares are not at risk of forfeiture and may be withdrawn at any time but the right to Matching Shares would lapse on those Deferred Shares withdrawn.
conditional awards of matching Shares executives may receive a conditional award of matching shares pro rata to the number of Deferred Shares held Matching Shares.
at threshold performance the matching ratio will be 0.625:1. the maximum matching ratio for Matching Shares: Deferred Shares will be 2.5:1, calculated on the gross value of the bonus invested in Deferred Shares.
Details of the performance condition used are set out below.
executive Directors, members of the executive team and the top 100 will be eligible for awards of Matching Shares.
Matching Shares will vest after three years subject to performance conditions see below and provided the individual remains in employment with the Group other than in exceptional circumstances such as death or retirement at normal retirement age.
performance conditions the Committee will determine the performance condition for each grant of performance Shares and Matching Shares, with performance measured over a single period of three years with no provision to retest.
In 2011 grants of performance Shares and Matching Shares related to compulsory Deferred Shares will be subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of roe and tSr targets.
roe has been selected as the measure of financial performance as it is one of the key measures of overall business performance and is visible externally to shareholders.
annual review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 | RSA | 51 RemuneRAtion RepoRt continueD the tSr performance condition has been designed to provide alignment between executive remuneration and shareholder interests and to ensure that an element of the package is linked directly to share price performance.
the comparator group has been selected to ensure that performance is compared fairly against a group of similar companies operating in a similar competitive environment.
the use of roe and tSr in combination provides a balanced approach to the measurement of Company performance over the longer term.
as in 2010 roe will be given greater prominence than relative tSr, to underline our commitment to improving the returns that we generate on our balance sheet.
the vesting of 70% of the LtIp awards will be based on reported roe performance and 30% on relative tSr performance with the exception of Matching Shares attaching to voluntary Deferred Shares, the vesting of which will remain dependent solely on the roe performance condition.
70% of the shares comprising the award will vest according to roe performance.
For awards made in 2010, the roe target range was 10% to 16%.
the range of roe performance targets has varied from year to year, and for performance periods yet to conclude is summarised below: year of grant Range start Range end 2008 12% 18% 2009 10% 16% 2010 10% 16% range to be applied in 2011 10% 16% For awards made in 2010, the roe performance scale is: underlying average annual Roe proportion of this part of the award vesting Below 10% 0% 10% 25% 16% 100% Between 10% and 16% Between 25% and 100% pro rata 30% of the shares comprising the award will vest according to tSr performance against a comparator group of UK and international financial services companies as shown below.
For awards made in 2010, the tSr performance scale is: companys tSR performance proportion of this part of the award vesting Below median 0% Median 25% Upper quintile top 20% 100% Between median and upper quintile Between 25% and 100% pro rata additionally, before any shares subject to the tSr condition vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the Companys tSr performance is reflective of underlying financial performance.
the tSr comparator group consists of the following companies: tSR comparator group aegon allianz aXa avIva Baloise Generali Legal & General Munich re QBe Swiss re Zurich Financial Services 52 | RSA | annual review and Summary Financial Statements 2010 Corporate GovernanCe the Committee reviews, on an ongoing basis, the composition of the comparator group and will consider adding companies for future awards in the event that the number of constituent companies drops below an acceptable level.
the tSr condition is independently calculated and verified by the Committee for each award that vests.
the vesting of Matching Shares related to voluntary Deferred Shares will be determined solely by the roe performance condition.
Share ownership guidelines Strengthened share ownership guidelines were introduced in 2004 for executive Directors and members of the executive team.
the Group Ceo is required to maintain a minimum shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of base salary.
the other executive Directors have a target of 150% of base salary and other members of the executive team have a target of 75% of base salary.
In order to ensure that progress is made towards this target, executives are required to retain shares to a value of 50% of the net of tax gain under all executive schemes until the relevant guideline is attained.
this requirement will apply to awards under the LtIp and will continue to apply to awards under all existing long term incentive plans.

Matching Share awards are capable of vesting in respect of a maximum of three times the number of Deferred Shares awarded, subject to the achievement of tSr targets over a single two year period.
tSr performance is measured relative to other companies specified by the remuneration Committee.
For awards granted in 2004 and 2005, tSr was measured partly relative to FtSe 100 companies and partly relative to the following financial services comparator group companies: aegon, Legal & General Group, allianz Group, old Mutual, aXa, prudential, avIva, raS, Generali and Zurich Financial Services Group.
For 50% of the Matching Share awards, where tSr is measured against the FtSe 100, full vesting will only occur at upper decile performance, vesting will occur in the ratio of shares under Matching Share awards to shares under Deferred Share awards of 2:1 at upper quartile performance and vesting in the ratio 1:1 will occur at median performance.
For the other 50% of the Matching Share awards, where tSr is measured against the financial services comparator group, full vesting will occur if tSr is highest in the comparator group, vesting in the ratio 2:1 will occur at upper quartile performance and vesting in the ratio 1:1 will occur at median performance.
Matching Share awards will not vest at below median performance.
For awards granted in 2005, the targets were measured over the period from 1 april 2005 to 31 March 2007. the relevant tSr figures were averaged over the three months before the beginning and end of this performance period.
additionally, no Matching Shares vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period.
3. the aggregate gain on Share Matching plan awards exercised during 2010 was 146k.
Deferred Shares are inclusive of voluntary Deferred Shares and compulsory Deferred Shares.
voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by Capita trustees Limited on behalf of each participant using part of the net annual bonus paid to them and are held in trust for three years.
these Deferred Shares are not at risk of forfeiture and may be withdrawn from the trust at any time, but the related Matching Share awards would lapse if the voluntary Deferred Shares are withdrawn within three years of acquisition.
Compulsory Deferred Share awards are granted as part of the annual bonus.
these Deferred Shares will normally vest in three years from the date of grant subject to continuous employment with the Group.
Matching Shares are capable of vesting in respect of a maximum of 2.5 times the number of Deferred Shares awarded, subject to the achievement of performance conditions over a three year period.
For grants awarded in 2009 and 2010, 30% of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to tSr performance relative to other companies specified by the remuneration Committee.
For grants awarded in 2007 and 2008, 50% of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to tSr performance relative to other companies specified by the remuneration Committee and for awards granted in 2009 this was 30%.
Full vesting will only occur at upper quintile performance: at median performance 25% of the Matching Shares will vest.
vesting will be on a straight line basis in between.
the remaining balance of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares and all of the Matching Shares relating to voluntary Deferred Shares are subject to a roe performance condition.
If underlying roe over three years commencing in the year of grant is below 10% 12% for awards granted in 2008, no part of the award subject to roe performance will vest.
If underlying roe over three years is 10% 12% for awards granted in 2008, 25% of the award will vest.
If underlying average annual roe over three years is 16% or higher 18% for awards granted in 2008, 100% of the awards will vest.
For the purpose of establishing the number of Matching Shares relating to voluntary Deferred Shares that may be awarded, the gross value of that part of the annual bonus payment that a participant elects to voluntarily defer is used.
4. performance conditions relating to awards of performance Shares are the same as those relating to compulsory Deferred Matching Shares for the relevant year of grant as described above.
5. the date by which qualifying conditions for LtIp awards must be met is as follows: year of grant Date by which qualifying conditions must be fulfilled 2007 31.12.09 2008 31.12.10 2009 31.12.11 2010 31.12.12 6 the market price on the date of grant of awards 16 april 2007 was 164.6p, the market price on date of vesting of awards 8 March 2010 was 124.5p.
