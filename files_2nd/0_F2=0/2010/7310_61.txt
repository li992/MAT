The Company remains the operator with a 75% working interest in the Miran Block and has received the pro rata share of 25% of all past work programme expenditures and the third party pays its share of future costs.
The transaction was completed upon the receipt of approximately $6.7 million in costs incurred by the Group to 31 January 2009.
