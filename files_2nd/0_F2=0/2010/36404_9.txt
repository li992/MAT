Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2010 26 Our financial position Financial results The Groups financial results have benefited from an improvement in the property market environment since summer 2009 and the positive effect of various acquisitions made in the second half of the year.
Adjusted profits and earnings were up year on year mainly due to higher rental income and reduced interest expense.
Net asset value The opening value of adjusted net assets per share at 31 March 2009 has been restated to take into account the effects of the 166.4 million Rights Issue which completed in June 2009.
This 283p produces a pro forma net asset value of 245 pence at 31 March 2009 from which there has been adjusted net a rise of 15.5% in the year to 283 pence, largely because of upward movement in the value of assets per share the property portfolio.
At 31 March 2010, the Groups net assets were 876.7 million, up from 568.6 million at 31 March 2009 as a consequence of valuation gains and the Rights Issue.

Triple net assets per share NNNAV was 291 pence per share at 31 March 2010 compared to 251 pence per share at 31 March 2009 up15.9%.
At year end the difference between adjusted net assets per share and NNNAV was the positive mark to market of debt of 8 pence mainly arising from the low interest rate of the Groups 2029 debenture.

Including our share of joint venture rental income, total Group revenue was 68.5 million, down 1% on the year.
Rental income was marginally higher than last year due to recent acquisitions and the effect of rent reviews, lease renewals and new lettings.
Management fees from the Groups joint ventures were down 36.2% on last year, as a result of reduced transactional and development activity at The Great Wigmore Partnership GWP, The Great Victoria Partnership No2 GVP2 and GCP.
Property costs for the wholly-owned properties fell to 4.0 million 2009: 4.8 million as a consequence of a year on year decline in marketing and leasing expenses.
Administration costs were 0.2 million down on last year at 12.6 million as lower fixed overhead expenses and cash bonuses more than offset higher provisions for share incentive schemes.
Development management profits of 0.1 million compared to 4.0 million of profit from the Tooley Street project last year.
Adjusted profits from joint ventures excluding valuation movements and gains losses on property sales were 8.2 million, down from 9.2 million on last year, mainly due to the disposals of 208 222 Regent Street, W1 and 180 Great Portland Street, W1 in 2008 and Spirella House, W1 in 2009 which reduced rental income this year versus last year.
Underlying net finance costs were 44.2% lower at 11.6 million due to the repayment of debt at the Group level following the Rights Issue, property disposals and the termination of interest rate derivatives.
We have recorded a one-off accounting charge of 11.6 million in the income statement in respect of the costs of terminating the derivatives following guidance within IAS 39 see note 5 to the financial statements.
The IAS 39 accounting charge does not affect adjusted profits or adjusted earnings per share.
1p Adjusted earnings per share were 10.1 pence, 11.0% higher than last year mainly driven by increased adjusted PBT, described above.
EPS has been calculated using the weighted average adjusted earnings number of shares of 281.9 million and the 2009 comparative has been adjusted by the bonus factor per share from the Rights Issue to allow a direct comparison.
Revaluation gains and solid underlying profits caused the Group to report an accounting profit after tax of 156.4 million 2009: 436.1 million loss.
Basic EPS for the year was 55.5 pence, compared to a restated loss of 180.0 pence for 2009.

The Groups net investment in joint ventures was 332.4 million, substantially greater than the comparative at 31 March 2009 of 183.2 million, due to the creation of the Marcol House joint venture, The 100 Bishopsgate Partnership, acquisitions in GRP and GCP and valuation rises.

Group consolidated net debt was 232.6 million at 31 March 2010 down from 371.0 million a year earlier as a consequence of the Rights Issue and operational cash flow.
The Group invested 103.4 million in acquisitions, before development expenditure on Marcol House, 289 295 Regent Street, W1 and 23 24 Newman Street, W1.
Disposals of properties including the creation of The 100 Bishopsgate Partnership generated 140.5 million in net proceeds.
Group gearing fell significantly to 26.5% at 31 March 2010 from Financial covenants P91k 65.2% at 31 March 2009 as lower debt levels combined with the portfolio valuation rise.

We expect the gearing ratio to be around 5070% as this programme of investment completes.

Annual review Governance Financials 29 Cash collection and tenant delinquencies The quarterly cash collection profile was broadly similar throughout the year to March 2010.
We secured 93% of rent within seven working days following the March 2010 quarter day, which was slightly worse than March 2009 as the number of tenants on monthly payment terms increased to 4.4% of our rent roll.
Four of our tenants went into administration around the March 2010 quarter day, the largest being a shoe retailer with a unit on Oxford Street, creating arrears at the year end of around 0.47% of rent roll March 2009: four tenants, 0.01% of rent roll.
Taxation The tax provision on the income statement for the year is only 0.2 million 2009: 0.1million credit as a result of the tax free nature of much of the Groups income and other allowances being available to set against non-REIT profits.
The low level of taxable profits for the year meant the Groups underlying effective tax rate was around 1% 2009: minus1%.
The Group complied with all relevant REIT tests for the year to 31 March 2010. Dividend The Board has declared two interim dividends totalling 8.0 pence per share 2009: 9.0 pence on a 25m pro forma basis which were paid in January and April 2010.

co. uk investors reits Outlook Londons property investment recovery gathered pace over the past six months, supported by the significant volume of capital competing for a limited number of assets.
For the recent rise in capital values to be sustainable, further growth in rental values is important and, helpfully, conditions are improving at the prime end of the London office leasing market.
We are also seeing encouraging signs of life across the broader leasing market and, absent an economic setback, we expect office rents to rise selectively during the second half of 2010.
Great Portland Estates is in good shape.
We have navigated our way through the depths of the global financial crisis and emerged in an enviably strong market position.
In particular, we reduced our development exposure ahead of the storm, degeared the balance sheet through sales and raised capital to exploit weak market conditions, all of which is now committed in new opportunities.
Today, with a supportive medium-term market outlook, we have started to deliver one of Londons most exciting development programmes and, with one of the lowest gearing levels of all listed property companies, we have ample financial firepower both to finance our development aspirations and make the most of acquisition opportunities as we find them.
These attributes, along with our high quality assets and motivated team, all support our expectation of future outperformance from Great Portland Estates.
