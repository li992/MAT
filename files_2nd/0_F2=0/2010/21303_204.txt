There were no additional reclassications of financial assets during 2010.
The carrying value of the securities previously reclassied into loans and receivables has decreased from 9,378m to 8,625m as a result of sales, paydowns and maturities of the underlying securities, offset by foreign exchange movements and increases due to reversal of the discount on reclassication.
