In this event, the interest rate payable on the notes and the spread applicable to the oating notes will be increased by 0.25% for each ratings category adjustment by each rating agency.
In addition, if Moodys or S&P subsequently increase the ratings ascribed to the groups senior unsecured debt, then the interest rate then payable on notes and the spread applicable to the oating notes will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency, but in no event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum interest rate reected in the above table.
In February 2010, S&P downgraded BTs credit rating by one ratings category to BBB as detailed on page 138.
At the next coupon date in the 2011 financial year, the rate payable on these bonds will therefore increase by 0.25 percentage points.
