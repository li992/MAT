G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 75 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements 1 General information G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated fi financial statements incorporate the fi financial statements of the company and entities its subsidiaries controlled by the company collectively comprising the group and the groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities made up to 31 December each year.
The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6 and within the Business Review on pages 10 to 39 and 44 to 49.
The group operates throughout the world and in a wide range of functional currencies, the most signifi cant being the euro, the US dollar and sterling.
The groups fi financial statements are presented in sterling, as the groups primarylisting is in the UK.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The address of the registered offi ce is given onpage 132.
2 Statement of compliance The consolidated fi financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use intheEuropean Union adopted IFRSs.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company fi financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 116 to 124.
3 Signifi cant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated fi financial statements of the group have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and fi financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a signifi cant effect on the fi financial statements, and estimates with a signifi cant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4.
Further information on the going concern assessment is given in the Financial Review on pages 44 to 49 and innote33 on pages 101 to 103.
The comparative consolidated statement of fi financial position as at 31 December 2009 has been restated to refl ect the completion during 2010 of the initial accounting in respect of acquisitions made during 2009.
Adjustments made to the provisional calculation of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amount to 5m, with an equivalent increase in the reported value of goodwill.
The impact of these adjustments on the net assets acquired is presented in note 17.
The presentation of the consolidated fi financial statements has been changed to round results to the nearest 1m whereas previously they were rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Thischange has required the 2009 fi gures to be restated and as a result there are some immaterial inconsistencies between the restated rounded 2009 fi gures in the 2010 accounts compared to the same fi gures disclosed to the nearest 0.1m in the 2009 accounts.
In addition there may be immaterial  between the notes to the accounts and the primary statements for the 2009 fi gures.
b Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
Control is achieved where the group has the power to govern the fi financial and operating policies ofaninvestee entity so as to obtain benefi ts from its activities, determined either by the groups ownership percentage, or by the terms of any shareholder agreement.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The cost ofacquisition is measured as the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred to the vendor and does not include transaction costs.
The cost of acquisition in respect of acquisitions made prior to 1 January 2010 included transaction costs and has not been restated.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifi able net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any defi ciency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifi able net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the year of acquisition.
The cost of acquisition includes the present value of deferred consideration payable, including that in respect of put options held by non-controlling shareholders, as estimated at the date of acquisition.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010 subsequent changes to the present value of the estimate of contingent consideration and any difference upon fi final settlement of such a liability are recognised as adjustments to the cost of acquisition.
For acquisitions after 1 January 2010 such changes are recognised in the income statement.
Non-controlling interests are stated at their proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Profi ts and losses are applied in the proportion of their respective ownership to the interest of the parent and to the non-controlling interest.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of control orupto the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, in that strategic, fi financial and operating decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties.
The groups interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the groups share of the results and assets and liabilities of a jointly-controlled entity is combined line by line with similar items in the groups consolidated fi financial statements.
Associates An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise signifi cant infl uence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the fi financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the groups consolidated fi financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of fi financial position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the groups share ofthe net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a group company transacts with a joint venture or associate of the group, profi ts and losses are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the relevant joint venture or associate.
Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Business review Overview 76 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 3 Signifi cant accounting policies continued c Foreign currencies The fi financial statements of each of the groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance a part of the groups net investment in foreign operations, and on borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, where and to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective.
On disposal, translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
d Derivative fi financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the group only holds or issues derivative fi financial instruments to manage the groups exposure to fi financial risk, not for trading purposes.
Such fi financial risk includes the interest risk on the groups variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the groups fi xed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the groups results and on the translation of the groups net assets measured in foreign currencies.
The group manages these risks through a range of derivative fi financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fi xed rate agreements, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Derivative fi financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of fi financial position as fi financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
Fair value is measured using one of the valuation techniques based on one of the three following valuation hierarchies as set out in IFRS 7 Amended : Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below.
Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash fl ow hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash fl ow impacts the income statement.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Net investment hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged net investment impacts the income statement.
e Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the acquisition method.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the costofacquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifi able assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
No goodwill arises on the acquisition of an additional interest from a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary as this isaccounted for as an equity transaction.
Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses, and is tested annually for impairment or morefrequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included within the netinvestment in associates.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profi t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profi t or loss on disposal.
Acquisition-related intangible assets Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships.
The fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method.
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life.
The directors review acquisition-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Trademarks up to a maximum of fi five years Customer contracts and customer relationships up to a maximum of ten years Technology up to a maximum of fi five years G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 77 3 Signifi cant accounting policies continued e Intangible assets continued Other intangible assets development expenditure Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group.
Such expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identifi able asset, its cost can be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benefi ts, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has suffi cient resources to complete development.
In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the income statement.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, up to a maximum often years.
The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets software Computer software is capitalised as an intangible asset if such expenditure both internally generated and externally purchased creates an identifi able asset, if its cost can be measured reliably and if it is probable that it will generate future economic benefi ts.
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is charged on software so as to write-off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives up to a maximum of eight years.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 50 years Short leasehold buildings under 50 years over the life of the lease Equipment and motor vehicles one to ten years Assets held under fi finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Where signifi cant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually.
The directors review the carrying value of property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
g Financial instruments Financial assets and fi financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.
The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
The group provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that are past due in accordance with local conditions and past default experience.
Service concession assets Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative PFI or similar project the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset remain largely with the purchaser of theassociated services.
In such cases, the groups interest in the asset is classifi ed as a fi financial asset and included at its discounted value within trade and other receivables, to the extent to which the group has an unconditional right to receive cash from the grantor of the concession for the construction of the asset.
To the extent that the group has the right to charge for the use of such an asset, conditional upon the extent of the use, the group recognises an intangible asset.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in securities, which are classifi ed as held-for-trading.
They are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash fl ow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, includingpremiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using theeffective interest method.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
h Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads.
Cost is calculated using either the weighted average or the fi first-infi first-out method.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision ismade for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Business review Overview 78 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 3 Signifi cant accounting policies continued i Impairment The carrying value of the groups assets, with the exception of inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication ofimpairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value in use, where value in use is assessed as the estimated pre-tax future cash fl ows deriving from the asset discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate which refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash fl ows, the recoverable amount is determined with respect to the cash-generating unit to which the asset attaches.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested annually through assessing the carrying values of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill attaches.
Animpairment loss recognised in respect of a cash-generating unit is allocated fi first so as to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying value of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount.
The amount of the reversal is limited such that the assets carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined after depreciation and amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised.
j Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Where repurchased shares are held by an employee benefi t trust, they are classifi ed as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from equity.
k Employee benefi ts Retirement benefi t costs Payments to defi ned contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefi t schemes are dealt with as payments to defi ned contribution schemes where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defi ned contribution retirement benefi ts scheme.
For defi ned benefi t schemes, the cost of providing benefi ts is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried outat each balance sheet date.
The discount rate used is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The expected fi finance income on assets and the fi finance cost on liabilities are recognised in the income statement as components of fi finance income and fi finance cost respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and presented outside the income statement in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefi ts are already vested.
Otherwise it is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefi ts vest.
Changes to the value of accrued benefi ts arising from government action are accounted for as changes in actuarial assumptions following the guidance issued by the UK ASB in UITF 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the Retail Prices Index with the Consumer Prices Index for Retirement Benefi ts.
The retirement benefi t obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of fi financial position represents the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Long-term service benefi ts The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefi ts other than retirement benefi ts represents the present value of the future benefi t that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Share-based payments The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant andexpensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
l Provisions Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of theobligation can be estimated reliably.
Items within provisions include onerous loss-making contracts, external claims against the groups captive insurance businesses, costs of meeting lease requirements on unoccupied properties, costs of replacing assets where there is a present contractual obligation and restructuring provisions for the costs of a business reorganisation where the plans are suffi ciently detailed and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate discount rate.
m Revenue recognition Revenue Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue for manned security and cash solutions products and for recurring services in security systems products is recognised to refl ect the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue on security systems installations isrecognised either on completion in respect of product sales, or in accordance with the stage of completion method in respect of construction contracts.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 79 3 Signifi cant accounting policies continued m Revenue recognition continued Construction contracts Where signifi cant, security system installations with a contract duration in excess of one month are accounted for as construction contracts.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred.
Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Construction contracts are recognised on the consolidated statement of fi financial position at cost plus profi t recognised to date, less provision for foreseeable losses and less progress billings.
Government grants Government grants in respect of items expensed in the income statement are recognised as deductions from the associated expenditure.
Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the lives of the related assets.
Interest Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
This is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the fi financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
n Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
o Profi t from operations Profi t from operations is stated after the share of results of associates but before fi finance income and fi finance costs.
Exceptional items of particular signifi cance, including restructuring costs, are included within profi t from operations but are disclosed separately.
p Income taxes Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profi t for the year.
Taxable profi t differs from net profi t as reported in the income statement because it excludes items ofincome or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability forcurrent tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated fi financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profi t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profi ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profi t nor the accounting profi t. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of each deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suffi cient taxable profi ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
q Leasing Leases are classifi ed as fi finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classifi ed as operating leases.
This classifi cation can be a matter of fi ne judgement.
Assets held under fi finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of fi financial position as a fi finance lease obligation.
Amounts due from lessees under fi finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the groups net investment in the leases.
Lease payments made or received are apportioned between fi finance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset.
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as are incentives to enter into operating leases.
r Operating segments An operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the groups other components.
All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the groups CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete fi financial information is available.
Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Business review Overview 80 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 3 Signifi cant accounting policies continued s Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classifi ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classifi cation.
A discontinued operation is a component of the groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is asubsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classifi ed as held for sale.
t Dividend distribution Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid or approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
u Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
The following revisions to IFRS will be applicable in future periods, subject to endorsement where applicable: k Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures is applicable for 2011.
This standard amends the defi nition of related parties and modifi es certain disclosures.
k Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures are applicable for 2011.
The amendments state that qualitative disclosures should be made in the context of the quantitative disclosures to better enable users to evaluate an entitys exposure to risks arising from fi financial instruments.
k Amendments to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defi ned Benefi t Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction is applicable for 2011.
These amendments remove consequences arising from the treatment of prepayments where there is a minimum funding requirement.
k Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements are applicable for 2011.
The amendments clarify that disaggregation of changes in each component of equity arising from transactions recognised in other comprehensive income also is required to be presented, but may be presented either inthe statement of changes in equity or in the notes.
The group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a signifi cant impact on the fi financial statements.
4 Accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of fi financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date ofthefi financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the fi financial statements and the reported amounts of income andexpenses during the reporting period.
These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial techniques.
Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most signifi cance to the group are detailed below: Valuation of acquired businesses The initial accounting for an acquisition involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to identifi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as well as the acquisition cost.
In some instances, this initial accounting can only be determined provisionally by the end of the period in which the acquisition is effected because the fair values and or the cost is not known with full certainty.
In such an event, the initial accounting can be completed using provisional values with any adjustments to those provisional values being completed within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Additionally, in determining the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets, in the absence of market prices for similar assets, valuation techniques are applied.
These techniques use a variety of estimates including projected future results and expected future cash fl ows, discounted using the weighted average cost of capital relevant to the acquisition.
Furthermore, management make an assessment of the useful economic life of acquired intangible assets upon recognition.
Full details of the fair values of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are presented in note 17.
Assessment of the recoverable amounts in respect of assets tested for impairment The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
The impairment analysis for such assets is based principally upon discounted estimated future cash fl ows from the use and eventual disposal of the assets.
Such an analysis includes an estimation of the future anticipated results and cash fl ows, annual growth rates and the appropriate discount rates.
The full methodology and results of the groups impairment testing is presented in note 19.
Valuation of retirement benefi t obligations The valuation of defi ned retirement benefi t schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualifi ed independent actuaries who use the projected unit credit method for determining the groups obligations.
This methodology requires the use of a variety of assumptions and estimates, including the appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and infl ation.
Full details ofthe groups retirement benefi t obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key assumptions are presented in note 34.

The amount of deferred consideration which will be paid is in part dependent upon the future performance of the acquired businesses.
The maximum undiscounted amount of deferred consideration which could be payable is 32m.
Adjustments made to identifi able assets and liabilities on acquisition are to refl ect their fair value.
These include the recognition of customer-related intangibleassets amounting to 13m.
The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and represent estimates following a preliminary valuation exercise.
These estimates may be adjusted to refl ect any development in the issues to which they relate.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce, developed expertise and processes and the opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the business.
Neither of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separable from goodwill.

Customer-related intangibles comprise the contractual and other relationships with customers which meet the criteria for identifi cation as intangible assets in accordance with IFRS.
Customer contracts and relationships recognised upon the acquisition of Securicor plc on 19 July 2004 are considered signifi cant to the group.
The carrying amount at 31 December 2010 was 72m 2009: 96m, and the amortisation period remaining in respect of these assets is three and a half years.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs which are expected to benefi t from that business combination.
The majority of goodwill was generated by the merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 2004 which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck.
The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
The annual impairment test is performed prior to the year end when the budgeting process is fi nalised and reviewed post-year end.
Thegroups impairment test compares the carrying value of each CGU to its recoverable amount.
CGUs are identifi ed on a country level basis including signifi cant business units, as per the groups detailed management accounts.
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value.
Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Business review Overview 94 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 19 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash fl ow calculations.
These calculations include forecast pre-tax cash fl ows for a period of fi five years.
The fi five year cash fl ow forecasts are based on the budget for the following year year one and the business plans for years two and three, the results of which are reviewed by the board, and projections for years four and fi five, all of which refl ect past experience as well as future expected market trends.
Budgeted and forecast cash fl ows are based on managements assessment of current contract portfolio, contract wins, contract retention and price increases.
Cash fl ows beyond the fi five year forecast period are projected into perpetuity at the lower ofthe planned growth rate in year three and the forecast underlying economic growth rate for the economies in which the CGU operates.
Where the planned growth rate in year three exceeds the forecast underlying economic growth rate, the excess is reduced progressively in the projections for years four and fi five.
Growth rates across the groups CGUs range from 0% to 20%, and the into-perpetuity growth rates for the signifi cant CGUs are disclosed in the table below.
Future cash fl ows are discounted at a pre-tax, weighted average cost of capital which for the group is 6.5% 2009: 8.4%, and thediscount rates for the signifi cant CGUs are disclosed in the table below.
Pre-tax cash fl ows are discounted using pre-tax discount rates derived from calculating the net present value of the post-tax cash fl ows discounted at post-tax rates.
The group rate is adjusted where appropriate to refl ect the different fi financial risks in each country in which the CGUs operate.
Risk-adjusted discount rates applicable to group entities range from 4.7% in Singapore to 38.4% inZambia.
In applying the groups model, no impairment has been identifi ed and recognised in any of the groups CGUs for the year ended 31 December 2010 or fortheyear ended 31 December 2009.
Management believe that there is currently no reasonably possible change in the underlying factors used in the impairment model which would lead to a material impairment of goodwill.
The following CGUs have signifi cant carrying amounts of goodwill: Goodwill Goodwill Discount rate Discount rate Growth rate Growth rate 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m US secure solutions manned security 6.4% 7.2% 2.5% 2.5% 372 359 Former GSL business acquired in 2008 6.5% 8.4% 2.5% 2.5% 258 258 UK cash solutions 6.5% 8.4% 2.5% 2.5% 239 241 Netherlands security solutions 6.0% 7.3% 3.3% 3.5% 121 126 UK secure solutions manned security 6.5% 8.4% 2.5% 2.5% 117 117 UK secure solutions justice services 6.5% 8.4% 2.5% 2.5% 95 95 Estonia secure solutions and cash solutions 7.0% 13.1% 4.0% 4.0% 65 67 Other all allocated 880 786 Total goodwill 2,147 2,049 Growth rate is the long term into-perpetuity growth rate.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash fl ow calculations relate to the discount rates and underlying economic growth rates for each CGU.
With all other variables being equal, a 1% increase in the group discount rate from 6.5% to 7.5% with equivalent increases to the discount rates in all countries would result in a goodwill impairment to the group of 5m.
A signifi cant increase of 3% in the group discount rate from 6.5% to 9.5%, and an equivalent increase in all countries, would result in a group impairment of 18m.
A decrease in the underlying growth rate in all countries of 1% would result in a group impairment of 3m.
A decrease of 3% in growth rate would result in agroup impairment of 12m.
These approximations indicate the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the underlying assumptions.
However, it is highly unlikely that any variations in the assumptions would impact on all CGUs at the same time.

Group companies are required to follow the Group Finance Manual guidelines with respect to assessing the credit worthiness of potential customers.
These guidelines include processes such as obtaining approval for credit limits over a set amount, performing credit checks and assessments and obtaining additional security where required.
Credit terms vary across the group and can range from 0 to 90 days to refl ect the different risks within each country in which the group operates.
There is no group-wide rate of provision, and provision is made for debts that are past due according to local conditions and past default experience.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is as follows: 2010 2009 m m At 1 January 66 59 Amounts written off during the year 5 8 Increase in allowance 12 15 At 31 December 73 66 Included within trade receivables are trade debtors with a carrying amount of 393m 2009: 368m which are past due at the reporting date for which noprovision has been made as there has not been a signifi cant change in credit quality and the group believes that the amounts are still recoverable.
Thegroup does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The proportion of trade debtors at 31 December 2010 that were overdue for payment was 37% 2009: 36%.
The group-wide average age of all trade debtors at year end was 57 days 2009: 56 days.
The monthly management accounts use the last three months sales of the year to calculate management trade debtor days.
Using this calculation the group-wide average age of trade debtors is 49 days 2009: 48 days at constant exchange rates.
The directors believe the fair value of trade and other receivables, being the present value of future cash fl ows, approximates to their book value.
Amounts receivable under service concession arrangements Amounts receivable under service concession arrangements comprise the groups proportion of amounts receivable in respect of the Private Finance Initiative PFI projects undertaken by the groups joint ventures.
The groups interests under PFI contracts primarily consist of the design, construction, fi nancing and management ofHM Prison and Young Offenders Institution Parc in Bridgend, South Wales, for the Home Offi ce: the Oakhill Secure Training Centre for young people inMilton Keynes for the Youth Justices Board: and Bloemfontein Correctional Contracts Pty for the Government of South Africa.
The Bridgend contractcommenced in January 1996 and expires in December 2022.
The Milton Keynes contract commenced in June 2003 and expires in June 2028.
TheBloemfontein contract commenced in July 2001 and ends in June 2026.
All contracts can be terminated by the customer either in the event of a severe failure to comply with the contract or voluntarily with six months notice ninety days for the Bloemfontein contract and the payment of appropriate compensation.
The specifi ed assets remain the property of the customers.
The groups joint ventures have the right to receive payment for the infrastructure and to provide services using the specifi ed assetsduring the life of the contracts.
There is currently no obligation to acquire or build further assets and any such obligation would be agreed with the customersas variations to the contracts.
The pricing basis is infl ation-indexed.
Amounts receivable under service concession arrangements are pledged as security against borrowings of the group.

The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system which included over 130 group companies at 31 December 2010.
It is anticipated that the number of participants in the group will continue to grow.
The group met the conditions of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation allowing balances within this cash pool to be offset for reporting purposes.
At 31 December 2010 230m 2009: 147m of the cash balances and the equivalent amount of the overdraft balances were offset.

At 31 December 2010, undrawn committed available facilities amounted to 552m 2009: 615m.
Interest on all committed bank borrowing facilities is at prevailing LIBOR or Euribor rates, dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus anagreed margin, and re-priced within one year or less.
Borrowing at fl oating rates exposes the group to cash fl ow interest rate risk.
The management of this risk is discussed in note 33.
The group issued fi xed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$550m 341m on 1 March 2007.
The group issued further fi xed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$514m 318m and 69m on 15 July 2008.
The group issued its inaugural public note of 350m using its European Medium Term Note Programme on 13 May 2009.
The committed bank facilities and the private loan notes are subject to one fi financial covenant net debt to EBITDA ratio and non-compliance with the covenant may lead to an acceleration of maturity.
The group complied with the fi financial covenant throughout the year to 31 December 2010 and the year to31 December 2009.
The group has not defaulted on, or breached the terms of, any material loans during the year.
Bank overdrafts, bank loans, the loan notes issued in July 2008 and the loan notes issued in May 2009 are stated at amortised cost.
The loan notes issued inMarch 2007 are stated at amortised cost recalculated at an effective interest rate current at the balance sheet date as they are part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The directors believe the fair value of the groups bank overdrafts, bank loans and the loan notes issued in March 2007, calculated from market prices, approximates to their book value.
US$265m 169m of the loan notes issued in July 2008 have a fair value market gain of 39m 2009: 30m.

The group believes that these returns are maximised when the groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC is minimised and that this is the case when the group broadly has the characteristics of an investment grade BBB rated entity.
The group therefore aims generally to maintain its net debt expressed as a multiple of cash generated from operations broadly within a range corresponding to those of BBB rated entities.
On 9 March 2009 the group obtained a BBB credit rating from Standard & Poors, which has been retained.
The group has a range of return on capital targets in respect of potential acquisitions, depending upon their size.
Most proposals for bolt-on acquisitions must demonstrate a post-tax return of at least 12% on the capital investment within three years.
Medium-sized acquisitions are required to return a minimum of 10% within this timeframe and relatively rare, large, strategic acquisitions a minimum equal to the groups WACC.
The groups calculation of its post-tax WACC at 31 December 2010 was 7.4%.
The group monitors the fi financial performance of acquired businesses during the years following acquisition against the return targets.
In addition, the group monitors the Return on Net Assets RONA of all its businesses on a monthly basis.
The group regards RONA as a measure of operational performance and therefore calculates it as EBITA divided by net assets excluding goodwill, tax, dividends payable and retirement benefi t obligations.
The group has no current intention to commence a share buy-back plan.
The group operates a programme to purchase its own shares on the market on aregular basis so as to provide a pool of shares from which to satisfy share awards to employees as the awards vest.
The group is not subject to externally-imposed capital requirements and there were no changes in the groups approach to capital management during theyear.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are suffi cient undrawn committed facilities available to it.
For more details of the groups bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 29.
The percentage of available, but undrawn committed facilities during the course of the year was as follows: 31 December 2009 28% 31 March 2010 21% 30 June 2010 21% 30 September 2010 19% 31 December 2010 26% To reduce re-fi nancing risk, group treasury obtains fi finance with a range of maturities and hence minimises the impact of a single material source of fi finance terminating on a single date.
Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Business review Overview 102 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 33 Financial risk continued The groups committed facilities, restated at hedged rates where applicable, have the following maturity dates: July 2013 33m March 2014 64m July 2015 76m March 2016 1,100m July 2016 25m March 2017 128m July 2018 180m March 2019 93m May 2019 350m July 2020 48m March 2022 67m Re-fi nancing risk is further reduced by group treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major facility at least 18 months before its termination date.
On 10 March 2011 the group completed its refi finance of its multi-currency revolving credit facility.
The new 1.1bn facility has a margin of 0.80% over LIBOR and matures in March 2016.
Market risk Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts The group conducts business in many currencies.
Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its fi nancing activities in local currency.
However, the group presents its consolidated fi financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial proportion of its exposure to fl uctuations inthe translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
The group no longer uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans.
This foreign exchange hedging programme was terminated in February 2009.
The group believes cash fl ow should not be put at risk by these instruments in order to preserve the carrying value of net assets, given the changed liquidity environment post the global credit crisis.
At 31 December 2010, the groups US dollar and euro net assets were approximately 65% and 60% respectively hedged by foreign currency loans 2009:USdollar 75%, euro 87%.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 134m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fi xing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at fl oating rates as described in note 29 exposes the group to cash fl ow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fi x the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings onareducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of fi five years.
At 31 December 2010 the nominal value of such contracts was 134m in respect of USdollar 2009: 170m and 167m in respect of euro 2009: 218m, their weighted average interest rate was 5.0% US dollar 2009: 5.0% and 3.7% euro 2009: 3.7 %, and their weighted average period to maturity was one and a half years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash fl ow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fi xed rate market, with investors looking for a fi xed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the fi first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of fl oating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fi xed rate debt arranged fi xed to fl oating swaps effectively converting the fi xed coupon on the Private Placement to a fl oating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented asfair value hedges of the US Private Placement fi xed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profi t and loss at thesame time asthe movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on the GBP Public Bond issued in May 2009 was kept at fi xed rate.
The core group borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is partly shielded by fi xed rate loans and interest rate swaps which fi x a portion of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains.
Assuming a 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies and keeping the 31 December 2010 debt position constant throughout 2011, an additional interest charge of 8m would be expected in the 2011 fi financial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fl uctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
Commodity swaps and commodity options are used to fi x synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Commodity swaps hedging 18 million litres of projected 2011 diesel consumption, 15 million litres of projected 2012 diesel consumption, 15 million litres of projected 2013 diesel consumption and 7 million litres of projected 2014 diesel consumption were in place at 31 December 2010.
Counterparty credit risk The groups strategy for treasury credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the fi financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception ofthe transaction, the fi financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 103 33 Financial risk continued Counterparty credit risk continued Treasury transactions are dealt with the groups relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2010 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were 37m and 21m and both were held with institutions with long-term Moodys credit ratings of Aa3.
These exposures represent 39% and 21% of the carrying values of derivative fi financial instrument, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had signifi cant loans outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2010.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of an Aa3 rated bank.
At year end credit balances of 230m were pooled with debit balances of 236m, resulting in a net pool balance of 6m.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies.
Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances, counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 12 months.
Due to the groups global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.
34 Retirement benefi t obligations The group operates a wide range of retirement benefi t arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defi ned contribution and funded and unfunded defi ned benefi t schemes.
Defi ned contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefi t arrangements operated by the group are of a defi ned contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is fi xed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defi ned contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 110m 2009: 109m.
In the UK, following the closure of the defi ned benefi t schemes to new entrants in 2004, the main scheme for new employees is a contracted-in defi ned contribution scheme.
Wackenhut Services, Inc WSI is the administrator of several defi ned benefi t schemes.
WSI is responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various defi ned benefi t schemes as determined by independent actuaries.
In each instance, the US Department of Energy DOE acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and WSI its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefi t liabilities.
Therefore, these schemes are accounted for as defi ned contribution schemes.
In the Netherlands, most employees are members of industry-wide defi ned benefi t schemes which are not valued on an IAS 19 basis as it is not possible toidentify separately the groups share of the schemes assets and liabilities.
As a result the schemes are accounted for as defi ned contribution schemes.
Contributions made to the schemes and charged to the income statement in 2010 totalled 8m 2009: 7m.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the fi financial year commencing 1 January 2011 in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefi ts is approximately 8massuming consistent exchange rates.
Defi ned benefi t arrangements The group operates a number of defi ned benefi t retirement arrangements where the benefi ts are based on employees length of service.
In most cases these are calculated on the basis of fi final pensionable pay, other than for the smallest of the three sections in the UK and one scheme in the Netherlands where they are based on career average pay.
Liabilities under these arrangements are stated at the discounted value of benefi ts accrued to date, based uponactuarial advice.
Under unfunded arrangements, the group does not hold the related assets separate from the group.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these arrangements in 2010 totalled 3m 2009: 3m.
Under funded arrangements, the assets of defi ned benefi t schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The pension costs are assessed on the advice of qualifi ed independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Thegroup operates several funded defi ned retirement benefi t schemes.
Whilst the groups primary scheme is in the UK, it also operates other material schemes in the Netherlands, Canada, Israel and Greece.
The carrying values of retirement benefi t obligations at the balance sheet date are presented below: 2010 2009 m m UK 256 307 Rest of World 9 21 Net liability on material funded defi ned retirement benefi t schemes 265 328 Unfunded and other funded defi ned retirement benefi t obligations 41 40 306 368 Less: Amounts included within current liabilities 61 55 Included within non-current liabilities 245 313 The defi ned benefi t scheme in the UK accounts for 97% of the net balance sheet liability on material funded defi ned retirement benefi t schemes.
It comprises three sections: the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A S with total membership of approximately 8,000: the Securicor scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, with total membership of approximately 20,000: and the GSL scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of GSL, with total membership of approximately 2,000.
Thethree schemes in the UK have combined under one trustee body with effect from 1 January 2010 and the resultant scheme was formally actuarially assessed at 5 April 2009.
Pension obligations stated in the statement of fi financial position take account of future earnings increases, have been updated to 31December 2010 and use the valuation methodologies specifi ed in IAS 19 Employee Benefi ts.
Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Business review Overview 104 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 34 Retirement benefi t obligations continued Since the year end the group has entered into a consultation period with a view to closing the UK scheme to future accrual during 2011 which would limit the future growth in liabilities.
Existing members would retain their benefi ts accrued to-date and would be transferred to a new defi ned contribution scheme for future pension benefi ts.
During the year the UK Government announced that the minimum rates at which pensions will increase will change from using RPI to CPI.
This change hasresulted in a one-off reduction in the liabilities, mainly associated with UK deferred pensioners, by 32m.
This has been accounted for as a credit to reservesin line with the recently announced UITF 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the Retail Prices Index with the Consumer Prices Index for Retirement Benefi ts.
As at the latest actuarial valuation, the participants of the UK pension scheme sections can be analysed as follows: Group 4 Falck GSL Securicor At 5 April 2009 Scheme Scheme Scheme Total Active participants Number 618 1,311 1,409 3,338 Average age 53.2 50.8 51.9 51.7 Deferred participants Number 4,559 537 10,352 15,448 Average age 51.3 48.4 50.8 50.9 Pensioner participants Number 2,607 208 7,878 10,693 Average age 68.2 61.1 69.9 69.3 The weighted average principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: UK Rest of World Key assumptions used at 31 December 2010 Discount rate 5.5% 5.6% Expected return on scheme assets as at 1 January 2010 6.9% 5.6% Expected rate of salary increases 3.6% 2.3% Future pension increases LPI5% 3.3% 1.4% Infl ation 3.5% 2.1% Key assumptions used at 31 December 2009 Discount rate 5.7% 5.7% Expected return on scheme assets as at 1 January 2009 6.3% 5.8% Expected rate of salary increases 3.6% 2.6% Future pension increases LPI5% 3.4% 2.0% Infl ation 3.6% 2.0% In addition to the above, the group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes obligations.

G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 107 34 Retirement benefi t obligations continued There was a signifi cant restructuring of the UK assets during the course of 2010 and the fund is now invested in a wider range of assets than previously.
Thecomposition of the scheme assets at the reporting date is as follows: UK Rest of World Total 2010 Equity instruments 18% 38% 19% Debt instruments 16% 43% 18% Property 0% 3% 0% Cash 24% 2% 23% Other assets 42% 14% 40% 100% 100% 100% 2009 Equity instruments 59% 45% 57% Debt instruments 26% 38% 27% Property 0% 10% 1% Other assets 15% 7% 15% 100% 100% 100% Other assets in the UK comprised a range of derivatives, private equity holdings, macro-orientated and multi-strategy alternative investments and a credit portfolio including corporate bond exposure, credit long short funds and distressed debt investments.
None of the pension scheme assets are held in the entitys own fi financial instruments or in any assets held or used by the entity.
The expected weighted average rates of return on scheme assets for the following year at the balance sheet date are as follows: UK Rest of World Total 2010 return expected in 2011 7.0% 4.5% 6.8% 2009 return expected in 2010 6.9% 5.6% 6.8% 2008 return expected in 2009 6.3% 5.9% 6.3% For the UK, the expected return on assets is based on the return targeted under the new investment strategy.
For the rest of the world the expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined with respect to bonds by reference to relevant indices, and with respect to other assets by reference to relevant indices of the historical return and economic forecasts of future returns relative to infl ation in respect of assets of a similar nature.
The overall expected rate of return is the weighted average of the rates on the individual asset categories.
The history of experience adjustments is as follows: UK Rest of World Total 2010 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 28 3 31 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 2 3 2 Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount m 7 4 3 Percentage of scheme assets % 4 2009 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 10 2 8 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 1 1 Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount m 133 8 141 Percentage of scheme assets % 11 9 11 2008 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 1 1 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 1 Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount m 315 17 332 Percentage of scheme assets % 30 21 30 Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Business review Overview 108 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued 34 Retirement benefi t obligations continued UK Rest of World Total 2007 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 6 3 3 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 4 Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount m 17 5 22 Percentage of scheme assets % 1 7 2 2006 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 29 29 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 2 2 Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount m 45 3 48 Percentage of scheme assets % 4 6 4 The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the fi financial year commencing 1 January 2011 in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefi ts should be approximately 1020m depending on the outcome of the consultation period and whether the UK scheme is closed to future accrual.
Additional contributions of approximately 35m will also be made in 2011 in respect of the defi cit in the schemes.
IAS 19 specifi es that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates.
The directors consider that it is appropriate to apply the average of the yields on those AA corporate bonds which most closely approximate to the timescale of the liability profi le of the schemes and have therefore used such a rate, being 5.5%, in respect of the UK schemes at 31 December 2010 5.7% at 31 December 2009.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 26m.
Liability calculations are also impacted heavily by the mortality projections included in the actuarial assumptions.
The weighted average life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 has been assumed as 20.4 years.
The weighted average life expectancy at 65 of a male currently aged 52has been assumed as 22.1 years.
The directors consider, on actuarial advice, these assumptions to be appropriate to the profi le of the membership of theschemes.
The effect of a one year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 73m.
Pension obligations in respect of deferred members increase in line with infl ation.
Increases in salaries and increases in pensions-in-payment generally move in line with infl ation.
Infl ation is therefore an important assumption in the calculation of defi ned retirement benefi t liabilities.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the rate of infl ation assumption applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 12m.

Restructuring Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and discontinued operations.
Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable.
The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 109 35 Provisions continued Claims reserves The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the US which underwrite part of the groups cash solutions, general liability, workers compensation and auto liability policies.
The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted as appropriate.
Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the fi final settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims.
Onerous contracts The onerous contract provision mainly comprises the provision against future liabilities for loss-making contracts, for all properties sub-let at a shortfall, for the cost of replacing assets where there is a present contractual requirement and for long-term idle, leased properties.
The provision is based on the value offuture net cash outfl ows.
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration.
36 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods: Retirement Other benefi t Intangible temporary obligations assets Tax losses differences Total m m m m m At 1 January 2009 82 116 8 44 18 Charge credit to the income statement 5 23 20 2 40 Acquisition of subsidiaries 17 17 Credit to equity 17 17 Translation adjustments 3 5 2 Transfers other 2 1 1 At 31 December 2009 92 106 28 42 56 At 1 January 2010 92 106 28 42 56 Charge credit to the income statement 11 26 2 3 10 Acquisition of subsidiaries 3 3 Disposal of subsidiaries 2 2 Charge credit to equity 7 5 2 Translation adjustments 1 3 1 1 At 31 December 2010 75 84 27 45 63 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where permitted.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for fi financial reporting purposes: 2010 2009 m m Deferred tax liabilities 98 122 Deferred tax assets 161 178 Total deferred tax position 63 56 At 31 December 2010, the group has unutilised tax losses of approximately 526m 2009: 528m potentially available for offset against future profi ts.
Adeferred tax asset of 27m 2009: 27m has been recognised in respect of approximately 76m 2009: 78m of gross losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 450m 2009: 450m of gross losses due to the unpredictability of future profi t streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a signifi cant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of 5m, 3m, 2m and 1m which will expire in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively.
Other losses may be carried forward indefi nitely.
At 31 December 2010, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 1,445m 2009: 1,329m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these gross differences on the basis that the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
