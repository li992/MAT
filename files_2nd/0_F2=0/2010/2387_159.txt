Derivative financial instruments An outline of the groups financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 27.
In the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.
IAS 39 prescribes strict criteria for hedge accounting, whether as a cash flow or fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, and requires that any derivative that does not meet these criteria should be classified as held for trading and fair valued, with gains and losses recognized in the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments continued Derivatives held for trading The group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives.
The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading.
Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods.
The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 27.
The following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
Derivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.

This deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all of the remaining contract term can be valued using observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.
Changes in valuation from this initial valuation are recognized immediately through the income statement.

IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy which consists of three levels that describe the methodology of estimation as follows: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 using inputs for the asset or liability, other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data such as prices based on internal models or other valuation methods.
This information is presented on a gross basis, that is, before netting by counterparty.
Derivative financial instruments continued The following table shows the changes during the year in the net fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Gains and losses relating to derivative contracts are included either within sales and other operating revenues or within purchases in the income statement depending upon the nature of the activity and type of contract involved.
The contract types treated in this way include futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
Also included within sales and other operating revenues are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all of these items was a net gain of $1,428 million 2009 $3,735 million net gain and 2008 $6,721 million net gain.
Embedded derivatives Prior to the development of an active gas trading market, UK gas contracts were priced using a basket of available price indices, primarily relating to oil products, power and inflation.
After the development of an active UK gas market, certain contracts were entered into or renegotiated using pricing formulae not directly related to gas prices, for example, oil product and power prices.
In these circumstances, pricing formulae have been determined to be derivatives, embedded within the overall contractual arrangements that are not clearly and closely related to the underlying commodity.
The resulting fair value relating to these contracts is recognized on the balance sheet with gains or losses recognized in the income statement.
All the embedded derivatives relate to commodity prices, are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from active market pricing data.
Where necessary, these are extrapolated to the expiry of the contracts the last of which is in 2018 using all available external pricing information.
Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are interpolated using historic and long-term pricing relationships.
Embedded derivative assets and liabilities have the following fair values and maturities.
Derivative financial instruments continued The following table shows the changes during the year in the net fair value of embedded derivatives, within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The amount recognized in the income statement for the year relating to level 3 embedded derivatives still held at 31 December 2010 was a $350 million loss 2009 $347 million gain relating to embedded derivatives still held at 31 December 2009.
The fair value gain loss on embedded derivatives is shown below.

Note 27 outlines the management of risk aspects for currency and interest rate risk.
For cash flow hedges the group only claims hedge accounting for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to the income statement.
There were no highly probable transactions for which hedge accounting has been claimed that have not occurred and no significant element of hedge ineffectiveness requiring recognition in the income statement.
For cash flow hedges the pre-tax amount removed from equity during the period and included in the income statement is a gain of $25 million 2009 loss of $366 million and 2008 loss of $45 million.
The entire gain of $25 million is included in production and manufacturing expenses 2009 $332 million loss in production and manufacturing expense and $34 million loss in finance costs: 2008 $1 million loss in production and manufacturing expense and $44 million loss in finance costs.
The amount removed from equity during the period and included in the carrying amount of non-financial assets was a loss of $53 million 2009 $136 million loss and 2008 $38 million gain.
The amounts retained in equity at 31 December 2010 are expected to mature and impact the income statement by a gain of $89 million in 2011, a loss of $23 million in 2012 and a loss of $50 million in 2013 and beyond.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2010, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
The effectiveness of each hedge relationship is quantitatively assessed and demonstrated to continue to be highly effective.
The gain on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in 2010 was $563 million 2009 $98 million loss and 2008 $2 million gain offset by a loss on the fair value of the finance debt of $554 million 2009 $117 million gain and 2008 $20 million loss.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps have an average maturity of four to five years, 2009 four to five years and are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar denominated borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt.
Note 27 outlines the groups approach to interest rate risk management.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The group held currency swap contracts as a hedge of a long-term investment in a UK subsidiary that expired in 2009.
The loss on the hedge recognized in equity in 2008 was $38 million.
US dollars had been sold forward for sterling purchased and matched the underlying liability with no significant ineffectiveness reflected in the income statement.
