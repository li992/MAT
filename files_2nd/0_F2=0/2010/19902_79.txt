Segment reporting Segment information for the Group is presented in respect of the Groups business segments based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
The Group undertakes its Development and Investment activities directly and in joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and have similar economic and other characteristics to the Groups direct activities.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis and is reported excluding mark to market and valuation movements.
The Directors do not consider that the Group has meaningful geographical segments as it operated exclusively in the United Kingdom in the year.
The Groups Development segment undertakes the acquisition and development of properties, including the manufacture and sale of modular building components to practical completion.
The Development segments revenue predominantly comprises the sales proceeds of properties, including those sold to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund: it also includes revenue from the sale of modules to third parties and joint ventures, and development management fees earned from joint ventures.
The Investment segment comprises the asset and property management of completed properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from net rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.
a Adjusted results The Group reports an adjusted profit loss, on the basis recommended for real estate companies by EPRA, the European Public Real Estate Association, with the exception of profits and losses relating to sales or impairments to trading properties.
EPRA recommends that real estate investment companies exclude these items as they are one-off in nature, however, the development of properties for future sale is an ongoing business activity for the Group and therefore results of this core activity are included in the adjusted result.
The adjusted result excludes movements relating to changes in values of investment properties and interest rate swaps, profits on disposal of investment properties and the related tax effects.
The adjusted net assets are shown on the basis recommended for real estate companies by EPRA, which excludes the mark to market valuation of swaps, deferred tax liabilities and recognises all properties at market value.
The segmental analysis set out in detail in notes 2 b to e have been summarised on an adjusted basis below.
