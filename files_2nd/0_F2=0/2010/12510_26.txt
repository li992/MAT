General information Premier Foods plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985 as amended and restated, registered number 5160050, with its registered office at Premier House, Centrium Business Park, Griffiths Way, St Albans, Hertfordshire, AL1 2RE.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group are food manufacturing, processing and distribution.
Further information about the Groups activities can be found in the Group at a Glance section of this annual report.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 7 March 2011.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation The Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
The consolidated financial statements of Premier Foods plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union EU, International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and on the historical cost basis with the exception of derivative financial instruments, defined benefit pension schemes and share-based payments which are incorporated using fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
The following accounting standards and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB or IFRIC as endorsed by the EU, are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group: IAS 1 Revised First Time Adoption of IFRS IFRS 1 Amendment Additional Exemptions IFRS 1 IAS 27 Amendment Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS 2 Amendment Share-based Payments Group Cash-Settled Share-based Payment Transactions IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 39 Amendment Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on Eligible Hedged Items IFRIC 15 Agreement for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets From Customers The application of the standards and interpretations has not had a material effect on the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group.
New standards and interpretations not applied Up to and during the year ended 31 December 2010, the IASB and the IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date as endorsed by the EU after the date of these financial statements: Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after: International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1 Amendment First time Adoption of Financial Instrument Disclosures 1 July 2010 IAS 24 Revised Related Party Disclosure 1 January 2011 IAS 32 Amendment Financial Instruments: Presentation on Classification of Rights Issues 1 February 2010 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC 14 Amendment Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement 1 January 2011 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments 1 July 2010 These standards will be adopted by the Group in future accounting periods.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.

Accounting policies continued The following standards and amendments to published standards have not been endorsed by the EU: International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1 Amendment First Time Adoption on Hyperinflation and Fixed Dates IFRS 7 Amendment Financial Instruments: Disclosures IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IAS 12 Amendment Income Taxes on Deferred Tax 2.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Premier Foods plc and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used for all acquisitions.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values as at that date.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
In addition, comparatives are also restated to reclassify disposed businesses into discontinued operations.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
All inter-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
2.3 Revenue Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of sales rebates, discounts, value added tax and other taxes directly attributable to revenue and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue is recognised when the outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is recognised on the following basis: i Sale of goods Sales of goods are recognised as revenue on transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership, which generally coincides with the time when the merchandise is delivered to customers and title passes.
ii Sales rebates and discounts Sales rebates and discount reserves are established based on managements best estimate of the amounts necessary to meet claims by the Groups customers in respect of these rebates and discounts.
The provision is made at the time of sale and released, if unutilised, after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made has become remote.
2.4 Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
See note 4 for further details.
2.5 Share-based payments The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
2.6 Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling, the Groups presentational currency, at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
The results of overseas subsidiaries with functional currencies other than in sterling are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange ruling in the year.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the closing rate.
Exchange differences arising from retranslation at year end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recorded in reserves as a separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is sold exchange differences previously taken to equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
All other exchange gains or losses are recorded in the income statement.

Accounting policies continued 2.7 Dividends Dividend distribution to the Groups shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Groups shareholders, and for interim dividends, in the period in which they are paid.
2.8 Property, plant and equipment PPE Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost.
Subsequent expenditure is added to the carrying value of the asset when it is probable that incremental future economic benefits will transfer to the Group.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the period it is incurred.
Differences between the cost of each item of PPE and its residual value are written off over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method.
Reviews of the estimated remaining useful lives and residual values of individual productive assets are performed annually, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The useful economic lives of owned assets range from 20 to 50 years for buildings, and 3 to 35 years for vehicles, plant and equipment.
All items of PPE are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
2.9 Business combinations and goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration for a business exceeds the fair value of the aggregate of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Items of PPE acquired as part of a business acquisition are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition using a market value or depreciated replacement cost model.
On acquisition, the Group undertakes a review of the accounting policies of the business acquired to ensure compliance both with IFRS and the accounting policies of the Group.
2.10 Intangible assets In addition to goodwill the Group recognises the following intangible assets: Acquired intangibles Acquired trade marks, brands, customer relationships, licences, recipes and similar assets that are controlled through custody or legal rights and that could be sold separately from the rest of the business are capitalised, where fair value can be reliably measured.
A reputable independent specialist performs the valuations.
All of these assets are considered to have finite lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives that range from 7 to 40 years.
Research and development Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Costs incurred in developing a product, typically its recipe or packaging, are charged to income in the year in which they are incurred unless the future economic benefits of the project can be regarded as reasonably certain and are in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets IAS 38, in which case they are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Software development costs Assets acquired or internally developed, such as software, are capitalised when the future economic benefit is reasonably assured and the criteria within IAS 38 are met.
Software development costs are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over a range of 3 to 10 years.
2.11 Impairment The useful economic lives of intangible assets are determined based on a review of a combination of factors including the asset ownership rights acquired and the nature of the overall product life cycle.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when an event that might affect asset values has occurred.
An impairment loss is recognised, in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future earnings from operating the assets in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing on indication of impairment.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately.
2.12 Interest i Interest expense Borrowing costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method.
ii Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable, taking into consideration the interest element of derivatives.
indd 83 09 03 2011 11:26:14 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.13 Leases Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group, are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the minimum lease payments or fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included under borrowings.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
2.14 Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Where appropriate, cost includes production and other attributable overhead expenses as described in IAS 2 Inventories.
Cost is calculated on a first-in, first-out basis by reference to the invoiced value of supplies and attributable costs of bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where the estimated selling price is lower than cost.
2.15 Taxation The charge or credit for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account deferred taxation.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit.
Deferred taxation is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than in a business combination, if at the time of the transaction there is no effect on either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.16 Employee benefits Group companies provide a number of long-term employee benefit arrangements, primarily through pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds determined by periodic independent actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
Defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
Current service costs, past-service costs, administration costs, expected return on assets and interest costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity, which then invests the contributions to buy annuities for the pension liabilities as they become due based on the value of the fund, hence the Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
2.17 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Where material, the Group discounts its provisions.

Accounting policies continued 2.18 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or the amount of obligation cannot be measured reliably.
A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
When an outflow becomes probable, it is recognised as a provision.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent assets are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
When inflow is virtually certain an asset is recognised.
2.19 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision is made for impairment when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the receivables.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
The rights and obligations relating to those trade receivables that have been sold to third parties are fide-recognised from the balance sheet where the risks and rewards of ownership are considered to have transferred.
Cash received from third parties in exchange for the transfer of ownership is recorded within cash and cash equivalents with the cost of financing prior to settlement by the customer recorded as interest on an accruals basis.
Amounts received from customers for receivables in respect of which title has transferred, for example under the debtors securitisation programme, represent amounts owed to the transferee and are recorded as short-term borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, with original maturities at inception of less than 90 days, comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash in hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and inclusive of debt issuance costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for borrowing costs.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade payables and other liabilities are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risk and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Movements in fair value of foreign exchange derivatives are recognised within other operating income and expense and those relating to interest rate swaps are recorded within the net movement on fair valuation of interest rate financial instruments.
Other items at fair value through profit or loss Other items at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Movements in fair value are recorded within the net movement on fair valuation of interest rate financial instruments.
See notes 9 and 22 for further details.

Accounting policies continued Net investment hedge Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within other operating income and expenditure.
2.20 Investment in own shares Investments in own shares are shown as a deduction in shareholders funds.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The following are areas of particular significance to the Groups financial statements and include the application of judgement, which is fundamental to the compilation of a set of financial statements.
3.1 Pensions The present value of the Groups pension obligations depends on a number of actuarial assumptions.
The primary assumptions used include the discount rate applicable to scheme liabilities, the long-term rate of inflation and estimates of the mortality applicable to scheme members.
At each reporting date, and on a continuous basis, the Group reviews the macro-economic, Company and scheme specific factors influencing each of these assumptions, using professional advice, in order to record the Groups ongoing commitment and obligation to defined benefit schemes in accordance with IFRS.
One such assumption is the assumption of mortality rates and how these are expected to change in the future.
If the Groups assumption on the mortality of its members was amended to assume an increase of a further one year improvement in mortality, total liabilities would increase by approximately 3.8%.
Each 0.1% decrease increase in bond yields would increase decrease the deficit by a further 51m 49m.
Each 0.1% increase decrease in the assumed inflation rate would increase decrease the deficit by a further 18m 21m.
Each of the underlying assumptions is set out in more detail in note 25.
3.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets Impairment reviews in respect of goodwill are performed annually unless an event indicates that an impairment review is necessary.
Impairment reviews in respect of intangible assets are performed when an event indicates that an impairment review is necessary.
Examples of such triggering events include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions or technology, expectations of future operating losses, or a significant reduction in cash flows.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units CGUs are determined based on the higher of realisable value and value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates.
The Group has considered the impact of the assumptions used on the calculations and has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of the CGUs carrying values.
See note 15 for further details.
Acquired trade marks, brands, customer relationships, recipes and similar assets are considered to have finite lives that range from 7 to 40 years.
The determination of the useful lives takes into account certain quantitative factors such as sales expectations and growth prospects, and also many qualitative factors such as history and heritage, and market positioning, hence the determination of useful lives are subject to estimates and judgement.
For further details see note 16.
3.3 Advertising and promotion costs Trade spend and promotional activity is dependent on market conditions and negotiations with customers.
Trade spend is charged to the income statement according to the substance of the agreements with customers and the terms of any contractual relationship.
Promotional support is generally charged to the income statement at the time of the relevant promotion.
These costs are accrued on best estimates.
The actual costs may not be known until subsequent years when negotiations with customers are concluded.
Such adjustments are recognised in the year when final agreement is reached.
Expenditure on advertising is charged to the income statement when incurred, except in the case of airtime costs when a particular campaign is used more than once.
In this case they are charged in line with the airtime profile.
3.4 Exceptional items Exceptional items are not explicitly addressed under IFRS.
Accordingly, the Group has defined exceptional items as those items of sufficient financial significance to be disclosed separately in order to assist in understanding the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
Each of these items relates to events or circumstances that are material and non-recurring in nature, such as integration of an acquisition, disposal of a business or major asset, material impairments or refinancing related transactions.
See note 6 for further details.
3.5 Securitisation The Group has sold the rights and obligations relating to certain of its trade receivable balances under a receivables purchasing agreement in order to achieve an overall lower cost of funding and permanently accelerate the generation of cash from working capital.
Accounting for a sale of this nature is judgemental and dependent on evidence of the substantive transfer of risk and reward from the Group to a third party.
In this instance, transference of the two primary risks, those of late payment and credit default was achieved at the balance sheet date.
The Group anticipates that the receivables purchasing agreement will remain in place over the medium term and that fide-recognition of the receivables subject to it will continue to be achieved, dependent upon ongoing review of the assessment of risk and reward transfer.

Accounting policies continued 3.6 Financial instruments The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the risks arising from adverse movements in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency.
The Group has a policy of not applying hedge accounting to these derivatives other than in the case of a Net Investment Hedge against euro denominated assets and taking any gain or loss on the movement of the fair values of derivatives to the income statement.
Segmental analysis IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly business review meetings, as the key measure of the segments results as it reflects the segments underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation.
Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group and the reporting of this measure at the monthly business review meetings, which are organised according to product types, has been used to identify and determine the Groups operating segments.
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, the revaluation of foreign exchange and other derivative contracts under IAS 39 and pension credits or charges in relation to the difference between the expected return on pension assets, administration costs and interest costs on pension liabilities.
The Groups operating segments are Grocery, Hovis, Retailer Branded Chilled and Meat-free.
The Group previously aggregated and reported the Retailer Branded Chilled and Meat-free operating segments in the Other segment, as they did not meet the relevant quantitative thresholds and did not have similar economic characteristics and therefore could not be aggregated into their own separate reporting segment under IFRS 8.
As a result of the Groups announcement to sell the Meat-free business, results for the Meat-free operating segment are presented as discontinued operations in both the current year and prior year comparatives.
Subsequent to year end, the Group announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its East Anglian canned grocery operations, which is part of the Grocery segment.
The results of the East Anglian canned grocery operations for the year ended 31 December 2010 are included within continuing operations as it is not a separate operating segment.
The Group reports the remaining operating segments on three continuing segments within the business: Grocery, Hovis and Retailer Branded Chilled.
The Grocery segment sells ambient food products.
The Hovis segment sells bread, morning goods, flour products and frozen pizza bases and the Retailer Branded Chilled segment includes businesses which sell chilled ready meals and cakes.
The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2010 and for the year ended 31 December 2009 and the reconciliation of the segment measures to the respective statutory items included in the consolidated financial statements are as follows: Year ended 31 Dec 2010 Retailer Branded Total for Grocery Hovis Chilled Group m m m m Revenue from continuing operations External 1,546.8 687.6 203.6 2,438.0 Inter-segment 3.9 27.7 2.5 34.1 Result Trading profit loss 256.2 38.8 0.1 294.9 Amortisation of intangible assets 78.9 Fair value movements on foreign exchange and other derivative contracts 2.0 Pension financing credit 4.1 Operating profit before exceptional items 218.1 Exceptional items 125.0 Operating profit 93.1 Interest payable and other financial charges 160.1 Interest receivable and other financial income 12.0 Net movement on fair valuation of interest rate financial instruments 43.3 Loss before taxation for continuing operations 98.3 Depreciation 25.9 17.3 4.4 47.6 Amortisation 47.4 18.3 13.2 78.9 Impairment of property, plant and equipment 0.7 0.7 Impairment of goodwill 125.0 125.0 Balance sheet Segment assets 2,297.2 663.1 424.1 3,384.4 Unallocated assets 115.1 Consolidated total assets 3,499.5 Stock code: PFD www.

Balance sheet Segment assets 2,414.2 694.0 564.0 3,672.2 Unallocated assets 27.4 Consolidated total assets 3,699.6 Revenues, on a continuing basis, of approximately 454.0m and 336.9m 2009: 478.3m and 340.2m are derived from two external customers.
These revenues are attributable across the three reporting segments above.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the same terms and conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties.
As a consequence of extensive integration of the business, certain operating costs have been incurred centrally.
These costs are allocated to reporting segments on an appropriate basis depending on the various cost drivers and therefore the total segment result is equal to the Groups total trading profit.
Segment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, inventories, receivables and retirement benefit assets and exclude cash and cash equivalents, derivative assets and certain Corporate assets that are not able to be allocated to the Groups reporting segments.
Unallocated assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, taxation balances, derivative financial assets and head office assets.
In 2010, this includes Group-wide software and hardware assets that were previously reported within the Grocery segment.
The Group primarily supplies the UK market, although it also supplies certain products to other European countries and a number of other countries.
The following table provides an analysis of the Groups revenue, which is allocated on the basis of geographical market destination and an analysis of the Groups non current assets excluding retirement benefit assets by geographical location.

Exceptional items Up to 2009, the Group was incurring a large amount of spend for restructuring and investment in the business.
These items were treated as exceptional items and excluded from trading profit.
The level of restructuring is now likely to run at a normal level from 2010, and as a result, the Group has included the costs of restructuring and investment within trading profit.
The comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2009 have been restated to reflect the change in this classification.
The Group has completed its major integration and manufacturing rationalisation programmes following the acquisitions of RHM and Campbells.
As a result, the Group has not incurred any exceptional expenditure during the year, other than the impairment charge recognised against the goodwill allocated to the Brookes Avana CGU see note 15.

a Integration of RHM UK operations On 16 March 2007, the Group acquired RHM plc.
During 2009, the Group completed its factory closure programme, but residual costs were incurred in the previous year from the commissioning of equipment and production transferred to remaining Group manufacturing sites.
Redundancy and restructuring costs were also incurred in the previous year relating to the move of administrative functions to a Group-wide share service centre in Manchester and the integration of certain warehousing facilities to other Group warehouses.
The adverse market conditions during 2009 also resulted in a charge to increase onerous property lease provisions.
b Integration of Campbells UK operations The charge in the previous year primarily related to an increase in an onerous property lease provision to reflect the adverse market conditions.
c Integration of Irish operations The recession in Ireland has resulted in significant strategic changes by the Groups Irish customer base, with moves to sourcing products directly from the UK and a shift from primarily store-based trading to central purchasing and distribution.
In the previous year a charge was recognised as the Group announced its decision to rationalise part of its Irish operations.
d Impairment of goodwill An impairment charge of 125.0m has been recognised against the goodwill allocated to the Brookes Avana CGU see note 15. e Refinancing costs Advisory fees were incurred during the previous year relating to the placing and open offer and firm placing, amended lending agreements, renegotiation of interest rate swaps and new pensions framework.

Interest payable and receivable 2010 In October 2010, the Group restructured all of its five long dated swaps and its two other callable swaps into six new fixed rate swaps all maturing in 2013.
These new fixed rate swaps are hybrid instruments comprising an underlying host with embedded derivatives and have been reclassified as Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair value movements below includes the reclassification of fair value from interest rate derivatives to Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss for those six swaps.
The total facility as at 31 December 2010 was 1,680m and will be amortised by 50m in both June and December of each year until December 2013.
2009 On 5 March 2009, the Group announced revised financing arrangements including a share issuance, changes to lending agreements to provide greater covenant and liquidity headroom and the extension of the maturity of the facility.
These revised financing arrangements were approved by ordinary shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on 23 March 2009.
The amendments to the Groups Term and Revolving Credit Facilities included a rephasing of the facilities to provide additional liquidity and covenant headroom and an extension of the maturity date to December 2013.
In respect of these amendments to the existing facilities and arrangement of the new facilities, the Group incurred costs of 26.1m, 3.0m of which were immediately charged to the income statement.
On 5 March 2009, the Group amended the break clauses in one of its long dated swaps to make it consistent with other long dated swaps.
At the same time the Group also restructured two other swaps into one new swap which resulted in an amendment to the payment terms and an amendment to the break clauses, being an optional break at August 2012 and a mandatory break at June 2013.
The terms were also amended such that it will now settle at either break point for a mark to market payment to the counterparty bank.
As a result of these amendments, a new contract was recognised which comprises both an underlying host as well as embedded derivatives.
This hybrid instrument was classified within a new class of financial liabilities being Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss has increased from a 198.7m liability at 31 December 2009 to a 234.5m liability at 31 December 2010 resulting in a net movement of 35.8m for the year.
This constitutes an adverse change on fair value of 43.3m offset by a 7.5m cash payment relating to the restructuring of one swap within Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss with a nominal value of 150m.
The change in fair value in the year is due to a change in the yield curve offset by amortisation refer to note 22.
The liability at 31 December 2010 represents the net present value of the interest cash flows calculated using the contracted fixed rates compared to the net present value of interest cash flows that would arise if the interest was calculated on a floating basis.

The reasons for this are explained below: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 2010 2009 1 Restated m m Loss profit before taxation for continuing operations 98.3 41.8 Tax credit charge at the domestic income tax rate of 28.0% 2009: 28.0% 27.5 11.7 Tax effect of: Non deductible exceptional items 35.0 4.5 Other disallowable items 0.7 0.3 Adjustment to reflect the abolition of tax relief for industrial buildings 1.0 Adjustment for share-based pay 1.9 0.9 Previously unrecognised losses utilised 2.9 Adjustment due to current year deferred tax being provided at 27.0% 0.4 Adjustment to restate opening deferred tax at 27.0% 4.6 Adjustments to prior years 14.3 8.7 Income tax credit charge 11.6 5.8 1 Comparatives have been restated to reflect the classification of the Meat-free business as a discontinued operation.
2 Act 2010, which was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, includes legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28.0% to 27.0% from 1 April 2011.
The 1.0% reduction for the 2011 financial year has been reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 by restating the deferred tax liability at 31 December 2009 giving a reduction of 5.6m.
In addition, the movements in deferred tax in the year have been reflected at 27.0%, being the rate at which the liabilities are expected to reverse, which has resulted in a 0.4m increase in the income tax credit.
Further reductions to the main rate of corporation tax are proposed to reduce the rate by 1.0% per annum to 24.0% by 1 April 2014.
However, as these further reductions in the main rate of corporation tax have not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date they are not reflected in the deferred tax recognised on the balance sheet.

Dilutive effect of share options The dilutive effect of share options is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The only dilutive potential ordinary shares of the Company are share options.
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
For the years ended 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009, there is no dilutive effect as the outstanding share options that could have been acquired at fair value is less than the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to these options.
The issue of 1,553,416,776 ordinary shares during the previous year has been included in determining the weighted average for the previous year see note 26.
No adjustment is made to the profit or loss in calculating undiluted and diluted loss earnings per share.

Net regular interest payable is defined as net interest after excluding non-cash items, namely exceptional write-off of financing costs, accelerated amortisation of debt issuance costs, fair value adjustments on interest rate financial instruments and the unwind of the discount on provisions.
Trading profit and Adjusted EPS have been reported as the directors believe these provide an alternative measure with which the shareholders can assess the Groups underlying trading performance.

Goodwill continued Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations or fair value less costs to sell, depending on the way in which the value of the CGU is expected to be recovered.
An impairment assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the Meat-free business has been undertaken by assessing the fair value less costs to sell in light of the decision to dispose of this business.
The goodwill assigned to the Meat-free business was tested for impairment prior to its classification as held for sale.
Key assumptions The key assumptions for calculating value in use are those relating to the cash flows, long-term growth rate and discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell in respect of the Meat-free business has been determined by reference to the value of the offer received, less the expected costs of disposing the business.
Cash flow assumptions The cash flows used in the value-in-use calculation are pre-tax cash flows based on the latest approved management forecasts in respect of the following five years.
Assumptions regarding these future cash flows are based upon actual results in prior periods and adjusted for expected developments in the following years with reference to market conditions and reasonable management expectations for the businesses.
All income and costs are taken into account and an estimate of capital expenditure required to maintain these cash flows is also made.
Long-term growth rate assumptions The five year management forecasts are extrapolated in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector.
The growth rate applied is 2.25% 2009: 2.25% and is not considered to be higher than the average long-term industry growth rate.
Discount rate The discount rate applied to the cash flows is calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC which would be anticipated for a market participant investing in the Group.
The directors believe it is appropriate to use a single common discount rate for all impairment testing as each CGU shares similar risk profiles.
The Group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment testing.
At 31 December 2010, the pre-tax rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows has been determined to be 12.3% 2009: 11.8%.
Impairment A total impairment charge of 150.0m has been recognised in the year 2009: nil.
Included within this charge is 125.0m recognised against the goodwill allocated to the Brookes Avana CGU thereby reducing the carrying value of this CGU to its recoverable amount.
This impairment has arisen as a result of adverse trading conditions and an increase in discount rate as noted above.
Any favourable change in assumptions in future periods will result in additional headroom however any adverse change would result in additional impairment.
A further charge of 25.0m is recognised against the goodwill allocated to the Meat-free business and has been recorded within discontinued operations.
The residual goodwill attributable to the Meat-free business of 64.6m has been transferred to assets held for sale.
The current economic climate has increased the discount rate adopted by the Group due to the higher level of return expected by equity holders due to the continued perceived risk and volatility in equity markets.
The Group has considered this impact on the assumptions used and has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the Hovis CGUs carrying value.
This has not resulted in any impairment of the carrying value at 31 December 2010 as the CGUs recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value by 55.6m.
However, the CGUs recoverable amount would be comparable to its carrying value if the discount rate were to increase by 1.0%.
Any favourable change in assumptions in future periods will result in additional headroom.
With regards to the remaining Grocery CGU, the directors believe no reasonable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment testing would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.

a Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement 2009 On 5 March 2009, the Group entered into a supplemental agreement with its banks amending certain terms of its Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement of 16 March 2007.
This original facility was arranged by Barclays Capital, Bayerische Landesbank, BNP Paribas, Rabobank International, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as lead arrangers and underwriters and Lloyds TSB Bank plc as facility agent and security trustee.
The Senior Term Credit Facility now comprises 1,180m of Term and a multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility of up to 500m or its equivalent in other currencies.
The final maturity date of the above arrangements is 31 December 2013. b Other unsecured loans Other unsecured loans falling due within one year includes amounts owed in respect of cash receipts from debtors previously sold under the debtors securitisation programme.
indd 101 09 03 2011 11:26:16 Notes to the financial statements continued 22.
Financial instruments The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk arising from adverse movements in interest rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage certain of these risks.
The management of these risks, along with the day-to-day management of treasury activities, is performed by the Group Treasury function.
The policy framework governing the management of these risks is defined by the Finance Committee, a sub-committee of the Board.
The framework for management of these risks is incorporated into a policies and procedures manual.
The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw material requirements, some of which are considered commodities, and also diesel and energy.
These commodity and energy contracts are part of the Groups normal purchasing activities.
Some of the risk relating to diesel is mitigated with the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Treasury Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the Finance Committee monitors and reviews the Groups foreign currency exchange, commodity price and energy price exposures and recommends appropriate hedging strategies for each.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Groups main operating entities functional currency and the Groups presentational currency is sterling although some transactions are executed in non-sterling currencies, including euros, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Swiss francs and Swedish kronor.
The transactional amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in these currencies against sterling.
Management of these exposures is centralised and managed by the Groups Treasury Function.
It is the Groups policy to manage the exposures arising using forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency options.
Hedge accounting is not sought for these transactions.
The Group generates some of its profits in non-sterling currencies and has assets in non-sterling jurisdictions, principally the euro.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group has euro denominated borrowings of nil 2009: 22.3m designated as a hedge of euro denominated assets.
The principal foreign currency affecting the translation of subsidiary undertakings within the Group financial statements is the euro.
The rates applicable are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec Principal rate of exchange EUR 2010 2009 Year end 1.1601 1.1185 Average 1.1584 1.1142 The majority of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in the functional currency of the relevant division or subsidiary.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures as at 31 December 2010 and 2009 that gave rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the consolidated income statement as a result of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiaries involved.

Financial instruments continued In addition, the Group also has forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at the year-end in order to manage the exposures above but also to hedge future transactions in foreign currencies.
The sterling nominal amounts outstanding are as follows: 2010 2009 Payable Payable receivable receivable m m Euro 42.6 46.0 US dollar 36.9 46.9 Swiss franc 1.1 1.8 Swedish krona 1.5 2.7 Australian dollar 0.2 Total 76.7 88.4 If the US dollar were to weaken against sterling by 20 US dollar cents, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would decrease by 3.3m 2009: 3.4m decrease.
If the US dollar were to strengthen against sterling by 20 US dollar cents, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would increase by 4.1m 2009: 4.9m increase.
If the euro were to weaken against sterling by 10 euro cents, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would decrease by 3.1m 2009: 1.7m decrease.
If the euro were to strengthen against sterling by 10 euro cents, with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would increase by 3.0m 2009: 2.7m increase.
This is primarily driven by the effect on the mark to market valuation of the foreign exchange derivatives of the Group where the hedged rates differ from the spot rate.
If the euro were to weaken against sterling by 10 euro cents, the foreign exchange movement taken to equity in relation to the Net Investment Hedge would be an additional nil 2009: 1.6m gain.
If the euro were to strengthen against sterling by 10 euro cents, the foreign exchange movement taken to equity in relation to the Net Investment Hedge would be an additional nil 2009: 2.0m loss.
ii Commodity price risk The Group purchases a variety of commodities for use in production and distribution which can experience significant price volatility, which include, inter-alia, wheat, tinplate, diesel and energy.
The price risk on these commodities is managed by the Group through the Treasury Risk Management Committee.
It is the Groups policy to minimise its exposure to this volatility by adopting an appropriate forward purchase strategy or by the use of derivative instruments where they are available.
iii Interest rate risk The Groups borrowing facilities comprise term debt and a revolving facility, principally in sterling.
Interest is charged at floating rates plus a margin on the amounts drawn down, and at half the margin for the non-utilised portion of the facility, hence the borrowings are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
The Group then seeks to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in interest rates by entering into derivative financial instruments that reduce the level of exposure to floating rates.
The target of fixed capped debt is defined in the Group Treasury policy and procedures however the amount hedged can be amended subject to agreement by the Finance Committee.
The gross cash flows on the interest rate derivatives are sensitive to changes in interest rates as they are driven by three month LIBOR which is re-set on a quarterly basis.
The weighted average interest rate for these derivative financial instruments is as follows: Weighted average interest rate % Currency: Sterling At 31 December 2010 5.7 At 31 December 2009 6.0 Stock code: PFD www.

It has a callable option whereby the counterparty bank can cancel the swap at nil cost at certain specified dates from June 2011 onwards.
The cap and floor structures have a nominal value of 350m 2009: 350m with caps set at 6.15% to 6.25% and floor rates between 4.31% and 4.55%.
In addition, when LIBOR rates are beneath the floor strike price, a digital option is triggered which results in the Group paying interest at 5.75% on all of these instruments for three months.
In October 2010 the Group restructured all of its five long dated swaps nominal value 400m and its two other callable swaps nominal value 275m into six new fixed rate swaps with a nominal value totalling 675m, all maturing in 2013.
These swaps have an average fixed rate of 6.57% ranging between 4.55% and 9%.
Of these, swaps with a nominal value of 400m have callable options whereby the counterparty bank can cancel the swap at nil cost at certain specified dates, 250m being currently callable and a further 150m becoming callable in September 2011.
The other callable swaps classified as Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise a single swap with an optional break at August 2012 and a mandatory break at June 2013.
The swap was structured to amortise the fair value at 5 March 2009 over the life of the new contract.
In addition a derivative element provides for an adjustment to the payments should interest rates rise above 7%, hence the swap comprises both an underlying host as well as embedded derivatives.
The current fair value as at 31 December 2010 is 32.4m 2009: 36.8m, and based on the current yield curve the mark to market payment in August 2012 would be 29.4m 2009: 32.6m.
To compensate for the shorter maturity date these swaps have fixed bullet payments on maturity totalling 82m.
A portion of this becomes immediately payable up to a maximum of 25% if the Group raises a bond before maturity.
Cash and deposits earn interest at floating rates based on banks short-term treasury deposit rates.
Short-term trade and other receivables are interest-free.
The Groups provisions of 38.9m as at 31 December 2010 2009: 46.9m include 14.1m relating to onerous leases 2009: 16.6m which are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.
These cash flows are discounted where the effect is material.
At 31 December 2010, for every 50 basis points reduction in rates below the last floating reset rate of 0.7575% based on three month LIBOR, with all other variables held constant, annualised net interest expense would decrease by 1.7m 2009: 2.8m increase.
At 31 December 2010, if interest rates were 200 basis points higher than the last floating reset rate of 0.7575% based on three month LIBOR, with all other variables held constant, annualised net interest expense would increase by 6.8m 2009: 11.1m decrease.
The Groups other financial assets and liabilities are not exposed to material interest rate risk.

Financial instruments continued b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality financial institutions and trade receivables are due principally from major grocery retailers though it is the Groups policy to insure trade debt.
At 31 December 2010, trade and other receivables of 49.9m 2009: 31.3m were past due but not impaired.
These relate to customers with whom there is no history of default.
The ageing of trade and other receivables was as follows: Past due Fully performing 130 days 3160 days 6190 days 91120 days 120 days Total m m m m m m m Trade and other receivables 2010 264.5 20.0 3.6 2.5 1.5 22.3 314.4 2009 280.2 17.6 4.3 1.9 1.7 5.8 311.5 At 31 December 2010, trade and other receivables of 9.1m 2009: 7.7m were determined to be specifically impaired and provided for.
The amount of the provision reflects receivables from customers which are considered to be experiencing difficult economic situations.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security against its financial assets.
Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2010 2009 m m At 1 January 7.7 6.0 Receivables written off during the year as uncollectable 3.3 2.4 Provision for receivables released 1.8 Provision for receivables impairment raised 6.5 4.1 At 31 December 9.1 7.7 The Group has benefited from a 90m securitisation programme to allow it to transfer trade receivable balances to one of the Groups primary banks.
This programme also allows the Group to fide-link its own credit rating from that of the underlying assets and achieve a lower cost of funding.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk through both the treasury and finance functions.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared and reviewed on a weekly basis, normally covering a period of three months.
In addition, cash flow forecasts are prepared as part of the Groups overall budgeting and forecasting processes and performance is monitored against this each month.
This is intended to give the Board sufficient forward visibility of debt levels.
The Groups net debt level can vary significantly from month to month and there is some volatility within months.
This reflects trading patterns, timing of receipts from customers and payments to suppliers, patterns of inventory holdings and the timing of the spend on major capital and restructuring projects.
For these reasons the debt levels at the year end date may not be indicative of debt levels at other points throughout the year.

The cash flows above are based on the contractual maturity of the swaps except for one swap within Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss with a nominal value of 150m which is based on an optional break date of August 2012 where the bank can call the swap at its mark to market value.
Furthermore, for the purposes of this table, callable features have been reflected where the yield curve indicates that a counterparty is likely to call or cancel a contract at nil cost to themselves.
We note that no contracts 2009: no contracts are expected to be called at nil prior to their contractual maturity based on the current yield curve.

Financial instruments continued d Fair value The following table shows the carrying amounts which approximate to fair value except as noted below of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Set out below is a summary of methods and assumptions used to value each category of financial instrument.

Hedge accounting has not been applied to forward contracts and as a result the movement in the fair value of 2.2m has been debited to the income statement in the year 2009: 18.6m debit.
Commodity derivatives are marked to market using prevailing prices and are also not designated for hedge accounting.
As a result the fair value movement of 0.2m 2009: 11.7m credit has been credited to the income statement.
Interest rate swaps are marked to market using prevailing market prices.
Interest rate swaps are also not designated for hedge accounting.
As a result the movement in the fair value of 133.7m has been credited to the income statement in the year 2009: 75.5m credit.
Interest rate swaps classed as Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are also marked to market using prevailing market prices.
These are also not designated for hedge accounting.
As a result the movement in the fair value of 177.0m has been charged to the income statement in the year 2009: 36.8m charge.

Financial instruments continued Short and long-term borrowings, loan notes and interest payable Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest rate cash flows.
The fair value of the floating rate debt approximates the carrying value above.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance lease liabilities approximates book value.
Trade and other receivables payables The carrying value of receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to reflect the fair value given their short maturity.
The fair values of non-current receivables payables are also considered to be the same as the carrying value due to the size and nature of the balances involved.

The average lease term is two years, the longest being 7 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, the average effective borrowing rate was 3.9% 2009: 8.2%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date, and thus expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying value.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors title to the leased assets.
f Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may vary the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity plus net debt.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 were as follows: 2010 2009 m m Total borrowings 1,281.9 1,384.5 Less cash and cash equivalents 1.9 19.4 Net borrowings 1,280.0 1,365.1 Total equity 989.5 1,064.9 Total capital 2,269.5 2,430.0 Gearing ratio 56% 56% Under the Groups financing arrangement, the Group is required to meet two covenant tests which are calculated and tested on a 12 month rolling basis at the half year and full year, each year.
The Group has complied with these tests during the year, and at year end.

Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the asset liability arises and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.
In all cases this is 27.0% 2009: 28.0% except for an asset of 0.7m 2009: 1.0m relating to Irish retirement benefit obligations where the local rate of 12.5% has been used.

The remaining provisions largely relate to onerous leases raised in previous years.
Other than onerous lease provisions, which range from 3 to 22 years, it is anticipated that the majority of these provisions will be utilised during 2011.
At 31 December 2009, restructuring and redundancy provisions have been raised in respect of the integration and restructuring of the Groups Irish operations and onerous lease provisions in respect to properties to reflect the current adverse market conditions.
Other than onerous lease provisions, which range from 3 to 23 years, it is anticipated that the majority of these provisions will be utilised during 2010.
Other provisions at 31 December 2010 and 2009 primarily relate to insurance claims and dilapidations against leasehold properties.
The costs relating to dilapidation provisions will be incurred over a number of years in accordance with the length of the leases.
These provisions have been discounted at rates between 4.4% and 5.1%.
The unwinding of the discount is charged to the income statement under interest payable.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes under which employees are entitled to retirement benefits which are based on final salary on retirement.
These are as follows: a Premier schemes The Premier Foods Pension Scheme PFPS was the principal funded defined benefit scheme within the old Premier Group which also operated a smaller funded defined benefit scheme, the Premier Ambient Products Pension Scheme PAPPS for employees acquired with the Ambrosia business in 2001.
As a result of the acquisition of Campbells in 2006, the Group inherited the Premier Grocery Products Pension Scheme PGPPS covering the employees of Campbells UK business, and the Premier Grocery Products Ireland Pension Scheme PGPIPS covering the employees of Campbells Ireland.
The Group also acquired two further schemes with the acquisition of Chivers Ireland in January 2007, the Chivers 1987 Pension Scheme and the Chivers 1987 Supplementary Pension Scheme.
These schemes are presented together below as the Premier schemes.
b RHM schemes As a result of the acquisition of RHM plc, the Group also acquired the RHM Pension Scheme, the Premier Foods Ireland Pension Scheme 1994, the Premier Foods Ireland Van Sales Scheme and the French Termination Indemnity Arrangements.
These schemes are presented together below as the RHM schemes, with the exception of the French Termination Indemnity Arrangements which were disposed of with the speciality bakery businesses during the previous year, and the Premier Foods Ireland Van Sales Scheme which was wound up during the year.
The exchange rates used to translate the overseas euro based schemes are 1.00 1.1584 for the average rate during the year, and 1.00 1.1601 for the closing position at 31 December 2010.
Under all the schemes detailed above, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits which vary as a percentage of final salary on retirement.
The assets of all schemes are held by the trustees of the respective schemes and are independent of the Groups finances.

Retirement benefit schemes continued The schemes invest through investment managers appointed by the trustees in UK and European equities and in investment products made up of a broader range of assets.
The plan assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The pension schemes hold a charge over the assets of the Group.

The issue was structured as a placing and open offer of 1,055,756,006 new ordinary shares at a price of 26 pence per share, and a firm placing of 497,660,770 new ordinary shares at a price of 26 pence per share.
Share option schemes The Company has share option schemes for certain senior executives and key individuals.
The employees involved in the schemes hold options to subscribe for up to 84.4 million ordinary shares of 1 pence each between 2010 and 2014, granted at prices ranging between 1 pence per ordinary share and 186 pence per ordinary share.
The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below.
For 2010, a summary of the Companys schemes is as follows: 1.
The Company adopted an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS at the time of admission for executive directors.
A portion of the options granted under the ESOS have now vested and are exercisable between 3 and 10 years after grant as certain performance criteria have been met.
These options are equity-settled and the number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below.
A Savings Related Share Option Scheme for employees.
The employees involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 63.5 million ordinary shares.
These options are equity-settled, have a maximum term of 3.5 years and generally vest only if employees remain in employment to the vesting date.
A Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for senior managers.
The individuals involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 8.5 million ordinary shares at 1 pence per ordinary share.
The number of shares subject to awards, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be awarded are given below.
These awards are equity-settled and have a maximum term of 3 years.
The performance and vesting conditions of the scheme have been aligned with those of the Co-Investment Plan below.
Since the Company was positioned below the median TSR performance target, the required performance conditions were not met and the 2007 award lapsed in full in April 2010.

Reserves and Share capital continued 4.
A Co-Investment Plan CIP for directors and senior managers.
The scheme is structured as a share matching plan and the individuals involved in the scheme are required to commit and retain a significant amount of capital in the form of Premier Foods shares.
The vesting of matching awards is conditional on achievement against a combination of EPS and TSR performance targets.
During the year the performance conditions were not met and so the 2007 CIP award lapsed in full.
As set out in the Directors remuneration report the Company is proposing to adopt new Executive remuneration arrangements in 2011 and no further awards are expected under either the CIP or LTIP.
During the previous year, the Group modified its outstanding share option and award schemes following the placing and open offer and firm placing in March 2009.
The Group decreased the exercise price by 4.87% for certain schemes and increased the number of share options awards for all schemes by 5.12%.
The incremental fair value granted resulting from these modifications was 0.2m increase in charge over the remaining vesting periods of the schemes.
The incremental fair value granted was measured using pricing models consistent with the Groups other schemes.

The legal position and the potential methods of calculation of the liability is, as yet, uncertain.
