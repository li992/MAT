Also included is 21.0 million in relation to the UK decontamination business which continues to incur significant losses.
The tax credit on this is 3.8 million 2009: nil.
A 9.9 million onerous contract provision has been provided for the losses we expect to incur until the decontamination contracts reach a financially sustainable position over the next four years.
The provision is expected to be utilised principally over the next two years.
The tax credit on this is 2.7 million.
In addition, pre-contract and commissioning costs associated with the decontamination contracts have been written off.
The tax credit on this is 1.0 million.
The restructuring costs relate primarily to our German healthcare business where we closed a loss making plant at Glckstadt, near Hamburg following the loss of a significant contract.
We have also incurred restructuring costs following the acquisitions of the ISS mats business in Norway.
The tax credit on these is 2.1 million 2009: 3.0 million.
The group incurred costs of 1.4 million associated with the implementation of its strategic review announced in November 2010.
This includes 0.6 million of restructuring costs incurred in the Irish flat linen business which is being realigned with the new strategic priorities.
The tax credit on these costs is 0.4 million.
Acquisition costs of 1.1 million have been expensed to the income statement in line with IFRS 3 revised.
These would previously have been accounted for as part of the business combination.
The tax credit on these was 0.4 million.
On 22nd December 2010, the group disposed of Bjrnklder, the Swedish direct sales business for a profit of 11.4 million.
The tax charge incurred is 0.2 million.
Following the UK Governments announcement in summer 2010, the inflation index to be used to derive statutory pension increase has been changed from the Retail Prices Index RPI to the Consumer Prices Index CPI.
Due to a number of differences between the indices, CPI is expected to be less than RPI over the long-term which means that the Scheme liabilities have reduced.
The reduction has been recognised as a negative past service cost of 7.0 million.
The tax charge on this is 2.0 million.
During the year a net profit has been realised on property disposals in Sweden and the UK.
The tax charge on this is nil 2009: credit of 0.4 million.
The amendment to the past service cost has been recognised in Administrative expenses.
All other exceptional items have been recorded in other income or other expenses respectively.

The Finance No 2 Act 2010, which was substantively enacted on 20th July 2010, includes legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1st April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1st April 2014.
These further changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 27% to 24%, if these are applied to the deferred tax balance at 31st December 2010, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by approximately 0.5 million.

During the year, goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
As a result, an impairment charge of 34.1 million 2009: 6.0 million was made and is shown in other operating expenses in the income statement.
The components of the impairment charge are explained below.

The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates and use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the groups current three-year strategic plan.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period have been generally extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2%2.25% depending upon the CGU and are appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The main assumptions on which forecast cash flows have been based are revenue and operating margin growth.
The growth rates used are consistent with the long-term average growth rates for the industry.
Projected cash flows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates of 11%13% depending upon the CGU 2009: weighted average pre-tax rate of 11%17%.
The discount rates have been revised to reflect the latest market assumptions for the Risk Free-rates and Equity Risk Premiums and also to take into account the net cost of debt.
Impairment tests are carried out annually, or when indicators show that assets may be impaired.
The UK Decontamination business continues to incur significant losses and as a result the goodwill associated with this business has been impaired.
The group has recognised an impairment charge of 24.3 million comprising a full write down of the goodwill 21.0 million and written off capitalised pre-contract and commissioning costs 3.3 million.
No other class of assets have been impaired, as their carrying values are supported by their value in use.
The discount rate used for the Decontamination CGU is 11% 2009: 11%.
If key assumptions in respect of sales and profit margin growth are not achieved then further write down may be necessary.
For the impact of reasonable possible changes in the discount rate, sales and profit margin growth assumptions refer to the key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty on page 82.
In addition the German healthcare business has lost significant contract volume over the last two years in difficult market conditions and therefore we have impaired 13.1 million of goodwill associated with this business No other class of assets have been impaired, as their carrying values are supported by their value in use.
The discount rate used for the CGU is 11% 2009: 11%.
The key assumptions used for the value-in-use calculation are as follows: Revenue growth in excess of long term growth rate achieved for the next two years.
Operating margins continue to increase for the next 4 years.
The pre-tax discount rate used for the CGU is 11%.
If the above revenue and margin assumptions are not achieved then an impairment of goodwill may become necessary.
The annual impairment tests carried out have resulted in a total impairment charge of 34.1 million 2009: 6.0 million resulting in the carrying value of goodwill being written down to its recoverable amount.
Both of these have been previously disclosed in the accounts as having limited headroom between the carrying value and future cash flow forecasts.

indd 98 02 03 2011 02:37 Business review Governance Financial statements Investors 99 16 Derivative financial instruments continued Background The group has in issue a number of derivative contracts to reduce the interest rate exposure on its revolving credit facility: In January 2007, the group swapped a notional principal of 55 million from floating to fixed rates and the two swaps entered into have been designated as cash flow hedges.
In January 2008, a notional principal amount of DKK 400 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
In September 2008, a notional principal amount of SEK 300 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
The swap entered into has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
The group has in issue US$509 million and 25 million long term senior guarantee notes under private placements in the US.
In May 2006 the group placed US$250 million at fixed rates for periods between 8 and 12 years and in December 2009 the group undertook a further placement of US$259 million and 25 million at fixed rates between 7 and 12 years.
In both placements the foreign currency amounts were immediately swapped into other currencies: Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
This is to offset the foreign exchange rate exposure arising on the groups foreign currency assets.
The conversion from US dollars into currency was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
All of these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges, with the exception of one swap from the 2006 placement, which has been designated as a fair value hedge.
In the second stage further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The fixed interest rate cross currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
During the year in accordance with group policy, the group entered into several forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars in the future at fixed rates.
These forward contracts reduce the foreign exchange exposure on the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
Cash flow hedges The interest rate swaps have resulted in the recognition of a derivative liability of 6.5 million.
At 31st December 2010 the fixed interest rates vary from 3.11% to 4.54%, the floating euro rate being EURIBOR, the floating Danish krone rate being CIBOR and the floating Swedish krona rate being STIBOR.
The blended rate for the group on this amount is 2.9%.
Of the US$509 million private placements US$459 million was swapped into fixed rates via sterling swaps.
The fixed rate on the US private placements which has been swapped varies from 4.92% to 5.66%.
The derivative asset recognised on these 15 instruments is 29.3 million.
The exchange component of this derivative movement has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 4.1 million loss.
The remaining 16.4 million gain has been taken to the hedging reserve and will be continuously released to the income statement until the repayment of the private placement.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have resulted in the recognition of a derivative liability of 0.3 million 2009: asset 0.2 million and liability of 0.3 million.
During the year 0.2 million was recognised in equity and 0.2 million was removed from equity and included in the carrying amount of the textiles and capital equipment purchased with the US dollars.
This equity transfer will then be recognised in the income statement in line with the hedged transaction.
Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31st December 2010 the fixed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.26% and 5.57% on the fixed European swaps.
The floating Danish krone swap varies against CIBOR.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.
The movement on the derivative liability arising has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 8.2 million profit.
The groups borrowings under its revolving credit facilities are designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31st December 2010 was 243.8 million 2009: 399.0 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 5.6 million on translation is taken to reserves as a component part of currency translation.
The swaps used in relation to this hedge have a maturity of between two and five years with no contractual re-pricing.
Fair value hedges US$50 million of the 2006 US private placement was swapped into a floating Danish krone 309.1 million, via a sterling swap.
The sterling swap is dealt with as a fair value hedge.
The ineffective portion of the fair value hedge resulted in a loss of 136,432 2009: profit 119,573.
The fair value hedge has resulted in the recognition of a 7.3 million derivative asset.

The groups overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Finance Director under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Finance Director identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
The group policy is to enter forward contracts to purchase US dollars based upon the expected purchases.
These derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges.
The groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profit to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investment in overseas net assets.
During 2010 and 2009, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: As at 31st December 2010 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 15.2 43.9 25.9 18.7 8.5 112.2 Bank overdrafts 6.5 13.6 6.8 11.3 38.2 Net cash and cash equivalents note 13 8.7 30.3 19.1 18.7 2.8 74.0 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 67.3 57.2 332.7 46.0 101.4 604.6 Finance lease liabilities 5.9 0.1 3.2 0.4 9.6 Pre-derivative position 64.5 27.0 332.7 26.9 85.9 3.2 540.2 Derivative effect 214.0 332.7 56.5 60.1 2.1 Net debt position 64.5 241.0 83.4 146.0 3.2 538.1 As at 31st December 2009 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 15.3 193.6 19.4 15.2 32.8 276.3 Bank overdrafts 2.7 1.3 0.1 4.1 Net cash and cash equivalents note 13 15.3 190.9 18.1 15.1 32.8 272.2 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 23.6 232.3 322.4 48.4 120.9 747.6 Finance lease liabilities 5.7 0.2 3.2 0.4 9.5 Pre-derivative position 14.0 41.6 322.4 30.3 109.0 32.4 484.9 Derivative effect 0.1 224.9 322.4 55.4 63.0 20.8 Net debt position 13.9 266.5 85.7 172.0 32.4 505.7 The exposure to euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone largely relate to our net investment hedge activities as described and shown in note 16.
indd 100 02 03 2011 02:37 Business review Governance Financial statements Investors 101 17 Financial risk management continued ii Price risk The group is not exposed to any equity securities or commodities price risk.
iii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at floating rates.
The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2010 and 2009, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in Sterling, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
As at 31st December 2010, the group has the following swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt: 55 million, DKK 400 million and SEK 300 million.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of fixed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: As at As at 31st December 31st December 2010 2009 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 3.1 3.2 In more than one year, but not more than two years 3.6 3.2 In more than two years but not more than five years 42.2 3.3 In more than five years 321.5 348.4 370.4 358.1 Floating interest rate borrowings 243.8 399.0 Total borrowings 614.2 757.1 During 2010 and 2009, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31st December 2010 As at 31st December 2009 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 74.0 74.0 180.0 92.2 272.2 Borrowings 370.4 243.8 614.2 358.1 399.0 757.1 Pre-derivative position 370.4 169.8 540.2 178.1 306.8 484.9 Derivative effect note i 222.8 225.2 2.4 253.7 233.0 20.7 Net debt position 593.2 55.4 537.8 431.8 73.8 505.6 i Excludes the forward foreign exchange contract derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical areas.
If there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account, its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2009, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 255.8 million 2009: 428.6 million.
The group does not hold any collateral as security.

Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities note 15 at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.
Such forecasting takes into consideration the groups debt financing plans, covenant compliance, and compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets.
The table below analyses the groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relative maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contract maturity date.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2009.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
indd 102 02 03 2011 02:37 Business review Governance Financial statements Investors 103 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: financial derivatives in net investment hedging relationship will not influence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: and changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.
The following table shows the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk as at 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2009, which is a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
The foreign exchange risk is naturally hedged against the net assets of our operations in Continental Europe.
All foreign exchange on both the borrowings and net assets is taken to reserves where it will offset.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital or reduce debt.
The group manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans.
Such measures include its net interest cover and leverage ratios, which are included in its banking covenants.
The group continues to remain compliant with all its banking covenants.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.

Restructuring Restructuring provisions comprise largely of employee termination payments and are not recognised for future operating losses.
Property disposals The group has outstanding warranties, indemnities and guarantees given previously on a number of properties operated by businesses which have been disposed.
The majority of these expire in 2017 with the remaining expiring by 2022.
Onerous contract provision A provision for 9.9 million has been recognised for the two decontamination contracts which are considered to be onerous.
The provision will be utilised principally over the next two years.

Shares in relation to the award will be released to participants at the end of a three-year performance period, dependent upon the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied.
The 2010 and 2009 awards were valued using the Black-Scholes model.
Previous awards were valued using the Monte-Carlo model.
For each award, the group established a comparator group of other companies from the FTSE Mid 250 Investment funds excluded.
The expected volatility under this model was based on the daily movement of total shareholder return over the three years prior to the grant.
The correlation figure shown is the average against all other companies movements in total shareholder return in the comparator group.

Defined benefit plans Within the United Kingdom, the group principally operates a registered defined benefit scheme The Davis Service Group Retirement Benefits Scheme.
There was a triennial valuation in February 2010.
In 2010 6 million was contributed to the fund, with a further 5 million planned in 2011.
Overseas, the only significant defined benefit pension arrangements are the defined benefit scheme operated in Ireland and unfunded schemes within Sweden, Germany and Norway.
Under such schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall surplus on the funded plans is 20.3 million of which 22.5 million surplus is in respect of the main UK plan.
There is a deficit of 23.9 million on unfunded plans.
Where a defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
The actuarial valuations of the principal scheme, together with eight other defined benefit schemes operated by the group have each been updated as at 31st December 2010 by qualified actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2010 2009 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.4 4.2 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.2 3.2 Discount rate 5.3 5.5 Inflation rate RPI 3.2 3.2 Inflation rate CPI 2.6 n a Expected return on plan assets Equities 8.2 8.3 Bonds 4.7 4.8 Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and other investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
