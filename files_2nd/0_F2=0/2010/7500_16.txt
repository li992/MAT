General inFormation Homeserve plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the companies act 1985. the address of the registered office is cable Drive, Walsall Ws2 7bn.
these financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
2. siGniFicant accoUntinG policies basis of accounting the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with iFrss, adopted by the european Union and therefore comply with article 4 of the eU ias regulation.
adoption of new or revised standards and accounting policies in the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements.
Standards affecting presentation and disclosure ias1 revised 2007 presentation of Financial statements: ias1 revised 2007 requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
as a result, a statement of changes in equity has been included in the primary statements, showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position amendment to ias38 intangible assets: ias38 has been amended to state that an entity is permitted to recognise a prepayment asset for advertising or promotional expenditure only up to the point at which the entity has the right to access the goods purchased or up to the point of receipt of the services.
in the past Homeserve has recognised inventories of brochures as an asset up to the date of dispatch to the customer.
the adoption of this amendment has not resulted in any significant impact on these financial statements.
standards in issue but not yet effective at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: amendments to iFrs2 Jun 2009 Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions iFrs3 revised Jan 2008 business combinations iFrs9 Financial instruments ias24 revised nov 2009 related party Disclosures amendments to ias27 Jan 2008 consolidated and separate Financial statements amendment to ias32 oct 2009 classification of rights issues amendments to iFric14 nov 2009 prepayments of a minimum Funding requirement iFric17 Distributions of non-cash assets to owners iFric18 transfers of assets from customers iFric19 extinguishing Financial liabilities with equity instruments improvements to iFrss 2009 apr 2009 improvements to iFrss 2009 the Directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for iFrs3 revised 2008, whereby acquisition costs and adjustments to contingent consideration will be charged or credited to the income statement.
iFrs3 revised is expected to apply to the Group for the year ending 31 march 2011. the financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments, and on a going concern basis as set out in the corporate governance statement.
Homeserve 76 Financial statements annual report & accounts 2010 notes to tHe Financial statements year enDeD 31 marcH 2010 2. siGniFicant accoUntinG policies continUeD the principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company made up to 31 march each year.
control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
on acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
all intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
investments in joint ventures the Groups share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting.
the Groups share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet, including associated goodwill.
based on the guidance of ias28 investments in associates, provision for the Groups share of the joint venture losses are not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets below zero.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
if the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
an impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
on disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to iFrss has been retained at the previous UK Gaap amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK Gaap prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
revenue recognition revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, vat and other sales related taxes.
77 revenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Groups role as an intermediary in the policy sale and administration process.
any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Groups role is only as an intermediary in the cash collection process, are not included in revenue.
consequently, revenue consists of a component of the overall policy price, representing the commission receivable for the marketing and sale of the policy, stated net of insurance premium tax.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration services.
in these situations, a proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income.
the assessment of future claims handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through experience of historic actual costs.
the deferred revenue is released over the expected profile of anticipated claims over the policy period.
the deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the performance of these services in the future.
revenue on sales to franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete.
revenue on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise agreement.
these franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
leasing leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
all other leases are classified as operating leases.
assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
at each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
on consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
borrowing costs borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
operating profit operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures net of tax but before investment income and finance costs.
Homeserve 78 Financial statements annual report & accounts 2010 notes to tHe Financial statements year enDeD 31 marcH 2010 2. siGniFicant accoUntinG policies continUeD retirement benefit costs payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
they are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
taxation the tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
the Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
79 Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: buildings 2550 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 7 years computer equipment 37 years motor vehicles 3 years with 25% residual value assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
intangible assets intangible assets arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business are stated at their fair value and are amortised over their useful lives, using the straight line method, as follows: customer relationships 37 years customer databases 310 years Franchise assets 315 years trademarks and similar access rights, acquired on an exclusive use basis from third party commercial partners, are also treated as intangible assets.
these assets are recorded at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over the length of the contractual agreement up to a maximum of 20 years.
computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised over their useful lives of three to seven years.
impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill at each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
if the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
an impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
cost is measured on a first-in, first-out FiFo basis.
net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Homeserve 80 Financial statements annual report & accounts 2010 notes to tHe Financial statements year enDeD 31 marcH 2010 2. siGniFicant accoUntinG policies continUeD Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
trade receivables trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
borrowings interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Hedge accounting the Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as cash flow hedges.
at the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement and is included within finance costs.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is also recognised in the income statement in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
trade payables trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
equity instruments equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
share-based payments the Group has applied the requirements of iFrs2 share-based payments.
in accordance with the transitional provision, iFrs2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 november 2002 that were unvested as of 1 april 2005.
81 the Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
the fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
the Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Groups ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through save as you earn schemes.
Fair value is measured by use of the black-scholes model or monte carlo simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
own shares reserve shares of the parent company that are purchased by the Homeserve plc employee benefit trust are held at cost and shown as a deduction in equity.
cost comprises consideration paid, including directly attributable costs.
the shares are held to satisfy obligations under the share option schemes.
JUDGements anD estimation Uncertainty revenue recognition an appropriate proportion of revenue is deferred to future periods when the Group has obligations extending to future periods.
as a result, judgement is required in assessing the extent and associated costs of fulfilling those future obligations.
the Group uses historical experience and forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and how much to defer to future periods.
impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets the annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated.
as a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
Following the annual impairment review, an impairment charge of nil 2009: 59,179,000 has been recorded against goodwill and nil 2009: 16,965,000 against acquisition intangibles.
as set out in note 14, reasonably possible changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices and margins can impact the recoverable value.
pensions the Group participates in a defined benefit retirement scheme for certain employees.
the scheme assets and liabilities are valued by an independent qualified actuary using the assumptions summarised in note 39. as required by ias19, the value of the defined benefit obligation has been measured using the projected unit credit method which requires the use of judgement and estimation.
4. revenUe restatement the Directors have concluded that commissions payable to third parties should be shown gross within revenue and operating costs.
this change in accounting policy has resulted in an increase in both revenue and operating costs of 23,300,000 2009: 20,400,000. an analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: restated 2010 2009 000 000 Continuing operations provision of services 379,190 304,281 investment income note 9 191 1,237 379,381 305,518 Discontinued operations provision of services 81,983 233,601 461,364 539,119 Homeserve 82 Financial statements annual report & accounts 2010 notes to tHe Financial statements year enDeD 31 marcH 2010 5. bUsiness anD GeoGrapHical seGments segment revenues and results iFrs8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.

the recoverable amounts of the cGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
the key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cGUs.
the growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
the Group prepares annual cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Directors and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated long-term growth rate of 2.5% 2009: 2.5% representing long-term growth rates based in respective country GDp rates.
the pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all cGUs is 11.2% 2009: 11.3%.
89 the Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each cGUs carrying value, the key assumptions are as noted above.
management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
this view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, takes account of the headroom in managements internal growth targets verses the conservative growth estimates used in the impairment review.

this assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
in the prior year, an impairment of 7,152,000 was included to recognise the surplus of the UK emergency services assets impairment against the pre-impairment carrying value of the non-current assets, for certain cash generating units within the division.
no such amounts have been recognised in the current year.

there are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 4,176,000 2009: 21,187,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
the Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

the concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

93 other receivables as part of our activities, the Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for components such as underwriting fees and insurance premium tax.
the concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
in addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included in other creditors.
cash balances and cash equivalents cash balances and cash equivalents of 25,409,000 2009: 21,345,000 comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

the awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche.
the number of awards vesting is dependent upon the profit before tax of the Group for the year ended 31 march 2008 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 march 2009. if the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.

to manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps for certain periods, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
these swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is provided in the table below.
interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities and loan notes.
Deferred and contingent consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows, before discounting.

it is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
the majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
as a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and investment in joint ventures, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
the Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
the risk associated with the investment in joint ventures is mitigated through the close management and regular review of the performance of the assets.
the Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Groups board which sets the framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
the Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
included in note 22 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, all of the Groups financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms.
