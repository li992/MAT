120 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2010 Shareholder information Payment of dividends The Company declares its dividends in US dollars.
As a result of the shareholders being mainly UK based, dividends will be paid in sterling, but if you would like to receive your dividend in US dollars please contact the Registrars at the address below.
