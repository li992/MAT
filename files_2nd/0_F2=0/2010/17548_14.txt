Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups Long-term Incentive Plan.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

78 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 Financial statements Notes continued Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined from value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash ow projections based on financial plans approved by management covering a five-year period in developed markets and longer in underdeveloped markets, reecting the need to develop brand awareness and to increase market penetration.
Cash ows beyond the periods of the approved plans are extrapolated using the long-term growth rates stated below.
The carrying value of goodwill after impairments and the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations were as follows: Detail by CGU Chile Peru Argentina Spain US UK 2010 Carrying value of goodwill millions 76.6 44.9 39.0 274.5 1,771.5 1,011.8 Terminal growth rate 3.6% 3.8% 2.5% 2.1% 2.0% 1.8% Pre-tax discount rate 11.7% 13.9% 20.7% 11.9% 11.6% 11.8% 2009 Carrying value of goodwill millions 73.0 42.9 43.2 284.6 1,873.7 1,011.8 Terminal growth rate 3.0% 2.2% 6.6% 2.5% 2.0% 1.8% Pre-tax discount rate 13.7% 15.9% 25.7% 11.6% 11.6% 11.9% The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to changes in the long-term growth rates and discount rates.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts of long-term national growth rates included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are based on estimated weighted average costs of capital in each country before tax and reect specic risks relating to the relevant segments.
At 31 March 2010, the calculated recoverable value of the operations in the UK and US would have to decrease by 56% and 23% before the associated goodwill would be impaired.
Impairment in the US could occur if the terminal growth rates and annual growth rates in the plan all fell by at least 1.7 percentage points or if the discount rate increased by at least 1.8 percentage points.
Results in the UK would have to be in significant permanent decline before the associated goodwill would be impaired, and any change in the estimated UK weighted average costs of capital of the magnitude needed to cause impairment would be oset by other factors.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, impairment losses of 1,103.9 million, 120.1 million, 40.8 million and 7.5 million on goodwill in relation to our operations in Spain, Chile, Argentina and Peru, respectively, were determined during our tests for impairment.
Financial plans for all our operations were reduced during the 2009 tests of impairment to reect the ever deepening economic recessions in Europe and the US and expectations for the recession to spread to Latin America.
This reduction was the main cause of the impairments in Spain and Chile.
At 31 March 2010, the calculated recoverable value of the operations in Spain, Chile, Argentina and Peru would have to decrease by 19%, 36%, 28% and 58%, respectively, before the associated goodwill would be impaired.
Impairment in Spain could occur if the terminal growth rates and annual growth rates in the plan all fell by at least 1.5 percentage points or if the discount rate increased by at least 1.6 percentage points.
Impairment in Chile could occur if the terminal growth rates and annual growth rates in the plan all fell by at least 2.7 percentage points or if the discount rate increased by at least 2.8 percentage points.
Impairment in Argentina could occur if the terminal growth rates and annual growth rates in the plan all fell by at least 11.9 percentage points or if the discount rate increased by at least 13.8 percentage points.
Impairment in Peru could occur if the terminal growth rates and annual growth rates in the plan all fell by at least 2.5 percentage points or if the discount rate increased by at least 2.6 percentage points.

Movements in the fair values of derivative financial instruments designated as cash ow hedges to the extent they are eective are recognised in equity and will be recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transactions are settled.
The Company has net inter-company receivables of 1,005.5 million 2009 650.7 million, all denominated in sterling.
Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 85 Notes continued 15.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Borrowings in currencies other than pounds sterling are hedges of investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
Movements in the fair value of these financial instruments to the extent they are eective are recognised in equity.
The fair value of loans is split by currency as follows: GBP 722.8 million 2009 676.8 million : US dollars 1,171.5 million 2009 1,097.1 million : Euro: 660.8 million 2009 611.5 million : total 2,555.1 million 2009 2,385.4 million.
The cash ow hedges are linked to the interest on the external borrowings whose maturity proles are shown below.
The ineective portion of interest rate hedges and foreign exchange hedges recognised in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2010 amounted to nil 2009 nil.
There was no ineectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges.
More detail on the Groups accounting for financial instruments is included in the Groups accounting policies on pages 63 to 70.
Currency prole and interest rate risk The interest rate prole of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, after taking into account interest rate swaps, is as follows: At 31 March 2010 a Financial liabilities Net financial Financial assets liabilities millions oating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Total assets Currency Sterling 135.5 926.3 23.9 950.2 814.7 US dollar 8.5 1,489.2 65.5 1,554.7 1,546.2 Euro 2.5 763.5 73.4 836.9 833.7 b Latin American currencies 13.9 13.9 Total 160.4 3,179.0 162.8 3,341.8 3,180.7 At 31 March 2009 a Financial liabilities Net financial Financial assets liabilities millions oating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Total assets Currency Sterling 5.9 1,100.0 131.8 1,231.8 1,225.9 US dollar 19.1 1,950.7 43.0 1,993.7 1,974.6 Euro 0.7 1,026.4 55.3 1,081.7 1,081.0 b Latin American currencies 25.4 25.4 Total 51.1 4,077.1 230.1 4,307.2 4,256.1 a Financial liabilities are presented gross before unamortised finance costs which amount to 86.8 million at 31 March 2010 48.9 million at 31 March 2009.

The Group expects to continue to x or cap its oating rate financial liabilities at the end of each month by reference to one month LIBOR or EURIBOR at that time.
Borrowing facilities and liquidity risk We manage our liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash ow forecasts.
The Group has maintained committed banking facilities to mitigate any liquidity risk it may face.
There were committed senior debt facilities at 31 March 2010 and 2009 of 196.8 million and 400 million, respectively, of which nil million had been drawn down at 31 March 2010 2009 40.3 million.
Details of related debt covenants and the management of the risks associated with meeting those covenants are set out in our risk management disclosures on pages 22 to 24.
The following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash ows payable calculated using forward spot interest rates : the carrying values and the fair values of Group borrowings at the balance sheet date.
The Group also has short-term receivables and payables that arise in the normal course of business and these are not included in the following table.
Any cash ows based on oating rate interest are based on interest rates prevailing at 31 March in the relevant year.
All derivative amounts are shown gross, although amounts are settled net wherever possible.
The fair values of borrowings are based on clean market prices at year end or, where these are not available, on the quoted prices of comparable debt issued by other companies.
Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 87 Notes continued 15.
This discount rate has been used to derive the present value of contractually scheduled interest and principal payments.
At 31 March 2009 the fair value was determined by reference to secondary market prices.
b The final payment for tranche A is due 30 April 2011 and the final maturity date for tranche B is 29 October 2012. c The final payment for tranche A is due 30 April 2014 and the final maturity date for tranche B is 31 July 2014. d 193.2 million of the Groups revolving credit facilities is committed until 30 April 2014.
3.6 million is committed until 27 April 2011. e The critical terms of all the Groups interest rate swaps precisely match the terms of the underlying oating rate debt obligations.
The Groups interest rate swaps are designated as cash ow hedges and accordingly amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income and cash ow statements at the same time as the interest is recognised and paid on the underlying hedged debt.
Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 89 Notes continued 16.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Groups approach to management of financial risks together with sensitivity analysis is set out on pages 25 to 29.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging future oating interest rate movements on its term bank debt.
The Group has xed or capped interest rates on around 95% of the interest rate exposure on the indebtedness under the senior credit facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to September 2010, around 70% thereafter to December 2011 and around 50% to December 2012.
The Group has also entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge known cross-border cash ows early in the next financial year.
The hedges give rise to the following balances reported on the balance sheet: At 31 March 2010 2009 Book Fair Book Fair a a millions value value value value b Derivatives Interest rate caps Non-current assets 6.2 6.2 Foreign exchange contracts Current assets 1.9 1.9 0.6 0.6 Current liabilities 0.6 0.6 1.7 1.7 Interest rate swaps Current liabilities 97.2 97.2 63.2 63.2 Non-current liabilities 7.4 7.4 141.4 141.4 a The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced liquidation or sale.
b The gross notional amount of interest rate swaps and caps was 11.5 billion xing rates on average for 191 days 2009 14.6 billion xing rates on average for 170 days and the gross notional amount of foreign exchange contracts was 223.8 million 2009 33.4 million.
The carrying value of the above derivative financial instruments equals their fair value.
Fair values are derived using observable market data.
The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to derivative financial instruments at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
The Group has reviewed all its material contracts for embedded derivatives, for which separate accounting would be required, and has concluded that there are no material embedded derivatives.
Trade and other receivables At 31 March Group Company millions 2010 2009 2010 2009 Amounts falling due within one year Net trade receivables 817.7 1,017.2 Other receivables 25.0 28.2 Accrued income 36.7 53.2 Prepayments 20.0 21.2 0.1 Corporate income tax recoverable 5.7 13.0 905.1 1,132.8 0.1 Amounts falling due after more than one year Amounts owed by Group undertakings 1,005.5 650.7 Total trade and other receivables 905.1 1,132.8 1,005.6 650.7 90 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 Financial statements Notes continued Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and generally have terms of between thirty days and ten months.
Due to their short maturities and the non-interest bearing nature of these financial assets, the fair value of trade and other receivables approximates their book value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large, geographically diverse and unrelated.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, other than recoverable taxation, are denominated in the following currencies, which are the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries.
We do not have any other significant exposure to currency risk on these amounts.
At 31 March Group Company millions 2010 2009 2010 2009 Sterling 222.3 266.9 1,005.6 650.7 US dollar 427.7 566.7 a Euro 249.4 286.2 Total receivables 899.4 1,119.8 1,005.6 650.7 a Latin American currencies represent an insignicant amount and are included within the eurozone values.
The carrying amounts of the Groups trade receivables and accrued income are stated after deducting a provision of 214.6 million at 31 March 2010 2009 205.4 million for doubtful debts and sales allowances.
The carrying amount of the Companys receivable from group undertakings is stated after deducting a provision of 22.2 million at 31 March 2010 2009 22.2 million.
A provision for uncollectible trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The provision is calculated by estimating future cash ows from trade receivables on the basis of historical loss experience.
A receivable is written o against the provision when it is believed to be entirely uncollectible.
Any monies recovered subsequent to write o are recorded as adjustments to the bad debt provision and considered in the local historical loss experience.
The movements in the provision for doubtful debts were as follows for the years ended 31 March 2010 and 2009: Group Company millions 2010 2009 2010 2009 At beginning of year 205.4 199.6 22.2 Charged to income statement 161.9 134.6 22.2 Write os and exchange movement 152.7 128.8 Balance at 31 March 214.6 205.4 22.2 22.2 The Company has no trade receivables.
The gross receivables of 1,027.8 million in the Company are not considered to be past due.
Trade receivables can become impaired, generally when customers are in financial distress, before being considered uncollectible.
Trade receivables are considered impaired only after completion of collection processes designed locally to collect monies from slow payers or, if earlier, when amounts are more than one year past due.
At 31 March 2010, the carrying value and estimated recoverable amount of trade receivables past due and impaired was 5.5 million 2009 1.1 million, after deducting the related provision of 91.1 million 2009 77.3 million for doubtful debts.

At 31 March 2010, gross trade receivables of 209.2 million 2009 264.4 million were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of these gross trade receivables is as follows: At 31 March millions 2010 2009 Up to one month past due 71.8 79.9 One to three months past due 56.5 80.2 Three to nine months past due 58.8 84.2 Over nine months past due 22.1 20.1 Total gross receivables past due but not impaired 209.2 264.4 Trade receivables not yet due of 726.5 million 2009 876.5 million have a provision of 44.6 million 2009 29.7 million set against them.
The Group does not hold any collateral security.
The credit quality of trade receivables past due but not impaired is assessed using a statistical approach to determine the historical allowance rate for each ageing tranche.
This allowance rate is then applied to the debt tranches at the end of the reporting period and a provision for doubtful debts recognised.

Loans, other borrowings and net debt We manage the capital requirements of the Group by maintaining leverage of the Group within the terms of our debt facilities agreement.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are: To safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders.
To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistently with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the debt-to-profit ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt profit.
Net debt is calculated as total debt as shown in the balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Adjusted profit is dened by lending institutions in our Facilities Agreement.
Our new bank facilities became eective on 30 November 2009 and are committed until 2014.
The terms of the new Facilities Agreement contain covenants over net cash interest cover and debt cover.
The net cash interest cover covenant requires that the ratio of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA as dened in the Facilities Agreement, including a pro forma adjustment to the EBITDA for acquisitions of less than one year for the latest twelve-month period to net cash interest payable for the latest twelve-month period does not fall below specic threshold ratios at specic test dates.
The debt cover covenant requires that the ratio of net debt at the testing date to adjusted EBITDA for the latest twelve-month period should not exceed specic threshold ratios at specic test dates.
Details of these ratios and the management of the risks associated with meeting the requirements are set out in our risk management disclosures on pages 22 to 24.

These term loans were renanced under a new Facilities Agreement dated 30 November 2009, which also includes a revolving credit facility of 196.8 million.
At 31 March 2010, nil million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility 2009 40.3 million.
The term loans and the revolving credit facility under the new Facilities Agreement are secured by guarantees given by the Groups principal operating and holding companies and by pledges over the shares of principal operating or holding companies.

Due to their short maturities, the fair value of trade and other payables approximates their book value.
The eect of discounting has been considered for payables falling due after more than one year, and the dierence between fair value and book value is not material, therefore the fair value approximates their book value.

Yell Pension Plan YPP Dened benefit sections There are three dened benefit sections of the YPP, which have been closed to new entrants since 1 October 2001.
The scheme oers both pensions in retirement and death benets to members.
The full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2008, updated to 31 March 2010, showed an obligation of 63.3 million.
Pension benets are based on years of qualifying service and final pensionable salary.
Net obligation The YPP net obligation at the balance sheet date represents the present value of scheme liabilities net of the fair value of assets held to fund future benefit payments, as follows: At 31 March millions 2010 2009 Fair value of plan assets 375.3 274.3 Present value of scheme liabilities 438.6 296.2 Net obligation 63.3 21.9 96 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 Financial statements Notes continued The following table explains the changes in the net obligation: Year ended 31 March millions 2010 2009 Net obligation surplus at beginning of year 21.9 14.0 Movement in year: Current service cost 9.7 15.1 Contributions 32.9 19.3 Termination benets 1.2 8.2 Finance cost 4.6 0.3 Actuarial loss 58.8 31.6 Net obligation at 31 March 63.3 21.9 As the scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost per employee member will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The level of contributions is based on the current service costs and the expected future cash ows of the scheme.
The Group is required to agree its contributions to the plan with the trustees based on actuarial advice.
Such agreement must be reached in a way which complies with the UK Pensions Regulators Scheme Specic Funding guidance.
Any failure to agree would result in the intervention of the Pensions Regulator and, possibly, an imposed settlement.
The Group made contributions for the nine-month period ended 31 December 2008 at the agreed rate of 23.6% of pensionable earnings.
Subsequent to 31 December 2008, the Group agreed to increase the contribution rate to 29.8% of pensionable earnings inclusive of expenses and life assurance premiums, but exclusive of the Pension Protection Fund levy.
Additionally, with eect from 1 January 2009, the Group agreed to pay contributions totalling 58 million, spread equally over 51 monthly payments, to repair the deficit of 47.6 million plus interest reported in the full actuarial funding valuation at 5 April 2008.
The next evaluation of future contribution rates will be after the next full funding valuation, which is expected to have an eective date of 5 April 2011.
Contributions of 26.4 million 2009 16.5 million, plus 6.5 million 2009 2.8 million in respect of benefit augmentations were made in the year.
Plan participants may accept a reduction in their salary in return for non-contributory membership of the plan, the reduction being equal to the contributions otherwise payable.
The Group makes contributions of a corresponding amount, which have been included in the numbers above.
In the years ended 31 March 2010 and 2009, these amounted to 2.0 million 5.5% of pensionable earnings and 2.5 million 5.4% of pensionable earnings, respectively.
Total contributions in financial year 2011 are expected to be around 26 million.
Valuation assumptions The YPP net obligations at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, were based on the valuation at 5 April 2008 updated to 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009 respectively.
The updated valuations carried out by professionally qualied independent actuaries used the following key assumptions: At 31 March All gures in % per annum 2010 2009 Discount rate 5.5 6.7 Expected rate of return on assets 5.6 5.3 Salary increases 4.5 4.8 Pension increases 3.7 3.3 Ination rate 3.7 3.3 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 97 Notes continued 22.
Pensions continued Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice from published statistics.
The average life expectancy in years on retirement at age 60 of a member currently aged 45 is as follows: At 31 March Years 2010 2009 Male 29.3 28.7 Female 30.8 30.3 The average life expectancy in years on retirement at age 60 of a member currently aged 60 is as follows: At 31 March Years 2010 2009 Male 27.7 27.0 Female 29.3 28.8 The assumptions used above may need to be adjusted in the future to take into account a full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2011.
Any such changes could materially aect the estimated liabilities of the scheme and future contribution rates.
Assets The YPP assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds that are invested in UK and overseas equities, diversied growth funds, property, debt securities and ination swaps.
The trustees of the scheme are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneciaries.
The appointment of trustees to the scheme is determined by the Group in accordance with the schemes trust documentation, as modied by UK statute.
An independent professional trustee and three other trustees are appointed by the Group.
Three further trustees are elected by the active members.
Asset values will increase and decrease as markets rise and fall.
The trustees and management have an agreed strategy to mitigate the risk of having insucient funds if markets fall.
The trustees annually match the low-risk asset portfolio against the cash outows for the following 12 years.
Against longer-term cash payouts they match a combination of investments in ination swaps to mitigate ination risk, and higher risk assets to get higher rates of growth.
The trustees also work with management to ensure sucient assets will be available to settle obligations extending beyond the horizon of 12 years.
The trustees have set their asset allocation approach to split the portfolio into pre-horizon and post-horizon categories.
The pre-horizon assets are all debt securities and at 31 March 2010 comprised around 28% 2009 25% of the total assets.
The post-horizon assets have allocation targets of 40% equities, 20% diversied growth funds, 10% property and 30% ination swaps.
The expected rates of return of each asset type in the YPP are set by reference to yields available on government bonds at the measurement date and appropriate risk margins, and are stated net of expected administration expenses and the expected levy to the UK Pension Protection Fund.
The assets and the annual expected rates of return were: At 31 March 2010 2009 % millions % millions Equities including diversied growth funds 7.3 144.8 6.8 102.0 Bonds 4.3 105.2 4.5 67.5 Property 6.3 26.6 5.8 16.5 Ination swaps 4.6 95.0 4.1 88.3 Other 0.3 3.7 N A Total assets at fair value 375.3 274.3 98 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 Financial statements Notes continued Changes in the fair value of plan assets were as follows: Year ended 31 March millions 2010 2009 Opening fair value of plan assets 274.3 308.9 Expected return 15.2 19.8 Actuarial gain loss 63.6 64.4 Contributions by employer 32.9 19.3 Contributions by participants 0.1 0.1 Benets paid 10.8 9.4 Fair value of plan assets at 31 March 375.3 274.3 The actuarial loss in the year ended 31 March 2010 represents the dierence between the expected return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets as follows: Year ended 31 March millions 2010 2009 Expected return on plan assets 15.2 19.8 Actuarial gain loss 63.6 64.4 Actuarial return loss on plan assets 78.8 44.6 Liabilities The present value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method.
The projected unit method is an accrued benets valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Changes in the present value of the dened benefit liabilities were as follows: Year ended 31 March millions 2010 2009 Opening present value of dened benefit liabilities 296.2 294.9 Current service cost 9.7 15.1 Past service costs 1.2 8.2 Finance cost 19.8 20.1 Actuarial loss gain 122.4 32.8 Contributions by participants 0.1 0.1 Benets paid 10.8 9.4 Present value of dened benefit liabilities at 31 March 438.6 296.2 The actuarial loss in the year ended 31 March 2010 was primarily the result of a decrease in the estimated real interest rate the reference market rate to which the discount rate is tied, net of expected ination implied in the market price of certain government debt during the year.
In the year ended 31 March 2009, the actuarial gain was primarily the result of an increase in real interest rates, which was partially oset by an increase in the estimated longevity of members.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the present value of benets for service already rendered.
This measure diers from the projected unit method in that it allows for deferred pension increases instead of future salary increases and, therefore, measures the obligations as if the employees were no longer able to earn benets from future service.
At 31 March 2010, the accumulated benefit obligation was 417.4 million or 42.1 million more than scheme assets.
Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 99 Notes continued 22.
Pensions continued The prole of expected undiscounted payments by the scheme for benets earned up to 31 March 2010 is as follows: Payments in millions 60m 55m 50m 45m 40m 35m 30m 25m 20m 15m 10m 5m 0 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 2090 The Group estimates that the average duration of these cash ows, representing the weighted average term to payment of the undiscounted benefit payments, is 35 years.
The cost of settling all scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date by buying out benets with a suitable insurer will generally be higher than the present value of scheme liabilities, because an insurer would expect to charge a premium for the risks that would be passed to them.
The Group estimates that the amount required to settle the schemes liabilities with an insurance company at 31 March 2010 would have been around 639 million, which is around 264 million more than the value of plan assets.
History The history of experience gains and losses is as follows: Year ended 31 March All gures in millions unless otherwise stated 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Present value of dened benefit obligation 438.6 296.2 294.9 329.6 309.6 Fair value of plan assets 375.3 274.3 308.9 302.4 271.2 Present value of unfunded dened benefit obligations 1.5 deficit surplus on the plans 63.3 21.9 14.0 27.2 39.9 Dierence between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Gain loss 63.6 64.4 24.4 0.2 26.8 Gain loss as a proportion of scheme assets 17% 23 % 8 % 10% Experience losses gains on scheme liabilities and changes in assumptions: Loss gain 122.4 32.8 68.3 15.9 30.3 Loss gain as a proportion of present value of scheme liabilities 28 % 11% 23% 5% 10 % 100 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2010 Financial statements Notes continued Sensitivity analysis The present value of pension liabilities at 31 March 2010 was calculated on the basis that the real interest rate at the balance sheet date was 1.8%, which is the dierence between the discount rate and expected ination.
The discount rate and expected ination are determined by reference to specic types of debt instruments being traded in the open market.
Increasing or decreasing the assumed real interest rate to 1.9% or 1.7% per annum, respectively, would decrease or increase the present value of pension liabilities by approximately 10 million.
The eect on the market value of assets cannot be estimated because the values of the schemes investments do not always change in line with changes in real interest rates.
The present value of pension liabilities was determined on assumed life expectancies for men and women as set out in the assumptions above.
We estimate that an increase in life expectancy of one year for all members could have increased the present value of pension liabilities by approximately 10 million.
The present value of pension liabilities was determined on the basis of a 0.75% expected average increase in salaries above ination.
Increasing or decreasing the rate of assumed salary increases to 0.85% or 0.65% per annum, respectively, could have increased or decreased the present value of pension liabilities by approximately 3 million.
Dened contribution schemes In addition to the dened contribution Section Four and Section Five of the YPP, Yellowbook sponsors a 401 k plan for the majority of Yellowbook employees in the US.
The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines.
Yellowbook matches a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of Yellowbook in an independently administered fund.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the funds and amounted to 2.2 million in the year ended 31 March 2010 2009 5.1 million for the Yellowbook scheme, and 2.9 million 2009 2.9 million for Section Four and Section Five of the YPP.
Outstanding contributions amounted to 0.7 million at 31 March 2010 2009 1.0 million.

The timing of the distribution of the acquirees directories in August 2009 means that it is not possible to determine the exact contribution they made to the Groups reported results nor what they would have contributed if they had been owned for the entire period.
However, it is estimated that Group revenues were increased by 5.7 million during the period of ownership and if the acquirees had been owned for the whole period that revenues would have been increased by 5.7 million.
Group EBITDA is estimated to have increased by 0.8 million during the period of ownership and would have increased by 0.8 million for the whole year.
Operating profit of the acquirees would not have been materially dierent to EBITDA.
The profit after tax would have increased by no more than 0.6 million during the period of ownership and for the whole year.

h The Capital Accumulation Plan The Yell Group plc Capital Accumulation Plan the CAP was established in February 2004.
It allows the Company to make awards of ordinary shares, which vest three years from the date of grant, to employees.
There are no performance criteria attached to the vesting of these shares, which are awarded to employees whom the Company wishes to retain as key talent within the organisation.
Awards are satisfied by purchasing existing shares on the open market rather than by issue of new shares.
On Change of Control, awards vest in full.
i The Long-term Incentive Plan The Yell Group plc Long-term Incentive Plan the LTIP was established in July 2003 and is not intended to be approved by HM Revenue and Customs.
The Board has sole discretion to determine which executives are granted awards under the LTIP.
Awards are granted in the form of performance shares and in most circumstances an objective performance condition must be satisfied before an award vests.
Normally, awards may only vest three years after their initial date of grant.
For further information, see page 48.
On Change of Control, options become exercisable and performance condition requirements fall away but pro-rating for time applies.
