Business projections prepared for impairment reviews see Note 19 indicate it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which to offset these recognised deferred tax assets within eight years.
UK losses do not expire and Netherlands losses expire after nine years.
In jurisdictions where doubt exists over the availability of future taxable profits, deferred tax assets of 2,008 million 2009 - 2,163 million: 2008 - 1,748 million have not been recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward of 9,689 million 2009 - 7,759 million: 2008 - 5,779 million.
Of these losses, 41 million will expire within one year, 136 million within five years and 5,913 million thereafter.
The balance of tax losses carried forward has no time limit.
2 Deferred tax liabilities of 279 million 2009 - 279 million: 2008 - 980 million have not been recognised in respect of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and held-over gains on the incorporation of overseas branches.
Retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested indefinitely or remitted to the UK free from further tax.
No tax is expected to arise in the foreseeable future in respect of held-over gains.
Changes to UK tax legislation largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
