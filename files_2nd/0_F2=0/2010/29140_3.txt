As total borrowings have a current fair value above par, the effect of valuing the borrowings at fair value reduces both the NAV and resultant discount.
# In the year to 31 March 2009 both revenue earnings and the dividend included a non-recurring 1.5p per share from the reimbursement of previous years VAT and associated interest thereon.
The percentage changes excluding the non-recurring 1.5p are revenue earnings 0.1% and dividend 4.6%.
