7 Income tax and deferred tax continued Tax credits At 30 June 2010, the Group had US$215 million of tax credits that have not been recognised 2009: US$232 million.
Deductible temporary differences At 30 June 2010, the Group had deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets of US$2,195 million 2009: US$2,522 million have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities At 30 June 2010, deferred tax liabilities of US$1,782 million 2009: US$1,421 million associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities have not been recognised because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Other factors affecting taxation The Australian Taxation Office ATO has issued amended assessments during the period from 2005 to 2008 denying bad debt deductions arising from the investments in Hartley, Beenup and Boodarie Iron and the denial of capital allowance claims made on the Boodarie Iron project.
BHP Billiton lodged objections against all the amended assessments.
An amount of US$686 million was paid to the ATO pursuant to ATO disputed assessment guidelines, which require that taxpayers generally must pay half of the tax in dispute to defer recovery proceedings.
The Boodarie Iron and Beenup bad debt disallowance matters and the Boodarie Iron capital allowance matter were heard concurrently in the Federal Court in January 2009.
BHP Billiton was successful on all counts.
The ATO appealed and the matter was heard in the Full Federal Court in November 2009.
BHP Billiton was again successful on all counts.
The ATO sought special leave to appeal to the High Court only in relation to the Beenup bad debt disallowance and the denial of the capital allowance claims on the Boodarie Iron project.
The High Court has granted special leave only in relation to the denial of the capital allowance claims on the Boodarie Iron project.
A date for the appeal has not yet been set.
As a result of the ATO not seeking to challenge the Boodarie Iron project bad debt disallowance, the ATO has refunded US$552 million to BHP Billiton including interest.
BHP Billiton also expects that as a result of the High Court not granting special leave for the Beenup bad debt disallowance, the ATO will refund the amount paid in relation to this dispute of US$62 million plus interest.
BHP Billiton settled the Hartley matter with the ATO in September 2009.
The amount remaining in dispute following the decision of the High Court for the denial of capital allowance claims on the Boodarie Iron project is approximately US$435 million, being primary tax of US$328 million and US$107 million of interest after tax.
