The group expects that future remittances of earnings from its overseas subsidiaries will be covered by the UK dividend exemption and so the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries are not disclosed above.
d impact of rate change The Finance No 2 Act 2010 reduced the main rate of UK Corporation Tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the UK deferred tax asset by a net 0.4m, comprising a credit of 0.5m to the income statement and a charge of 0.9m to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Additional changes to the main rate of UK Corporation Tax are proposed, to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of these proposed reductions would be to reduce the UK net deferred tax asset by 1.1m.
Further UK tax changes, subject to enactment, are a reduction from 1 April 2012 in the rate of capital allowances applicable to plant and machinery and to integral features from 20% to 18% and from 10% to 8% respectively.
Manufacturing relief on profits earned in Ireland is no longer available for the accounting period commencing 4 October 2010.
The effect of the removal of the relief is to increase the net deferred tax asset by a net 0.4m, comprising a charge of 0.3m to the Income Statement and a credit of 0.7m to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
