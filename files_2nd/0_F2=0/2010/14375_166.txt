Financial Instruments and RiskManagement Foreign Exchange Exposures The Group operates in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
The Groups policy is to limit the impact of foreign exchange movements on equity by holding liabilities where practical in the same currencies as the Groups non US Dollar assets.
These liabilities take the form of either borrowings or currency swaps.
The Group designates a portion of foreign currency borrowings in non-operating units as net investment hedges.
As at 31 December 2010, CHF125m 2009 CHF261m of Group borrowingsand nil 2009 $6m of currency swaps were designated as net investment hedges: the movement in the fair value of these hedges attributable to changes in exchange rates is recognised directly in reserves.
The fair value of these hedges at 31 December 2010 was $134m 2009 $252m.
It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets orliabilitiesother than in their functional currencies.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale.
The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportionof sales in Euros exceeds the proportionof costs in Euros.
Financial Instruments and RiskManagement continued The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure.
Cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within cost of goods sold within a further twelve month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $944m 2009 $933m.
Based on the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2010, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would increase by $24m 2009 $52m.
In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, the Groups borrowings would increase by $35m 2009 $63m.
Excluding borrowings designated as net investment hedges, the increase would be $21m 2009 $37m : this increase would be fully offset by corresponding movements in group loan values.
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2010 would have been $20m lower 2009 $19m, which would be recognised through the hedging reserve.
Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2010would have been $19mhigher 2009 $19m.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar against all other currencies at 31 December would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
Since it is the Groups policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, the net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forwardforeign exchange contracts is not significant.
Interest Rate Exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and currency swaps which are all at floating rates.
The Group uses floating to fixed interest swaps to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the balance sheet.
The cash flows resulting from interest rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in market interest rates on the hedged items.
At 31 December 2010 the Group had fixed future interest rates on borrowings totaling $98mfora period of six months and $112mfora period of one year 2009 $515mfora period of one year.
Based on the Groups gross borrowings as at 31 December 2010, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $5m 2009 $6m.
Excluding the impact of the Groups interest rate hedges, the increase in the interest charge would be $7m 2009 $11m.
Similarly if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies, the fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps would increase equity by $2m 2009 $5m.
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
Credit RiskExposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used forfinancial instruments through a system of internal credit limitswhich, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum Arating fromone of the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2010 was $23m 2009 $13m, being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and bank at 31 December 2010 was $207m 2009 $192m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 18 of the Notes to the Group Accounts.

Financial Instruments and RiskManagement continued Currencyand Interest Rate Profileof Interest Bearing Liabilities and Assets In 2010, the Group entered into a series of interest rate swaps to fix the monthly interest payable on $98m for a period of six months and $112m for a period of one year 2009 $515m for a period of one year of the Groups floating rate borrowings.
The swaps are denominated in USDollars, Euros and SwissFrancs.

In 2009, the Group also had liabilities due for deferred acquisition consideration denominated in US Dollars, Euro and Yen totalling $46m on which no interest was payable see Note 21 of the Notes to the Group Accounts.
There are no other significant interest bearing financial liabilities.
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one or three-month LIBOR interest rate relevant to the currency concerned.
The weighted average interest rate on floating rate borrowingsas at 31 December 2010was 1% 2009 1%.
