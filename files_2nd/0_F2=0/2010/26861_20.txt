34 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st January 2010 1.
Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value.
The Company had a dormant, wholly owned subsidiary Mercantile Management Limited, which was dissolved on 27th October 2009.
The results of the subsidiary for the period prior to its dissolution have not been consolidated as exemption under Section 405 of the Companies Act 2006 has been exercised due to the immateriality of the subsidiary.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and deposit balances and other capital receipts and payments are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end, including the related gains and losses arising from changes in foreign exchange rates, are dealt with in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premiums or discounts on purchase, are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Underwriting commission is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: management fees are allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise brokerage commission and stamp duty.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 40.
The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 35 e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
Breakage costs incurred on the early repayment of loans are charged 100% to capital.
f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debentures in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
g Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to the capital column of the income statement on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
h VAT Expenses are disclosed inclusive of the related irrecoverable VAT.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.
VAT recovered on management fees has been credited to income and capital in the same proportion as those management fees were originally charged to income and capital.
i Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is the also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and deposit balances are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Gains and losses on investments held at the year end arising from changes in foreign exchange rates are included in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
j Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.

This has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The disclosures required by the amendment to FRS 29: Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments are given below.
The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 29 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio.
The Company currently holds no derivative financial instruments and its liabilities are not held at fair value.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 on page 34.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 29 hierarchy: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss at 31st January 2010 Equity investments 1,137,933 17,961 1,155,894 Fixed interest investments 2,342 2,342 Total 1,137,933 20,303 1,158,236 There have been no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during the year.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust the Company invests in equities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these financial risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The Company has no significant direct exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in equity shares and other securities, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and debentures issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises two elements interest rate risk and market price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these two elements of market risk is given in parts i and ii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when interest rates are re-set.
Interest rate exposure The two series of debentures issued by the Company both carry fixed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
This debenture stock is carried in the Companys balance sheet at amortised cost rather than fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the share price and discount which is not likely to be material.
The Company has no significant holdings of fixed interest rate securities whose fair value would be affected by interest rate movements.
The Company does not normally hold a significantly high level of cash balances and there is an overdraft facility available when required.
Therefore the Company would not normally have any significant exposure to interest rate risk.
However the Company was holding high levels of cash and short term deposits at the comparative year end due to unusual market conditions.
The Companys exposure to cash flow interest rate risk due to cash and deposit balances at the year end was as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank and short term deposits 40,225 171,392 Interest receivable on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2009: same.
46 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Notes to the Accounts continued 23.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued i Interest rate risk continued The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of cash balances has fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum cash balances during the year are as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Maximum cash at bank and short term deposits 149,565 292,272 Minimum cash at bank and short term deposits 33,036 143,647 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2009: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applied to the Companys cash balances.

ii Market price risk Market price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of market price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Market price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 31st January comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,155,894 716,891 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to market price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 14 to 15 This shows that the majority of the investments value is in the UK.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital and to gear the Company as appropriate.

The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
