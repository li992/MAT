The acquired businesses contributed a net loss after tax of 535,000 to the Group for the period from 23 July 2009 to 30 April 2010.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 May 2009, Group profit after tax would have been 79,438,000.

23 Capital management, financial instruments and financial risk management The Group finances its operations by a combination of shareholders funds, minority interest, deposits and on account contract receipts and, where taken out, borrowings.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to maintain an appropriate capital structure in the business to allow management to focus on creating sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, with flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise in the short and medium-term.
The Group monitors capital levels principally by monitoring net debt cash levels, cash generated and return on average capital employed.
The Groups financial instruments comprise financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities being: loan stock, bank loans, trade payables, deposits and on account receipts, loans from joint ventures and accruals.
Cash and cash equivalents is the principal financial instrument used to finance the business.
The other financial instruments highlighted arise in the ordinary course of business.
As all of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling there is no direct currency risk, and, therefore the Groups main financial risks are primarily: liquidity risk the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available: market interest rate risk the risk that Group financing activities are adversely affected by fluctuation in market interest rates: and market credit risk the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Group.
ANNUAL REPORT 2010 | BERKELEY 82 | NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 Capital management, financial instruments and financial risk management continued Financial instruments: Financial assets The Groups financial assets can be summarised as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Current Trade receivables 42,842 46,198 Cash and cash equivalents 349,119 284,842 391,961 331,040 Cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits held at either floating rates linked to LIBOR or fixed rates.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing.
Financial instruments: Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities can be summarised as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Current Loan stock 48 66 Bank loans 7,000 Trade payables 204,864 196,060 Deposits and on account contract receipts 461,568 334,827 Loans from joint ventures 96 96 Accruals and deferred income 28,471 39,429 702,047 570,478 Non-current Trade payables 51,848 57,558 Bank loans 25,203 77,051 57,558 Total financial liabilities 779,098 628,036 All amounts included above are unsecured, except for the site specific bank loans which are secured by a fixed charge over the specific assets to which they relate.
Loan stock is repayable on three months notice being given to the Company, with floating interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Current bank loans have term expiry dates within twelve months of the balance sheet date and are held at floating interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Trade payables and other current liabilities are non-interest bearing.
Non-current bank loans have term expiry dates after twelve months from the balance sheet date and are held at floating interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The maturity profile of the Groups non-current financial liabilities, all of which are held at amortised cost, is as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 In more than one year but not more than two years 48,045 10,044 In more than two years but not more than five years 29,006 43,526 In more than five years 3,988 77,051 57,558 The carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities approximate to fair value.
Current trade receivables and current trade and other payables approximate to their fair value as the transactions which give rise to these balances arise in the normal course of trade and, where relevant, with industry standard payment terms and have a short period to maturity less than one year.
The loan stock is repayable at book value on three months notice being given to the Company.
Non-current trade payables comprise long-term land creditors which are held at their discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
The discount rate applied reflects the nominal, risk-free pre-tax rate at the balance sheet date, applied to the maturity profile of the individual land creditors within the total.
Non-current bank loans approximate to fair value as they are held at variable market interest rates linked to LIBOR.
BERKELEY | ANNUAL REPORT 2010 FINANACIALS FINANCIALS | NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | 83 Liquidity risk This is the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available.
Group management addresses this risk through review of rolling cash flow forecasts throughout the year to assess and monitor the current and forecast availability of funding, and to ensure sufficient headroom against facility limits and compliance with banking covenants.
The committed borrowing facilities are set out below.
The contractual undiscounted maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, included at their balance sheet carrying value in the tables above, is as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 In less than one year 702,047 570,478 In more than one year but not more than two years 49,519 10,318 In more than two years but not more than five years 29,199 45,351 In more than five years 4,312 780,765 630,459 Market interest rate risk The Groups cash and cash equivalents and bank loans expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups rolling cash flow forecasts incorporate appropriate interest assumptions, and management carefully assesses expected activity levels and associated funding requirements in the prevailing and forecast interest rate environment to ensure that this risk is managed.
From time to time the Group uses derivative instruments, when commercially appropriate, to manage interest rate risk by altering the interest rates on investments and funding so that the resulting exposure gives greater certainty of future costs.
During the year and at the year end the Group held no such instruments 2009: nil.
If interest rates on the Groups cash balances had been 50 basis points higher lower throughout the year ended 30 April 2010, profit after tax for the year would have been 305,000 higher lower 2009: 508,000.
This calculation is based on the monthly closing net cash debt position throughout the financial year.
The Groups loan stock amounts to 48,000 2009: 66,000 and so no sensitivity analysis has been prepared against this interest-bearing financial liability as any impact would not be material.
Market credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk encompasses the financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Trade receivables are spread across a wide number of customers, with no significant concentration of credit risk in one area.
There has been no impairment of trade receivables during the year 2009: nil, nor are there any provisions held against trade receivables 2009: nil, and no trade receivables are past their due date 2009: nil.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are three leading international banks with long-term AA credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Committed borrowing facilities The Group has committed borrowing facilities as follows: 2010 2009 Available Drawn Undrawn Termination Available Drawn Undrawn Termination 000 000 000 Date 000 000 000 Date Revolving credit facility 300,000 300,000 Nov-13 800,000 800,000 Aug 11 Site specific facility 4,000 4,000 Sep-10 Site specific facility 3,000 3,000 Jan-11 Site specific facility 32,000 11,795 20,205 Sep-12 Site specific facility 14,000 14,000 Jan-13 353,000 32,795 320,205 800,000 800,000 The drawn facilities of 32,795,000 do not include unamortised issue costs which are netted off the drawn funds for the purpose of disclosing borrowings as set out in note 14.
During the year the Group restructured its banking facilities.
With effect from 20 November 2009, the revolving credit facility was extended to November 2013 from August 2011 and was reduced from 800 million to 300 million, a level that is commensurate with the capital structure and requirements of the Group.
The revolving credit facility is secured by debentures provided by certain Group holding companies over their assets.
The facility agreement contains financial covenants, which is normal for such agreements, all of which the Group is in compliance with.
The facility was undrawn at 30 April 2010, except for bank bonds in issue of 10,862,000 2009: nil.
