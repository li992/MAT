d Impairment testing All interests in joint ventures have been tested for impairment but the only material items are detailed below.
i CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad The Groups investments in CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both the investments have been determined based on value in use calculations.
This calculation is an actuarially determined appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The recoverable amounts exceed the carrying values of both the investments.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Cash flow projections based on: i the policy portfolio expected at the valuation date: and ii the future sales based on plans approved by management covering the subsequent three-year period.
The cash flows from the existing policy portfolio are calculated using best estimate assumptions, which have been supported by experience investigations where available and prudent estimates typical for the market where experience investigations are not available: The embedded value for existing business was derived using risk free rates: The value in use was derived as the sum of embedded value of existing business and the new business contribution in each future year discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate of 13.8%: and New sales beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 10%.
CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad are developing businesses and the recoverability of value is reliant on future projected growth being achieved.
These projections are inherently uncertain and dependent on local economic conditions.
222 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 18 Interests in, and loans to, joint ventures continued ii AvivaSA Emeklilik five Hayat A. S. The Groups investment in AvivaSA Emeklilik five Hayat A. S. has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value which includes goodwill which arose on its acquisition with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating unit including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business.
New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three-year business plans approved by management.
Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 3%.
Risk adjusted discount rate of 16.5% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate reflects a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
