c Tax is calculated by applying discrete quarterly effective tax rates excluding the impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on group profit or loss, to the non-operating items as they arise each quarter.
However, the US statutory tax rate has been used for expenditures relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that qualify for tax relief.
In 2009, no tax credit was calculated on the goodwill impairment in Refining and Marketing because the charge is not tax deductible.
