Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2009: same.
Interest rate sensitivity The Group is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its cash balances, its current asset investment and its fixed income investment portfolio.
The sensitivity of each exposure is as follows: Cash Cash balances vary throughout the year.
Cash balances at the year end were 8,910,000 2009: 5,989,000 and if that level of cash was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 89,000 2009: 60,000.
Current asset investment sensitivity The Company's interest bearing current asset investment at the year end was 6,300,000 2009: 13,500,000 and if that level of investment was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis points change in interest rates up or down, would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 63,000 2009: 135,000.
Fixed income investment sensitivity The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 3,582,000 2009: 19,079,000, and it had a modified duration interest rate sensitivity of approximately 5.4 years 2009: 5.2 years.
A 100 basis points change in short term interest rates up or down, which is mirrored by an equivalent change in long term interest rates, would be expected to decrease or increase this portfolios value by approximately 192,000 2009: 915,000, all other factors being equal.
