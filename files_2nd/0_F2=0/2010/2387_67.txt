Alternative Energy Alternative Energy comprises BPs low-carbon businesses and future growth options outside oil and gas, which we believe have the potential to be a material source of low-carbon energy and are aligned with BPs core capabilities.
These are biofuels, wind and solar, along with demonstration projects and technology development in carbon capture and storage CCS.
Our market It is well accepted that a more diverse mix of energy will be required to meet future demand.
BPs own estimates suggest that global primary energy demand will increase by around 40% between 2010 and 2030.
Supported by government policies, wind power has grown rapidly in many a countries and is now growing globally at an annual rate of 30%, while installed solar photovoltaic capacity is predicted to increase from 15GW in b 2008 to 410GW in 2035 and between 2010 and 2030, biofuels are c expected to contribute 30% of the global growth in supply of liquid fuels.
Our performance Alternative Energy continues to make progress against its commitment to invest $8 billion by 2015.
Our investment since 2005 is more than d $5 billion.
Our wind business has added 125MW of gross capacity during 2010, with the commercial start-up of the Goshen North wind farm.
In our solar business, we achieved sales of 325MW and signed several strategic supply deals see Solar on page 62.
Our biofuels business acquired the lignocellulosic assets from Verenium Corporation Inc. for $98 million.
