Basis of accounting In accordance with eu law Ias regulation ec 1606 2002, the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial reporting standards IFrs adopted for use in the eu as at 26 March 2010 adopted IFrs, International Financial reporting Interpretations committee IFrIc interpretations and those parts of the companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFrs.
the company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with uK Generally accepted accounting principles uK Gaap : these are presented on pages 55 to 58. the group financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
the parent company financial statements present information about the company as a separate entity and not about its group.
Accounting standards adopted in the period Ias 1 presentation of Financial statements revised september 2007 was adopted during the period.
this results in a number of terminology changes and changes in presentation and disclosure, including presenting a consolidated statement of comprehensive income to replace the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, and the inclusion of a consolidated statement of changes in equity.
there is no impact to the financial statements other than presentation.
IFrs 8 operating segments was adopted during the period.
adoption of this standard has not led to any changes in reporting and the financial statements are presented as a single reportable segment.
More details are presented in the accounting policies.
there have been no further alterations made to the accounting policies as a result of considering all amendments to IFrs and IFrIc interpretations that became effective during the financial period as these were considered to be immaterial to the Groups operations or were not relevant.
New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International accounting standards Board that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period.
the following have not been adopted by the Group: Effective for accounting periods International Financial Reporting Standards starting on or after Ias 39 embedded derivatives amendment 30 June 2009 IFrs 1 First time adoption of IFrs revised 1 July 2009 Ias 27 consolidated and separate financial statements amended 1 July 2009 Ias 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement: eligible hedged items 1 July 2009 IFrs 3 Business combinations revised 1 July 2009 IFrs 2 Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions amendment 1 January 2010 IFrs 1 additional exemptions for first time adopters amendment 1 January 2010 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFrIc 9 embedded derivatives amendment 30 June 2009 IFrIc 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to owners 1 July 2009 IFrIc 18 transfers of assets from customers 1 July 2009 these standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the european union.
the application of these standards and interpretations is not anticipated to have a material effect on the Groups financial statements.

General information continued Basis of preparation the financial statements are presented in sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
they are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments and retirement benefit assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value.
the financial statements for the current and prior period have been prepared for a 52 week period to reflect internal management reporting.
Basis of consolidation subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Going concern the Directors consider that the risks noted in the Directors report are those known to the Directors at the date of such report which the Directors consider to be material to the Group but these do not necessarily comprise all risks to which the Group is exposed.
In particular, the Groups performance could be adversely affected by poor economic conditions.
additional risks and uncertainties currently unknown to the Directors, or which the Directors currently believe are immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Group.
the Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance and considering the risks identified, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility.
after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the group and company financial statements.
Use of assumptions and estimates the preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
actual results may differ from these estimates.
these estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
some of these policies require a high level of judgement and the Directors and the audit committee believes that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for: Ias19 employee benefits.
Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations.
Ias37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
the Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading.
Whilst every effort is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible.
Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable from the tenant if any for the period up until the point it is judged that the lease will no longer be onerous.
In addition, provisions exist for the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties and the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties.
the Directors believe that their estimates, which are based upon the advice of an in house property department who monitor the uK property market, are appropriate.
In testing for impairment of goodwill, the Directors have made certain assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast into perpetuity.
should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible that goodwill included in the balance sheet could be impaired.
at 26 March 2010, the Directors do not consider that any reasonably likely changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the goodwill to become impaired.
In applying the Groups accounting policy in relation to deferred tax, as set out below, the Directors are required to make assumptions regarding the Groups ability to utilise historical tax assets following an assessment of the likely quantum and timing of future taxable profits.
a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that the Directors are confident that the Groups future profits will utilise historical tax assets.
32 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2010 2.
Accounting policies the accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
Business combinations and goodwill subject to the transitional relief in IFrs 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 april 2006, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities acquired.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is capitalised and is subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable.
on 4 June 2007 the company, then named Blueheath Holdings plc, became the legal parent company of Giant topco limited in a share-for-share transaction.
Due to the relative values of the companies, the former Giant topco limited shareholders became the majority shareholders with 90.36% of the enlarged share capital.
as part of the business combination Blueheath Holdings plc changed its name to Booker Group plc and changed its accounting reference date to 31 March.
Following the transaction the companys continuing operations and executive management were predominantly those of Giant topco limited.
IFrs 3 Business combinations defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control.
accordingly, the combination was accounted as a reverse acquisition i. e. as if Giant topco limited had acquired Blueheath Holdings plc in return for consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued.
Cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits repayable on demand.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Cost of sales cost of sales represents all costs incurred up to the point of sale including the operating expenses of the trading outlets.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans the Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
the liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on aa credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
the calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
all actuarial gains and losses as at 1 april 2006, the date of transition to adopted IFrss, were recognised.
In respect of actuarial gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 april 2006 the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in other comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
the expected return on pension scheme assets recorded net of the costs to administer the scheme and the interest on pension scheme liabilities are shown in net finance costs within the income statement.
Short-term benefits short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
a provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
33 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2010 notes to tHe Group FInancIal stateMents continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Cash flow hedges the Group uses a cash flow hedge to manage its exposure to interest rate risks arising from financing activities and they are stated at fair value.
the fair value is the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay to terminate these instruments at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the instruments counterparties.
changes in the fair value, that are designated and effective as hedges of the future volatility of interest expense, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a. they include no contractual obligations upon the group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and b. where the instrument will or may be settled in the companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
to the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Foreign currency transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Guarantees third party property guarantees are recognised as a financial liability under Ias 37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
these are measured and recognised at fair value.
these property guarantees are included within provisions on the balance sheet.
Impairment the carrying values of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
an impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognised in the income statement.
34 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2010 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
cost is based on the weighted average principle and includes certain warehousing and distribution costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their existing location less supplier volume rebates.
net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of disposal.
Interest bearing borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
costs associated with extending the bank facility are recognised in the income statement over the life of the facility.
unamortised fees outstanding in relation to the replaced lender have been written off, whilst those relating to the remaining lender have been rolled forward and will be amortised over the extended facility.
all other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Leases Operating lease payments payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Where a lease has a minimum fixed increase, the total minimum lease payments are spread over the lease term.
the total amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the income statement charge changes.
the excess of the rent charged over the cash payment in any period will be held on the balance sheet within accruals and deferred income.
lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
the finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Net financing costs Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
the prior period interest income includes a discount on the buyback of debt.
Operating segments IFrs 8 operating segments requires that the segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information that is provided to the chief operating decision maker.
the chief operating decision maker has been identified as the ceo.
Internal reports reviewed regularly by the ceo focus on the operations of the Group as a whole and do not identify individual operating segments.
Whilst turnover is reported by customer and product type, it is not possible to analyse profitability and balance sheets in this way.
products flow through the same distribution channels and there are a large amount of expenses and assets liabilities that are not specific.
none of these possible segments have a unique management structure responsible for getting the product from the supplier to the customer.
the Directors therefore present the financial statements as a single reportable segment.
Property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
labour and associated costs that have been incurred specifically on the extra branch conversions have been capitalised in leasehold improvements and are being depreciated over the lesser of 10 years or the number of years remaining on the lease.
leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
the estimated useful lives are as follows: leasehold improvements lesser of the unexpired term of the lease and 50 years plant and equipment 3-10 years Motor vehicles 4 years 35 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2010 notes to tHe Group FInancIal stateMents continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Provisions a provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Revenue revenue is recognised when goods are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them.
revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods net of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax.
Discounts are accounted for in the period they are earned.
provision is made for expected customer returns.
Share based payments the Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
the fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in a separate share option reserve.
this valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, taking into account service conditions and market performance.
the dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Supplier rebates supplier allowances and credits are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as they are earned according to the underlying agreement.
allowances consist primarily of promotional allowances, quantity discounts and payments under merchandising agreements.
amounts received under promotional or other merchandising allowance agreements that require specific performance are recognised when the performance is satisfied, the amount is fixed and determinable and the collection is reasonably assured.
Taxation tax expense included in the Income statement comprises current and deferred tax.
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets excluding goodwill and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the amount which is recognised is increased or reduced to the extent that it is then probable or no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Intangible assets Goodwill m Cost and net book value at 27 March 2009 and 26 March 2010 423.9 the Group is required to test its goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.
Impairment reviews compare the carrying value of the goodwill contained in each cash generating unit cGu with its recoverable amount.
Goodwill arose in the Group following the acquisitions of the Big Food Group limited by Giant topco limited in 2005 and the reverse acquisition of Blueheath Holdings plc in 2007. the Directors believe that only one cash generating unit cGu now exists within the Group as all aspects of its operations are interdependent on each other.
the operations of Blueheath are now fully integrated with those of the cash and carry business.
the recoverable amount of the cGu is considered to be its value in use, calculated by reference to the Groups pre tax cash flow projections based on the Groups approved budget for 2011 and plan for 2012. cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated into perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2% 2009: 2%, being the Directors estimated view of the long term compound growth in the economy.
this is considered appropriate because the cGu is considered to be a long term business.
the main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the level of sales, gross margin and expenses within the business and have been set by the Directors based on their past experience of the business and its industry together with their future plans for the business and expectations of the market.
the level of sales depends upon the size of the markets in which the Group operates together with the Directors estimations of its market share and competitive pressures.
Gross margin is dependent upon the net costs to the business of purchasing products together with the level of supplier rebates and income to support sales activities.
expenses are based on the current cost base of the Group adjusted for variable costs and known plans for the business.
a pre tax discount rate of 11.2% 2009: 13.5% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
the discount rate reflects the market assumptions for the risk free rate and equity risk premium and also takes into account the cost of debt.
a sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
With all other assumptions held constant, a 5% increase in the pre tax discount rate to 16.2% or a decline in growth of -5.0% does not identify that an impairment is required.
the Directors believe that the assumptions on which the carrying value of goodwill is supported are reasonable and that no impairment to goodwill is required.

Financial instruments Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2. the book value and fair value of the financial instruments are as follows: Book value Fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 Note m m m m Financial assets loans and other receivables 33.4 28.9 33.4 28.9 cash and cash equivalents 43.7 20.4 43.7 20.4 77.1 49.3 77.1 49.3 Financial liabilities other financial liabilities a 1.6 11.6 1.6 11.6 Borrowings b 40.0 50.2 37.7 47.5 trade and other payables 382.9 337.9 382.9 337.9 property guarantees c 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 428.5 403.7 426.2 401.0 loans and other receivables represent amounts receivable from the sale of goods, together with amounts due from rebates see note 13 and are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently held at amortised cost.
Fair values have been calculated as follows: a. estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates b. based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows c. estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity and risk of each guarantee crystallising the following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities: Due within Due between Due between Due between Over 4 years 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 3 years 3 and 4 years m m m m m 2010 Financial instruments 1.6 Borrowings 40.0 trade and other payables 382.9 384.5 40.0 2009 Financial instruments 4.7 3.8 1.6 1.4 Borrowings 0.2 50.0 trade and other payables 337.9 342.8 3.8 1.6 51.4 It is not possible to quantify the timing of the cash flows relating to the property guarantees.
the undiscounted cash flows for borrowings differ from their carrying value in the balance sheet due to the inclusion of contractual interest payments and the adjustment for non cash items including unamortised borrowing costs.
the undiscounted cash flows for financial instruments reflect the amounts payable on these instruments which differs from the fair value recorded on the balance sheet.
there is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due to their short term nature.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk the Group is predominantly a cash sales business with low levels of trade receivables in comparison to total sales for the year and has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
the Group has an accounting policy to provide for certain overdue trade receivables based on past experience, and believe that there are no significant unprovided overdue financial assets.
Liquidity risk the Group will finance operations and growth from existing cash resources, finance leases and committed borrowing facilities to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet both current and future forecast requirements.
Interest rate risk the Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it has bank borrowings with a floating interest rate.
this risk is managed by the use of interest rate contracts so that the exposure is either on a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within predefined limits.
at the start of the year the Group was party to an instrument with a notional value of 130m designated as 13 tranches of 10m.
the various components of the instrument were: an interest swap at 4.98% maturing in 2011 cap and floor options maturing in 2011 which effectively set a collar between 4.25% and 5.68% but if lIBor falls below 4.25% the floor rises to 5.21% an option at 4.98% exercisable by the lender in March 2011 for 2 years on 12 June 2009, the terms of the interest rate swap were amended, to reflect the Groups current and expected level of debt.
the option caps, the floor and the extension option were removed and the amount of interest rate swap was reduced from 130m to 50m.
the interest rate swap remains at 4.98%.
10m of the interest rate swap expired in March 2010 with the remaining 40m expiring in March 2011. the Group spent 7.2m in settlement of this liability, which is shown separately in the consolidated cash flow statement.
2010 2009 m m Interest rate swap designated and effective as cash flow hedging instrument 1.6 3.9 Interest rate swap carried at fair value through the income statement 7.7 current liabilities 1.6 11.6 the movement in the fair value is as follows: at start of period 11.6 2.0 effective portion of changes in the fair value of interest rate hedge 1.4 4.5 Ineffective hedge transferred to the income statement 1.4 net loss on re-measurement of interest rate swap to fair value through the income statement 5.1 cash settlement 7.2 at end of period 1.6 11.6 a table showing the period cash flows associated with the interest rate contracts is shown on the previous page.
the impact on the income statement is considered to be equivalent to the impact on cash flows.
sensitivity analysis has been based on the exposure to interest rates on the borrowings that were outstanding at the balance sheet date and taking into account the financial instruments.
as the only borrowings outstanding are 40m of bank loans and these are hedged at 4.98%, changes to lIBor will not affect the interest charge on the bank loans.
46 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2010 Capital risk the Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
the Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
the Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account i. e. share capital and retained earnings.
the Group has 7.0m of net cash as at 26 March 2010 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
the Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Foreign currency risk less than 1% of purchases are denominated in foreign currencies and all sales are denominated in sterling.
the Directors do not consider that the Group has significant exposure to movements in foreign exchange and the Group does not hold any foreign exchange contracts.
