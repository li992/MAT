Financial statements IFRS 207 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 8 Long-term business economic volatility continued The expected return on equities and properties has been calculated by reference to the 10-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin.
These are the same assumptions as are used under MCEV principles to calculate the longer-term investment return for the Groups long-term business.
For fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held.
Where such securities are classified as available for sale, such as in the United States, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.
9 Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split between a calculated longerterm return and short-term fluctuations from this.
This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: Non-long-term business 2010 2009 m m 243 Short-term fluctuation in investment return see b below 95 Economic assumption changes see g below 57 61 304 152 b The longer-term investment return and short-term fluctuation are as follows: Non-long-term business 2010 2009 m m Net investment income 719 1,373 Internal charges included under other headings 55 193 774 1,180 Analysed between: Longer-term investment return, reported within operating profit 1,017 1,085 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit General insurance and health 158 218 Other operations 85 123 243 95 774 1,180 c The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer-term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
Actual income and longer-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities.
For other operations, the longer-term return reflects interest income earned in the Netherlands bank and retail mortgage divisions.
