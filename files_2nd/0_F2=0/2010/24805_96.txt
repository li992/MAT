Tax on ordinary activities 2010 2009 000 000 Analysis of charge in year Overseas taxation 154 84 Factors affecting tax charge for year The tax charge for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28% 2009 28%.
The differences are explained below: Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 138,496 140,437 Net return on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28% 2009 28% 38,779 39,322 Capital returns not taxable 38,724 39,208 Dividends not subject to UK tax 1,637 1,088 Overseas withholding tax claimed as a deduction 24 Overseas withholding tax 154 84 Movement in excess management expenses 1,582 995 Overseas income taxable on receipt 3 Current tax charge for the year 154 84 As an Investment Trust, the Companys capital gains are not taxable.
There is no UK corporation tax charge at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009 as the Company has unrelieved management expenses which are available to be carried forward.
The tax charge for 31 December 2010 and 2009 comprises overseas withholding taxes written off.
At 31 December 2010 the Company had surplus management expenses of 28 million 2009 22 million which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.
