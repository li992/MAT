Business combinations On 29 January 2010 the Group completed its acquisition of MAMA Group Plc, when its offer for the entire issued share capital became unconditional.
MAMA comprised a diverse range of music-related businesses, and was the Groups joint venture partner in the Mean Fiddler Group, the UKs second largest multiple live music venue operator.
The consideration paid to acquire MAMAs shares was 46.0m, which included 4.2m incurred in December 2009, when 10% of share capital was acquired at 5.25p per share, with the remaining share capital subsequently purchased at 5.4p per share.
The total consideration also includes 15.5m including 1.7m fees incurred in the Groups earlier investment in Mean Fiddler Group see Note 17.
This gives a total cost of acquisition of 62.5m, all of which was satisfied in cash.
There has been no change in the fair value of Mean Fiddler Group since the original acquisition except for the share of profits of 1.1m recognised in the period during which it was equity accounted.
As a result of the acquisition, goodwill of 44.1m has been capitalised see Note 16.
The Group has paid an amount in excess of the fair value of the net assets based on the expected future profitability and cash generation of the business, as well as a number of synergy benefits including using the HMV brand and business relationships to improve operating metrics, and the opportunity with MAMA to build a wider ticketing business of scale.
As part of the fair value exercise, historic goodwill of 22.0m in the books of MAMA Group was written-off.
In addition, intangible assets totalling 5.2m 3.6m over the book value have been recognised on acquisition, reflecting the fair value of various brands predominantly relating to MAMAs festivals business.
From the date of acquisition to 24 April 2010, the operations of MAMA Group contributed 8.1m of revenue and made a loss before tax and exceptional items of 0.2m.
In addition, exceptional costs of 1.6m were charged in the period relating to integration costs see Note 7.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period, revenue for the Group would have been 2,053.9m, operating profit before exceptional items would have been 83.3m and profit before tax and exceptional items would have been 76.5m.

They are considered to have an indefinite life as they can be renewed at minimal costs and therefore no amortisation has been charged.
Non-amortisation is supported by an annual impairment review.
Intangible assets continued Also included are various trademarks and domain names pertaining to the Fopp brand.
These are considered to have a useful life of 10 years and amortisation is being charged over this period.
Various brands predominantly relating to MAMAs festivals business, totalling 5.2m, have been capitalised on the acquisition of MAMA Group Plc on 29 January 2010.
They are considered to have a useful life of 20 years and amortisation is being charged over this period.
Goodwill of 44.1m has been recognised relating to the same acquisition, which is allocated to the Live cash-generating unit.
The fair values used in the calculation of the goodwill, and hence the carrying value of the goodwill, are provisional, as detailed in Note 15.
The carrying value of the goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review, however there are no indicators of impairment in the short trading period since acquisition.
Goodwill of 71.0m arising on the purchase of Ottakars plc on 3 July 2006 has been capitalised.
The goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review so as to ensure that the carrying amount is not greater than the recoverable amount, which is determined from a value in use calculation incorporating cash flow projections based on forecasts approved by senior management over a five year period.
The recoverable amount was determined in previous years on the basis of a value in use calculation with regard to the portfolio of Ottakars stores acquired.
Following extensive restructuring of the Waterstones business, into which the former Ottakars stores have been subsumed, the recoverable amount is now based on the value in use of the Waterstones business as a whole as this is the level at which the goodwill is now monitored internally.
The forecasts used include managements most recent and cautious view of medium-term trading prospects.
Cash flows beyond the five years have been extrapolated using a 1% growth rate 2009: 1%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant market.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10% 2009: 10% based on an adjusted WACC for the Group.
On the basis of the impairment review undertaken, no impairment of the capitalised goodwill was required.
The calculation of value in use is sensitive to assumptions made with respect to sales forecasts, gross margin and discount rates.
To illustrate, the recoverable amount would reduce to a value equal to the carrying amount if budgeted sales reduce 2.5%, budgeted gross margin rate reduces by 0.5% or the discount rate increases by 1.4%.
The Company had no intangible assets.

Derivatives and financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising on expected future purchases of internationally sourced products in the Groups subsidiaries.
In all cases the implementation of these derivative instruments has been negotiated to match expected purchases and qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of cash flow hedges in place at 24 April 2010 is 0.1m asset 2009: 0.1m asset, which has been recognised in the hedging reserve.
Interest rate hedging Based on its current debt levels, the Group moves to a net cash position during its third quarter and therefore interest rate exposure is limited.
Consequently, no interest rate hedging instruments have been utilised during the period, except that detailed below.
Interest rate exposures continue to be monitored in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
On acquisition of MAMA Group Plc, the Group acquired a callable interest rate swap, which had been entered into by MAMA as a hedge against interest payments.
The carrying value and the fair value of this financial instrument was a 0.8m liability at acquisition and at 24 April 2010.
The hedge is deemed to be ineffective and therefore future changes to the carrying value will be charged or credited to the income statement.
Fair values Derivative financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet are considered to be level two of the fair value hierarchy.
Valuation of these instruments involves the use of a model with inputs that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
The fair values of each category of the Groups financial instruments and their carrying values in the Groups balance sheet, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, are as follows: 24 April 2010 25 April 2009 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Financial assets Cash and short-term deposits 29.7 29.7 52.7 52.7 Foreign exchange forward contracts 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Financial liabilities Long-term borrowings 7.7 7.7 Short-term borrowings 81.1 81.1 45.1 46.0 Interest rate swap 0.8 0.8 Bank overdrafts 2.4 2.4 7.2 7.2 Finance leases 5.1 5.1 6.0 6.0 The fair values of each category of the Companys financial instruments and their carrying values in the Companys balance sheet, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, are as follows: 24 April 2010 25 April 2009 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Financial assets Cash and short-term deposits 48.9 48.9 15.8 15.8 Foreign exchange forward contracts 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Financial liabilities Short-term borrowings 80.3 80.3 45.1 46.0 Foreign exchange forward contracts 0.1 0.1 Bank overdrafts 6.9 6.9 30.0 30.0 86 Notes to the financial statements continued 24.
Derivatives and financial instruments continued The fair value of cash and short-term deposits and overdrafts is based on the carrying amount as a result of their short maturity.
The fair value of borrowings is based on the carrying amount, adjusted for unamortised deferred financing fees, as a result of their short maturity.
The fair value of finance lease obligations represents the present value of minimum lease payments Note 34.
For both the Group and the Company the carrying value of trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables and other payables equates to the fair value.
The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined using foreign exchange spot rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts to which the Group and Company were committed at the balance sheet date is as follows: Group Group Company Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Commercial activities: Euro 4.3 4.6 4.3 4.6 US Dollar 1.8 1.3 1.8 1.3 6.1 5.9 6.1 5.9 25.
Financial risk factors The Companys and Groups business exposes it to certain limited financial risks, such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Groups Treasury department is principally responsible for managing these risks using policies approved by the Board.
Liquidity risk The Companys and Groups strategy for managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Company and Group have sufficient funds and facilities available to satisfy their current requirements.
Liquidity forecasts are prepared on a regular basis to ensure the optimal use of facilities and although covenant compliance is tested every six months, forecast compliance is reviewed on a monthly basis.
Longer term projections are also made to assess strategic funding requirements.
The Company has a 240m multi-currency revolving credit facility, with a final maturity date of 9 October 2011.
The facility amortised by 20m on 20 November 2009 but was subsequently extended by 40m on 1 March 2010 following the acquisition of MAMA Group Plc.
The facility extension amortises on 1 January 2011.
The Group also has a five year term loan in Mean Fiddler Group Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary acquired with MAMA Group Plc, repayable by 0.2m quarterly, with an outstanding balance at 24 April 2010 of 8.8m and a final maturity of 13 November 2014.
The Group also has some locally arranged bank facilities, which do not have a fixed maturity date but are reviewed annually.

Fees totalling 0.3m incurred in arranging the Mean Fiddler Group term loan were deferred and are being amortised over the five year term of the facility to November 2014.
Interest is payable on the revolving credit facility at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% and on the term loan at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 4.25%.
Financial risk factors continued Of the 240.0m 2009: 220.0m revolving credit facility, 81.0m 2009: 46.0m had been drawndown at 24 April 2010.

Financial risk factors continued Security The borrowings under the Facility Agreement are secured by the Guarantors that comprise HMV Group plc and any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company who accede to the Facility Agreement as guarantors.
As a condition of the Agreement, the aggregate gross assets, revenue and earnings before interest and tax of the Guarantors must comprise not less than 70% of the total gross assets, revenue and earnings before tax and interest of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Guarantors currently comprise HMV Group plc, HMV Music Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Limited, HMV IP Limited, HMV UK Limited, HMV Ireland Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Ireland Limited and HMV Guernsey Limited.
The Company has granted security comprising first-ranking, fixed and floating charges over all the assets and undertakings of the Guarantors.
The Mean Fiddler term loan is secured on the assets of the Mean Fiddler Group of companies, which include freehold and long leasehold music and entertainment venues.
Under their banking arrangements, overdraft and cash balances of the Company and of certain subsidiaries are pooled or offset and cross-guaranteed.
Such pooling and offset arrangements are reflected in the Group balance sheet as appropriate.
Interest rate risk The Company and Group are exposed to interest rate risk from their borrowings and cash deposits.
However, without core longer term borrowings as is currently the position the strong seasonality to their trading patterns provides that, with the onset of peak trading in December, the Group moves into a net cash position for around three months before reverting to a net debt position until the following December.
As both debt and cash deposits attract a floating rate of interest, this seasonality provides a natural hedge against interest rate risk.
The net exposure is monitored on a regular basis, with consideration given to the supplemental use of interest rate hedging instruments.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk arises from its cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and outstanding receivables.
The Group deposits cash balances with counterparties that have a strong credit rating, with an agreed limit for each counterparty, so as to limit the risk of loss arising from a failure.
Counterparties include banks forming the Groups syndicated banking facility.
Trade and other receivables are regularly monitored and are limited in size due to the nature of the Groups business as a retailer dealing predominantly in cash and cash equivalents.
Allowances are made for doubtful debts based on the age of the debt and the customers financial circumstances.
The Company does not have any trade receivables.
Foreign exchange risk The Company and Group are exposed to foreign exchange risk from their investing, financing and operating activities.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the foreign exchange risk of imports where volumes are significant.
However, the Groups operating businesses generally source the majority of their products from suppliers within their country of operation and so the foreign exchange exposure is limited.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
Details of foreign currency contracts outstanding at the balance sheet date are given in Note 24.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk through its investment in overseas subsidiaries, which is partially offset by foreign currency translation risk in local debt.
Generally, the Group does not hedge any net translation exposure of overseas earnings, although it may in certain circumstances implement hedges to secure short-term financial objectives.
Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the sensitivity to changes in market variables of the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit and shareholders funds.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end, a 100 basis points movement in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax and shareholders equity by approximately 0.8m 2009: 0.1m.
The impact on the Company would have been 2.4m 2009: 0.6m.
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity The Group has a number of cash flow hedges in place, as shown in Note 24.
A 10% change in the value of hedged currencies against Sterling would affect the Groups profit before tax and shareholders equity by 0.5m 2009: 0.5m.
There would not have been any impact on the Company.

Capital management The capital of HMV Group plc is the total equity on the Groups balance sheet.
The objective of the Groups capital management is to grow its business and deliver improving returns for its shareholders.
The management of the Groups capital is performed by the Board of Directors, taking into account economic conditions and strategic requirements.
The Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made to dividend policy, which is currently to declare two payments each year, one at the Half Year of approximately 25% of the total expected dividend and the second at the Full Year.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements.
Share-based payments Equity-settled share option plan The Company has a number of share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Companys Ordinary Shares have been granted to certain Directors and management.
Options were granted at the five-day average of the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The options can normally only be exercised after three years and were subject to the achievement of earnings per share targets imposed at the date of grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the option vests or before vested options are exercised.
The charge for share options in respect of employee services during the period ended 24 April 2010 was nil 2009: nil.
There were no grants of share options during the period under review or the prior period.
The movements in the number of share options during the year are detailed in the table below.

These awards are made in shares and the number of shares awarded, together with the fair value of the award, is determined by reference to the market value of shares at the time the award is made, not when it is paid.
No adjustment to value is made for expected dividend income during the vesting period.
The deferred award normally vests following the third anniversary of the end of the financial year in which the award is made, subject to the performance of the individual.
The charge in respect of deferred awards during the period ended 24 April 2010 was 0.5m 2009: 0.4m.

The vesting awards will be settled by shares held in an Employee Benefit Trust see Note 30 and will be transferred to employees in July 2010.
Equity-settled Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP the Executive Directors and certain employees are granted an award of shares, which vest after three years provided that preset performance criteria, set by the Remuneration Committee, are met.
For awards up to and including grants made during the year ended 25 April 2009, vesting conditions were non-market related, primarily being Group earnings per share targets.
For the award granted during the year ended 24 April 2010, the vesting condition is market related, being relative total shareholder return.
The credit in respect of the PSP during the year ended 24 April 2010 was 2.0m 2009: charge of 1.3m.
A credit has arisen as management have revised their estimate of the achievability of performance conditions relating to awards vesting in future periods.

Share Incentive Plan The HMV Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP provided share-based incentives to eligible employees until closing to further participation during April 2010.
Under the SIP, employees could acquire Ordinary Shares in three ways.
Firstly, the Company can use the SIP as part of its broad incentive arrangements by awarding free shares to employees: in this regard an award of 120 free shares was made to every eligible employee on the Initial Public Offering in May 2002.
There have not been any further awards of free shares and there are no plans to award further free shares to any employees.
Secondly, the Company could invite UK employees to purchase Ordinary Shares, known as Partnership Shares, and thirdly, the Company could, if it wished, agree to match the shares purchased with additional shares, known as Matching Shares.
As at 24 April 2010 the number of shares held in Trust in respect of the SIP was 3,790,074 2009: 3,442,723.
See Note 30 for further details.
The charge in respect of the SIP during the year ended 24 April 2010 was 0.4m 2009: 0.4m.

Pension arrangements HMV Group employees are members of a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme that covers employees in the United Kingdom is the HMV Group Pension Scheme the scheme established with effect from July 1998.
The Scheme has two sections the Pension Benefit Section and the Pension Saver Section.
There is also a small defined benefit pension arrangement in Ireland, which is included in the Group amounts disclosed below, but is not included in the Company amounts.
Pension Benefit Section The Pension Benefit Section is of the defined benefit type and is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purpose of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is contracted out of SERPS.
A valuation is undertaken on at least a triennial basis by a qualified actuary.
The most recently completed actuarial valuation was as at 30 June 2007 and was based on an assumed investment return of 5.0% to 6.75% a year, salary increases of 3.0% a year, and annual pension increases of 2.5% to 3.0%, and used the projected unit method.
The result of the valuation was a level of asset cover of 94%, representing a funding deficit of 5.1m, which is being funded by three special contributions of 2.17m on 31 October 2009, 1 May 2009 and 1 May 2010.
The valuation reflected a number of changes to the Scheme effective from 1 November 2008, as follows: future increases to pensionable salaries are capped at the lower of RPI and 5% pa: pension increases in respect of service from 1 November 2008 are capped at the lower of RPI and 2.5% pa: regular funding rates increased to 21.2% of pensionable pay from 19.9% previously.
The increased regular funding is being met through higher member contributions, with the previous rate of 5.0% of pensionable pay increasing from 1 November 2008 to 6.5% for non-executive members and 10.0% for executive members, with the Groups contribution rate moving from 14.9% of pensionable pay to 14.7% for non-executive members and 22.5% for executive members: the Company has agreed to settle directly the administrative costs of the Scheme.
The curtailment of the Scheme due to the cap on pensionable salary, resulted in a 5.6m past service cost credit which was recognised in the income statement for the year ended 25 April 2009 as an exceptional item see Note 7.
The next actuarial review will take place no later than 30 June 2010.
The Pension Benefit Section was generally closed to new members with effect from 1 January 2002, with the exception of 543 members who transferred into the Scheme on 31 May 2003 from the EMI Group Pension Fund as a result of the Groups flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Benefit Section for the year ended 24 April 2010 were 2.2m 2009: 2.5m excluding the special contribution noted above of 2.17m.
In addition, a special contribution of 0.4m was made to the Groups Pension Benefit Section in Ireland.
Employer contributions to the defined benefit plans for the financial year commencing on 25 April 2010 are expected to be 2.2m, in addition to the final special contribution of 2.17m noted above and a further special contribution to the Irish scheme of Euro 0.4m.
Pension Saver Section The Pension Saver Section is of the defined contribution type and is open to all permanent and temporary staff of the Group aged between 18 and 64 years.
Members can choose to pay from 2% to 5% of pensionable pay.
The Group matches the amount paid by the member up to a maximum of 5% of pensionable pay.
Members have a choice of ways to invest their and the Groups contributions in an individual fund to buy pension benefits of their choice.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Saver Section for the year ended 24 April 2010 were 0.8m 2009: 1.1m.
In addition, employer contributions to similar pension arrangements in HMVs international businesses totalled 0.5m 2009: 0.6m.
Pension arrangements continued Defined benefit pensions Amounts reflected in the financial statements in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, Towers Watson, on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit funding method.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the respective balance sheet dates.
The major assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: As at As at 24 April 2010 25 April 2009 % per annum % per annum Rate of price inflation 3.7 3.6 Rate of salary increase 3.7 3.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.5 3.4 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 5.5 6.5 Expected rate of return on equities 8.2 8.2 Expected rate of return on bonds 5.1 6.2 Expected rate of return on index-linked bonds 4.4 4.6 The expected rate of return on Scheme assets are based on external historical and forecast market information.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions used as at both 24 April 2010 and 25 April 2009 are in line with the actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2007.
They reflect the pensioner mortality 00 series tables rated up one year and based on year of use with allowance for medium cohort improvements applying from 2000 subject to a minimum of 1% per annum.
These bases imply the following life expectancies: 2010 2010 2009 2009 At age 65 for At age 65 for At age 65 for At age 65 for someone someone someone someone currently currently currently currently Life expectancy years aged 65 aged 50 aged 65 aged 50 Male 21.5 23.0 21.4 22.9 Female 23.9 25.4 23.8 25.3 Other non-financial assumptions are also consistent with those used in the actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 June 2007.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the Scheme deficit of 17.4m, recognised on transition to IFRS and taken to other comprehensive income in the Group, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the Scheme.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Groups other comprehensive income before 25 April 2004.
