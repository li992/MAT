Halfords Group plc Online version 117 Annual Report & Accounts for period ended 2 April 2010 halfords.
Financial instruments and related disclosures Treasury policy The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: Invest surplus cash: Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group, and Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director FD.
The FD controls policy and performance through the line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee meets regularly to monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Monthly Treasury Reports provide management information relating to treasury activity.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group.
The Group has a syndicated five-year term facility totalling 300m that provides the Group with committed bank facilities until July 2011.
The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these risks is dependent upon the level of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the strength of the balance sheet.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows: Market risk The Groups exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk.
These are discussed further below.
Commodity risk is due to the Groups products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials whose prices fluctuate.
The Group mitigates this risk through, for example, transferring the risk to suppliers by negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The Groups borrowings are currently subject to floating rate and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Financial liabilities 2010 2009 Carrying Carrying amount amount m m Finance leases 12.0 12.2 Variable rate instruments 180.0 179.5 192.0 191.7 The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss or equity.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates changes: 2010 2010 2009 2009 Increase in Reduction Increase in Reduction finance cost in equity finance cost in equity m m m m 1% increase in Sterling interest rates 1.8 1.8 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movement in the income statement reflects the effect on finance costs on the unhedged borrowings of the Group as shown in the table below.
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet.
The exposure of borrowings to interest rate changes when borrowings re-price is as follows: 1 year 1-5 years Total m m m Total bank borrowings as at 2 April 2010 180.0 180.0 Total bank borrowings as at 3 April 2009 180.0 180.0 Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the trade being in US dollars.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 2 April 2010, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75%80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 12-month basis.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts, spot rates and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts: 2 April 2010 3 April 2009 GBP USD Other GBP USD Other m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 33.7 0.1 2.7 8.8 2.5 4.2 Trade and other receivables 42.9 37.6 Long term borrowings 180.0 179.5 Trade and other payables 116.2 15.0 0.3 81.3 6.2 0.3 219.6 14.9 2.4 214.4 3.7 3.9 The following significant exchange rates applied during the current and prior period: Reporting date Average rate spot rate 2010 2009 2010 2009 USD 1.60 1.63 1.53 1.48 EUR 1.13 1.20 1.13 1.10 17399 14 06 2010 Proof 7 Halfords Group plc Online version 119 Annual Report & Accounts for period ended 2 April 2010 halfords.
Financial instruments and related disclosures continued The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups derivatives are denominated.
2010 2009 Increase Increase decrease decrease in equity in equity m m 10% appreciation of the US dollar 8.4 11.5 10% depreciation of the US dollar 7.5 9.4 A strengthening of Sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 2 April 2010 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2009.
There are no material movements in the income statement.
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
Credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 m m Cash and cash equivalents 36.5 15.5 1 Loans and receivables 15.5 10.0 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging assets 3.0 14.0 Total financial assets 55.0 39.5 The 15.5m 2009: 10.0m maximum exposure to credit risk, at the reporting date for loans and receivables related to the UK.
The Group does not have any individually significant customers.
The following table shows the age of such financial assets that are past due and for which no provision for bad or doubtful debts has been raised: 2010 2009 m m Not past due 12.7 7.3 Past due by 130 days 1.4 0.9 Past due by 3190 days 0.6 0.7 Past due by 91180 days 0.8 1.1 15.5 10.0 The Group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible, based on historic payment behaviour and extensive analysis of the underlying customers credit ratings.
Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that, apart from the above, no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at 30.0m.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an A credit rating at the time of syndication July 2006.
Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the eight banks within the syndicated group.
The Treasurer is responsible for determining credit worthiness of each counterparty, based on the overall financial strength of the counterparty.
The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the syndication agent.
Reporting on covenant compliance forms part of the Treasury Report.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.
The following are the contractual maturities of non-derivative financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: 2010 Trade and Bank Finance other 2 borrowings leases payables Total m m m m Due less than one year 2.4 1.0 111.6 115.0 Expiring between 1 and 2 years 180.6 1.0 181.6 Expiring between 2 and 5 years 3.2 3.2 Expiring after 5 years 15.8 15.8 Contractual cash flows 183.0 21.0 111.6 315.6 Carrying amount 180.0 12.0 111.6 303.6 2009 Trade and Bank Finance other 2 borrowings leases payables Total m m m m Due less than one year 3.5 1.0 71.2 75.7 Expiring between 1 and 2 years 3.5 1.0 4.5 Expiring between 2 and 5 years 181.0 3.1 184.1 Expiring after 5 years 17.0 17.0 Contractual Cash Flows 188.0 22.1 71.2 281.3 Carrying amount 179.5 12.2 71.2 262.9 The following table provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows for the Groups forward currency contracts.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Fair value disclosures The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions: Trade receivables, trade payables and The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these finance lease obligations, short-term instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease obligations.
deposits and borrowings Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to markets rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the closing spot rate at the balance sheet date and the outright contract rate.
Fair Value Hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
Cash flow hedges Forward currency contracts Forward dated foreign exchange contracts are undertaken to hedge known exposure to foreign purchases in US dollars.
The fair value of such derivatives are shown in the table on page 120.
Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available during the period in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2010 2009 m m Expiring within 1 year 1.0 1.0 Expiring between 1 and 2 years 120.0 Expiring between 2 and 5 years 120.0 121.0 121.0 The facilities expiring within one year were annual facilities subject to review at various dates during the period.
The facility of 120.0m relates to the Groups revolving credit facility, which was arranged to help finance the proposed expansion of the Groups activities.
All these facilities incurred commitment fees at market rates.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Between June 2006 and September 2009, the Group managed its capital structure partly through a share buy-back scheme, details of which are given in Note 21.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios.
These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA and fixed charge cover.
Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net debt and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges.
Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges.
As a result of the current economic conditions and the attitude towards debt the Group has decided to reduce the level of net debt and operates favourably to these target metrics.
