FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups banking facilities require hedging of 70% of the funds drawn under the investment tranche of its core banking facility.
The Group has complied with this during the year.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
Balance sheet management The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group seeks to have a conservative gearing ratio the proportion of net debt to equity.
The Board considers at each review the appropriateness of the current ratio in light of the above.
The Board is currently satisfied with the Groups gearing ratio.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Debt 300,000 311,339 Cash and cash equivalents 30,619 3,222 Net debt 269,381 308,117 Balance sheet equity 547,285 502,317 Net debt to equity ratio 49.2% 61.3% Debt is defined as long-term and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 19.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
Net debt is defined as gross bank borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Debt management The Group borrows through a senior term loan, secured on its existing store portfolio.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short term liquidity.
Funding is arranged in the Group and in Big Yellow Limited Partnership through banks and financial institutions with whom the Group has a strong working relationship.
C. Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group has two interest rate derivatives in place: 120 million fixed at 2.99% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until September 2015 and 70 million fixed at 3.93% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument also until September 2015.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is one month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
The loss in the income statement for the year of these interest rate swaps was 2,430,000 2009: loss of 3,075,000.
A further income statement charge arose in the year of 245,000 in respect of the fair value movement of derivative positions that were extended in March 2010.
A further income statement charge arose in the prior year of 14,892,000 in respect of the fair value movement of derivative positions that were closed out in March 2009.
The fair value of the above derivatives at 31 March 2010 was a liability of 7,980,000 2009: liability of 5,550,000.
87 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2010 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings, without jeopardising its flexibility.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2010, it is estimated that an increase of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have reduced the Groups annual profit before tax by 550,000 2009: increased loss before tax by 606,500 and a decrease of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have increased the Groups annual profit before tax by 550,000 2009: reduced loss before tax by 606,500.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
In the prior year, a 1 percentage point increase decrease was used, however, given monthly LIBOR is currently 0.54%, the Board considered it appropriate to reduce this measure.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the year, following the repayment of floating rate debt from cash resources.
E. Cash management and liquidity Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
F. Foreign currency management The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
G. Credit risk The credit risk management policies of the Group with respect to trade receivables are discussed in note 16.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 30,500 customers in our stores.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
H. Financial maturity analysis In respect of interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table provides a maturity analysis for individual elements.
2010 Maturity Less than One to Two to More than Total one year two years five years five years 000 000 000 000 000 Debt Bank loan payable at variable rate 110,000 110,000 Debt fixed by interest rate derivatives 190,000 190,000 Total 300,000 300,000 2009 Maturity Less than One to Two to More than Total one year two years five years five years 000 000 000 000 000 Debt Bank loan payable at variable rate 121,339 121,339 Debt fixed by interest rate derivatives 190,000 190,000 Total 311,339 311,339 The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has reduced during the year, following the repayment of 11.3 million of floating rate debt during the year.
The Board monitors closely the exposure to the floating rate element of our debt.

The loan is due to expire on 15 September 2013.
The facility is secured on a first charge of 51 of the Groups properties and is subject to certain covenants.
The facility is divided into two tranches, Tranche A, up to a maximum of 50 million is used to finance non-stabilised properties within the Group and carries a margin of 150 bps.
Tranche B is used to finance stabilised Group properties, and carries a margin of between 112.5 bps and 150 bps dependent on the Tranche B income cover.
The Group is currently paying a margin of 112.5 bps on this Tranche.
As the properties within Tranche A stabilise, they can be transferred to Tranche B, reducing the margin payable.
The facilitys principal covenant is an income cover covenant that requires Tranche B EBITDA to be greater than 1.4 times the interest cost in Tranche B.
The Group is also required to retain consolidated net assets of 250 million: and a net debt to net assets ratio of less than 1.3 to 1.
