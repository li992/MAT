introduction our strateGy our perFormance our impact on society Governance Financial statements section 6 Financial statements 141 25. retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
Defined contribution benefits are based on the amount of contributions paid in respect of an individual member, the investment returns earned and the amount of pension this money will buy when a member retires.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
From 1 November 2006, all sections of the UK Group plan were closed to new members with the exception ofadefined contribution section that was opened in 2003.
This section is available to all new employees of participating companies.
The other major defined benefit plans are based in the US.
Other defined contribution plans are operated principally overseas with the largest plan being in the US.
Thespecific features of these plans vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which employees arelocated.
Pearson also has several post-retirement medical benefit plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to defined benefit pension plans.
assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.
2010 2009 uK Group other uK Group other % plan plans prmB plan plans prmB Inflation 3.5 2.5 2.5 3.5 2.5 2.5 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 5.5 5.1 5.1 5.7 5.3 5.5 Expected return on assets 6.0 6.6 6.0 6.8 Expected rate of increase in salaries 4.7 4.0 5.0 4.0 Expected rate of increase for pensions in 2.6 2.6 payment and deferred pensions to 4.4 to 4.4 Initial rate of increase in healthcare rate 8.0 8.5 Ultimate rate of increase in healthcare rate 5.0 5.0 The UK discount rate is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15-year AA-rated corporate bond index, adjusted to reflect the duration of liabilities.
The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
Theexpected return on assets is based on market expectations of long-term asset returns for the defined portfolio at the endof the year.
The inflation rate of 3.5% reflects the RPI rate.
In line with changes to legislation certain benefits have been calculated with reference to CPI as the inflationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.8% has been used.
The change from RPI to CPI for deferred revaluation and Post 88 GMP pension increases in payment has been included in these results, resulting in a gain of 23m, taken as an actuarial gain on the obligation.
The expected rates of return on categories of plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio, plus a diversification premium.
The expected rate of increase in salaries has been set at 4.7% for 2010 with a short-term assumption of 3.3% for twoyears.

In 2009 the Group changed its mortality assumptions in the UK.
Themortality base table assumptions have been derived from the SAPS all pensioners tables for males and the SAPS normal health pensioners tables for females, adjusted to reflect the observed experience of the plan, with medium cohort improvement factors.
In 2008 a 1% improvement floor on the medium cohort was applied.
In 2009 this was changed to 1.5% for males and 1.25% for females, with tapering.
For the US plans, the assumptions used were based on standard US mortality tables.
In 2008 a switch from GAM94 to RP2000 was made, to reflect the mortality assumption now more prevalent in the US, and in 2010 a10year projection was added.
Using the above tables, the remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: uK us 2010 2009 2010 2009 Male 22.8 22.7 18.4 17.6 Female 23.6 23.5 20.6 20.2 The remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date, for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: uK us 2010 2009 2010 2009 Male 25.4 25.3 18.4 17.6 Female 25.7 25.6 20.6 20.2 Financial statement information The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2010 defined uK Group benefit defined all figures in millions plan other sub-total contribution prmB total Current service cost 21 2 23 68 2 93 Curtailments 5 5 5 total operating expense 16 2 18 68 2 88 Expected return on plan assets 93 7 100 100 Interest on plan liabilities 100 9 109 3 112 net finance expense 7 2 9 3 12 net income statement charge 23 4 27 68 5 100 actual return on plan assets 177 13 190 190 introduction our strateGy our perFormance our impact on society Governance Financial statements section 6 Financial statements 143 25. retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued 2009 defined uK Group benefit defined all figures in millions plan other sub-total contribution prmB total Current service cost 14 3 17 62 2 81 Past service cost 1 1 1 total operating expense 14 4 18 62 2 82 Expected return on plan assets 83 5 88 88 Interest on plan liabilities 89 8 97 3 100 net finance expense 6 3 9 3 12 net income statement charge 20 7 27 62 5 94 actual return on plan assets 136 8 144 144 Included within the 2010 results are discontinued operations of 5m relating to the curtailment credit, a 1mcharge relating to defined benefit schemes and a 2m charge relating to defined contribution schemes 2009:2m charge relating to defined benefit schemes and 2m charge relating to defined contribution schemes.

The trustees of the plan are required to act in the best interest of the plans beneficiaries.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was completed as at 1 January 2009 and this valuation revealed a funding shortfall.
TheGroup has agreed that the funding shortfall will be eliminated by 31 December 2020.
In 2010 the Group contributed 41m 2009: 42m towards the funding shortfall and has agreed to contribute a similar amount perannum until 2020 in excess of regular contributions.
Regular contributions to the plan are estimated to be 22m for 2011.
Under UK law section 75 debt a company that participates in a multi-employer defined benefit plan is liable, on withdrawal from that pension plan, for its share of the total deficit in the plan calculated on a solvency or buy out basis.
The Interactive Data sale and the termination of Interactive Data Corporation Europe Ltds participation in the UK Group plan triggered this section 75 liability.
68m was contributed to the plan in respect of this liability.
The Group expects to contribute $94m in 2011 and $97m in 2012 to its US pension plans.
sensitivities The net retirement benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions, the most significant being the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation and the total pension expense is as follows: 2010 all figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease effect on: Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 262.0 324.0 Decrease increase of aggregate of service cost and interest cost UK Group plan 13.7 16.3 Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation US plan 2.5 1.3
