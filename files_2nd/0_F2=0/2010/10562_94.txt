In 2009 there was a curtailment gain of 0.7 million in Europe arose as a result of two medaille du travail arrangements in France being withdrawn.
The unrecognised past service cost in France is as a result of a change in future benefit accrual and is being amortised over 13 years.
In the UK, there was a change in the statutory measure of indexation for some pension benefits from the Retail Prices Index RPI to the Consumer Prices Index CPI, this resulted in an actuarial gain of 6.5m which has been accounted for as a change of assumptions.

In placing a current estimate on the Companys past service benefit obligations, a number of assumptions about the future are required.
For defined benefit schemes, the Directors make annual estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life expectancy.
In making these estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was 6.0 million 2009: 3.9 million.

Employee benefits continued Performance criteria for Long Term Incentive Plan 2004, Directors Share Option Plan 2006 and Executive Share Option Scheme 2004.
For awards granted from 2004 to 2006 inclusive, the extent to which awards vested depended on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR ranking against the TSR of the other companies in the FTSE 350 measured over the performance period.
If the Companys TSR placed it at the median, then 30% of the awards would vest on the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
If the Companys TSR placed it at the upper quartile, then 100% of the option would vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Between the median and upper quartile, the option would vest on a straight-line basis.
Below the median, none of the shares would vest.
In 2007 additional performance criteria were attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004.
The TSR performance criteria referred to above now only relate to 50% of awards made.
The extent to which the other 50% of these awards vest will depend on the Companys earnings per share EPS compared with the Retail Price Index RPI.
The full 50% will vest if, over the three-year performance period, the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 10% pa.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and between 4% and 10% pa then the proportion of awards vesting will be interpolated between 15% and 50%.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 4% pa then 15% of the awards will vest.
If the Companys EPS increases by less than the sum of the RPI increase and 4% pa then 0% of the awards will vest.
In 2008 further changes were made to the performance criteria attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 for awards made in 2008 and onwards.
For all participants excluding executive Directors the TSR performance criteria referred to above now only relate to 33.3% of awards made.
The extent to which the other 66.7% of these awards vest will depend on the Companys EPS compared with the RPI.
The full 66.7% will vest if, over the three-year performance period, the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 10% pa.
For executive Director participants the conditions remain unchanged from 2007.
In 2009 further changes were made to the performance criteria attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004.
For all participants the TSR performance criteria referred to above related to 100.0% of awards made.
In 2010 the performance criteria attached to the awards granted pursuant to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 reverted to a TSR EPS split.
The TSR performance criteria relate to 50% of awards made.
The extent to which the other 50% of these awards vest will depend on the Companys EPS compared with the RPI.
In addition, the 2010 LTIP awards were restructured to include an HMRC-approved element as part of the overall LTIP award.
In addition, an improvement must be shown in the Companys underlying financial performance.
Performance criteria for The Morgan Crucible Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan The extent to which awards will vest will depend on the Companys EPS compared with the RPI.
Participants are able to defer up to 75% of their annual bonus into Company shares, subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee.
Under the 2008 grant, the Remuneration Committee allowed participants to defer up to 50% of their annual bonus into Company shares.
Participants must hold the deferred shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award.
Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that a stretching EPS target has been met.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 15% pa then matching shares equal to three times the deferred shares will be earned.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and between 4% and 10% pa then the proportion of awards will be interpolated between 0.25x deferred shares and 1.75x deferred shares.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 4% pa then matching shares equal to 0.25x deferred shares will be earned.

Employee benefits continued In 2009 additional criteria were attached to the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan.
Under the 2009 grant, the Remuneration Committee allowed participants to defer up to 50% of their annual bonus into Company shares.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than 15% pa then matching shares equal to three times the deferred shares will be earned.
If the Companys EPS increases by between 4% and 10% pa then the proportion of awards will be interpolated between 0.25x deferred shares and 1.75x deferred shares.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than 4% pa then matching shares equal to 0.25x deferred shares will be earned.
If the Companys EPS increases by less than 4% pa then 0% of the awards will vest.
In 2010, the Remuneration Committee allowed participants to defer up to 75% of their annual bonus into Company shares.
Performance criteria for the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 The diluted earnings per share for the Company must grow by at least 2% pa in excess of RPI over the period of date of grant to date of vesting.
The fair values of services received are in return for awards made and share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on an appropriate model as shown in accounting policy note n. In the case of the Binomial Lattice model and Monte Carlo model the contractual life of the options and awards are used as an input.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into both of these models.

The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range nil to 249.00 pence and a weighted average contractual life of 0.5 years.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimates of the fair value of the services received is measured based on either a Monte Carlo model, a Binomial Lattice option pricing model or a Black-Scholes Merton model.
The choice of model takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The weighted average fair value of options issued in the period was 145.92 pence 2009: 58.95 pence.
The IFRS 2 fair value charge expensed to the income statement was 3.1 million 2009: 2.0 million.
