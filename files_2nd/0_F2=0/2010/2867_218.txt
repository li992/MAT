In addition to the assets and liabilities of the underlying Syndicate, Cobex has in place a quota share arrangement with its insurance partners such that only 8.86% of any profit or loss declared by the Syndicate, in respect of Cobex, would be attributable to the Group.
The Group has no rights over the assets or liabilities of the Syndicate other than to the extent that it will receive distributed profits or contribute to relieve losses.
The Group has in place a letter of credit amounting to 1.0m 2009: 1.0m which is the maximum exposure that the Group has to losses generated within the Syndicate.
18 Business combinations The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2010 which are shown in aggregate.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are disclosed in the table below: Fair value to Group recognised on acquisition m Intangible assets 119.4 Property, plant and equipment 7.3 Deferred tax 9.6 Debtors 128.0 Bank loans and overdrafts 7.2 Finance leases 1.6 Creditors 118.4 Long term debt 109.6 Provisions 2.1 Corporation tax 1.8 Net assets 23.6 Goodwill arising on acquisition 195.4 219.0 Discharged by: Cash 200.8 Contingent consideration accrued 18.2 219.0 A further 31.8m was added to goodwill in relation to deferred tax on the intangible assets valued at acquisition.
During the year the Group has completed a number of acquisitions which are shown in aggregate above.
In all cases 100% of the ordinary share capital was acquired and the consideration satisfied in cash.
The companies acquired have been mainly in the areas of Health, Property and IT and complement or extend the Groups existing skill sets and provide opportunities for growth into the Health market.
In addition during the year the Group settled deferred consideration payments with regard to previous acquisitions amounting to 3.7m, of which 1.8m was accrued.
The impact of this was to increase goodwill by 1.9m.
During the year some of the acquired businesses have been completely integrated into the existing businesses of the Group and therefore their post-acquisition performance cannot be determined.
In aggregate for the year, the other acquired subsidiaries contributed 12.3m to the profit before tax of the Group.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2010, Group revenue would have been an estimated 2,924.0m and Group profit before tax would have been an estimated 324.1m.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2010. Business Review Governance Accounts The Capita Group Plc 113 18 Business combinations continued Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition because the fair value of the acquired assets was lower than the consideration paid: the goodwill represents the value to the Group that can be driven from these underlying assets over the life of the acquired businesses.
Contingent consideration The Group has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post-acquisition.
These performance periods are of 2 years duration and will be settled in cash on their payment date on achieving the relevant target.
The estimated range of the additional consideration payment is estimated to be between 15m and 20m.
The group has included 18.2m as contingent consideration related to the additional consideration, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighing the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
There is further deferred consideration accrued of 1.7m in respect of acquisitions in previous years and these are expected to be paid in the forthcoming year.
Fair values remain provisional in relation to the acquisitions that were completed in the final quarter of 2010.
The Group will complete this review in the first quarter of 2011, any adjustment to the carrying value is unlikely to be significant to the individual acquisition.
Acquisition related costs The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 6.5m related to professional fees paid for due diligence, general professional fees and legal advice.
These costs have been included in administrative expenses in the Groups consolidated income statement.
A further 0.3m was incurred with regard to acquisitions in the previous year and this has resulted in a 0.3m increase in goodwill.
2009 acquisitions The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2009 which are shown in aggregate.
The book and fair values of the assets acquired are disclosed in the table below: Fair value Fair value Book values adjustments to Group m m m Intangible assets 10.1 72.2 82.3 Property, plant and equipment 5.9 5.9 Deferred tax 5.9 20.9 15.0 Debtors 59.6 0.4 59.2 Cash and short term deposits 24.2 24.2 Creditors 96.7 0.5 97.2 Long term debt 9.1 9.1 Provisions 2.2 2.2 Corporation tax 1.9 1.9 Net assets 2.0 48.2 46.2 Goodwill arising on acquisition 159.3 205.5 Discharged by: Cash 196.4 Deferred consideration paid 0.7 Deferred consideration accrued 8.4 205.5 Included within the table above are the net assets of Synetrix Holdings Limited of 7.1m, including recognised intangible assets of 28.1m.
The cash consideration paid was 77.6m with resulting goodwill of 70.5m.
Intangible valuations relating to this acquisition had been performed on a provisional basis and the exercise was completed in the subsequent year.
The performance of these acquisitions post their inclusion in the Group could not be ascertained as they had been fully integrated within existing offerings.
Acquisitions in the year included FMS Netherlands B. V. CHKS Limited, Hero Insurance Services Limited, MMB Associates Limited, Gissings Holdings Limited, Carillion IT Services Limited now know as Capita IT Services Limited, Fidei Fiduciaire S.. r. l, IMMO Guillaume Schneider S. A. IMMO J.
A S. A. Multi-Tech Group Limited and Synetrix Holdings Limited.

Within goodwill are certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquirees and could not be measured reliably.
These items include client loyalty and the assembled workforce.
