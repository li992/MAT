Notes to the financial statements Corporate governance Financial statements 1 Segmental analysis Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the Misys Operations Team, comprising the Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and all Executive Vice Presidents.
The Misys Operations Team is responsible for resources allocation and assessing the performance of the operating segments.
The operating segments are defined by distinctly separate product offerings or markets.
The operating segments consist of Allscripts, Banking, Treasury & Capital Markets TCM and Open Source.
The Corporate & others category includes Open Source and corporate costs as these operations are not reportable segments as required to be disclosed under IFRS 8.
Corporate was previously known as Central Services.
Global Services is considered as a horizontal function with performance assessed by the CODM in each of the defined operating segments.
Certain costs within the Corporate & others segment are allocated to the other reportable segments based on revenue.
Costs allocated to Allscripts are based on a shared service agreement between the Group and Allscripts.

Annual Report 2010 | Misys plc 83 Notes to the financial statements Overview Business review 1 Segmental analysis continued All revenue is derived from external customers.
Revenue from no individual customer exceeded 10% of total Group revenue in the current or prior year.
The Corporate & others charge has decreased from 21.6m to 12.7m due principally to procurement and efficiency savings introduced during 2009.
In addition, costs in relation to translation exchange differences recycled from reserves have decreased by 1.3m.
Revenue The table below gives a list of the revenue streams by segment.
For further details of the products and services, refer to the accounting policies and financial review sections.
During the year, Misys signed a contract with a customer to vary the terms of an existing contract and to grant the customer flexibility over the future use of its software.
The consideration included a variation fee of 6.0m which has been classified as ILF revenue.
As this is a variation fee, there will be no incremental maintenance fees chargeable going forward.

The adjustment in 2009 relates to finalising the purchase price allocation under IFRS 3.
Significant cash generating units Goodwill relating to the Banking 19.9m 2009: 22.6m, TCM 39.0m 2009: 33.3m, and Allscripts 260.0m 2009: 235.6m groups of cash generating units CGUs are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying amount of goodwill assets at 31 May 2010.
The recoverable amounts of the Banking and TCM CGUs were determined based on value-in-use calculations and no impairment was identified during the year.
The recoverable amount of Allscripts CGU was determined using a fair value less costs to sell calculation and no impairment was identified during the year.
Where the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations, these calculations use pre-tax cash flows for each CGU based on approved budgets and management forecasts which are consistent with the recent financial performance of the relevant CGU.
For all of the value-in-use calculations, it was not necessary to look at cash flows beyond five years as cash flows within this time horizon were significantly in excess of the carrying amounts of the CGUs and hence no terminal value was assigned.
Direct and indirect costs and corporate overheads have been calculated using the same percentage of revenue as for the recent budget which incorporates planned margin improvement.
Management determined budgeted operating margins based on past performance and its expectations of market development as outlined in the business review section.
Sensitivity analyses have been performed around the base case assumptions with the conclusion that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying amount.
For Banking value-in-use calculations, the first three years cash flows were based on budget and management forecasts and thereafter growth rates as reflected in the table below were used.
For TCM value-in-use calculations, the first three years were based on budget and management forecasts and thereafter growth rates based on current and expected future performance as reflected in the table below.
The following assumptions have been used in order to determine recoverable amounts based on value-in-use calculations: Growth Growth rates for rates for Pre-tax cash flows cash flows discount CGU years 1 3 years 4 5 rate Banking 0 12% 3% 10.4% TCM 7 10% 8% 10% 12.1% The Allscripts impairment review compared the Misys share of the market capitalisation of Allscripts as at 31 May 2010 less estimated disposal costs against the net book value of the CGU.
No reasonable movement in the share price would result in an impairment of goodwill.
The proposed disposal of Allscripts is described in more detail in note 39.
94 Misys plc | Annual Report 2010 Corporate governance Financial statements 16 Goodwill continued Acquisition of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. On 10 October 2008, the Group acquired 56.8% of the issued share capital of Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc. for a cash consideration, including expenses, both paid and accrued, of 200.8m $330m plus related expenses.
As part of the acquisition, 100% ownership of Misys Healthcare Systems was transferred to Allscripts.
An analysis of the net assets acquired is shown below: Final fair Provisional value fair value Book Fair value at 31 May at 31 May All figures in millions value adjustment 2010 2009 Intangible assets 70.3 69.2 139.5 139.5 Property, plant and equipment 13.0 1.8 11.2 11.2 Deferred tax liabilities 23.4 24.9 1.5 3.0 Cash 45.4 45.4 45.4 Other assets 68.9 0.3 68.6 68.6 Other liabilities 113.6 7.6 106.0 107.5 Net assets acquired 107.4 49.8 157.2 154.2 Minority interest 67.9 66.6 Misys shareholders interest 89.3 87.6 Goodwill 202.9 204.7 Total consideration 292.2 292.3 Total consideration of 292.2m includes the cash consideration of 200.8m including directly attributable expenses of 7.1m and the fair value attributed to the 43.2% net disposal of Misys Healthcare of 91.4m.
The original fair value adjustments contained provisional amounts which have now been finalised.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions is principally attributable to the anticipated profitability achieved through perceived cost and revenue synergies.
The fair value adjustments are based on an independent valuation at the time of acquisition and primarily relate to identified intangible assets technology, relationships and brand name, deferred revenue and related deferred tax.
In accordance with IFRS 3, the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities was determined provisionally as at 10 October 2008.
Given the complexity of the acquisition, additional information was obtained as part of the process of finalising the purchase price allocation during the 12 month period allowed under IFRS 3.
This resulted in certain aspects of the purchase price allocation being revisited to reflect finalisation of the allocation process.
The table above shows the fair values for the prior periods at the reported amounts.
These have been restated in the relevant balance sheets.

33 Financial instruments: risk management Misys operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types, transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash, short term deposits, bank loans, overdrafts, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investment in foreign operations.
Management has established a policy requiring Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
The Group companies must manage their exposure to exchange differences both recognised and anticipated.
Group companies are required to hedge any significant transactions which create foreign exchange exposures with Group treasury when a transaction becomes a contractual commitment to pay or receive funds at a future date.
Group treasury reviews these exposures on a regular basis.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, the entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted with Group treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
External foreign exchange contracts are used to economically hedge foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The consolidated foreign exchange exposure of Group treasury activities will be economically hedged by Group treasury within limits agreed in the Group treasury policy.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currency risk is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in note 37.
104 Misys plc | Annual Report 2010 Corporate governance Financial statements 33 Financial instruments: risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans, overdrafts and cash held on deposit.
The Groups borrowings are primarily at variable interest rates set for periods of six months or less.
Based on the various scenarios, the Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate hedging instruments such as caps or swaps which are used to protect the Group against significant increases in interest rates.
Under the interest rate swap, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the specified swap rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
The Groups cash balances are kept in interest bearing current accounts and on short-term deposit to maximise the level of return while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity.
The Group does not generally invest surplus funds in long-term fixed interest securities and therefore its exposure to fair value interest rate risk is not generally significant.
The Groups net exposure to interest rate risk is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in note 37. Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions but primarily from outstanding trade receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative and cash transactions are limited to high-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
For customer contracts, the Group and each reporting subsidiary have specified risk control and authorisation procedures in place to assess the credit quality of a customer.
Where there is no independent risk rating for a customer, such an assessment takes into account financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of customers and counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters set by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
The long term forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under current and projected committed borrowing facilities.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities.

The fair value of trade payables acquired as part of the Allscripts transaction was reduced by 0.2m from the value reported at 31 May 2009.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity and note 32.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as a going concern while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group, excluding Allscripts, is subject to certain financial covenants on its funding facility and monitors capital largely on this basis.
This includes a maximum ratio of net borrowings to operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals EBITDA of 2.5 times and a minimum ratio of EBITDA to net interest of 5.0 times.
At 31 May 2010, the net borrowings to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.2 2009: 1.6 times and EBITDA to net interest payable ratio as defined in the loan agreement was 9.6 2009: 10.6.
The covenants were met during and at the end of the year.
34 Financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investment in foreign operations.
The Group is also exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from floating rate bank loans, overdrafts and cash held on deposit.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The fair value of foreign exchange derivatives at 31 May 2010 was a net liability of 0.1m 2009: 0.1m.
Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation During the prior year, the Groups US dollar denominated borrowing was designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Groups US subsidiaries.
However, before last year end the US dollar loan was repaid in full.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges in the prior year.

As required under IFRS 3, Misys has reassessed and finalised the provisional allocation of the Allscripts purchase price within the allowed 12 month period since the acquisition date and has restated the opening balances accordingly.
Fair value measurement hierarchy Fair value measurements of financial instruments where relevant are classified using the following fair value hierarchy which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 input other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
These instruments are included in level 1 and comprise investments in quoted marketable securities.
