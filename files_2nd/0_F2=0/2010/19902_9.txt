Unite 16 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 The outlook for 2011 is more positive.
So far this year, UMS has secured two external Business review contracts to build modules for Travelodge hotels and is in advanced discussions to continued secure a number of other external contracts.
UMS will also supply approximately 800 modules to UNITE for its 2012 pipeline taking its forecast production to 1,800 modules for 2011 compared to 1,100 for 2010.
Demand will again be seasonal with revenues anticipated to be much higher in the second half than the first.
Year on year performance at UMS should, however, be materially better.
Our financial position The Group has delivered growth against each of its key financial targets in 2010 with a 3.5 million improvement in net portfolio contribution and an 11% growth in adjusted net asset value per share fully diluted.
This positive performance has been driven by an improvement in occupancy rates and further rental growth, which increased the value of the investment portfolio.
In addition, the Group has recognised development profits from some of the new developments that it has the secured pipeline is added to its pipeline.
As expected, the yield compression that has been expected to add approximately experienced in the broader commercial real estate sector has been less marked 69 million of future nAV in the student accommodation sector, with yields broadly stable during the year.

student accommodation, reflecting its largely non-cyclical nature.
income Statement The Group has continued to place greater emphasis on growing its profit from the 69m operational business which it measures through net portfolio contribution.
This has improved to 4.1 million in 2010 from 0.6 million in 2009 and a loss of 5.4 million in future nAV from secured pipeline 2008.
This strong progress reflects our continued focus on building a robust and scaleable operational platform that, together with the ongoing growth of the portfolio, will continue to improve the profitability of the Group.
The highlights from the income statement are as follows: Growth in income from the managed portfolio of 15% driven by higher occupancy, rental growth and new beds: Growth in UNITEs share of rental income up 9%, despite its share of total income reducing to 47% from 50% following the sale of assets to USAF: Gross margin remained at 70% as increased utility costs were offset with othersavings: Management fees received increased to 8.4 million from 5.9 million as assets under management grew to 1.9 billion from 1.6 billion in 2009: Financing costs increased from 43.0 million to 46.8 million due to higher levels of investment borrowings, a full year of new lease commitments and a higher average cost of debt: Overheads have been held in line with the 2009 position, and we anticipate that no further significant increases will be required to manage the secured development pipeline once it is completed.

The difference between NPC and the adjusted profit loss is largely the impact of the Development Segment.
The key components of the Development Segment are pre-contract costs of 3.2 million which are up from 0.7 million in 2009 due to the increase in development activity, losses at UNITE Modular Solutions of 4.8 million as a result of its surplus capacity, and profits generated from the sale of assets to USAF, net of write-downs of trading assets, amounting to 6.9 million.

Balance Sheet Adjusted net asset value has increased to 474 million or 295 pence per share at 31 December 2010, up from 423 million or 265 pence per share at 31 December 2009.
The growth in value has been driven by rental growth on stabilised properties of 3.1% in the year and value added to the development pipeline from planning consents received and construction progress across the pipeline.
Reported net asset value, which includes interest rate swap values and some properties at cost, attributable to UNITE shareholders was 388 million at 31December 2010 31 December 2009: 366 million.

Unite 19 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Case study Leeds Students Universities employees Investors Communities It is an unfortunate reality that students can be a target for crime and all UNITE properties have security teams in place who work closely with the emergency services in the event of an incident.
In Leeds, our security team has become a lead partner for the University and Metropolitan Polices Police Walk Safe campaign to combat crime against students.
Police Walk Safe identifies and combats known crime hot spots by increasing patrols in these areas.
Our security team has provided training for Community Support Officers to pass on our experience of working with students and maps out the areas the UNITE team covers so that the police authority can make the best use of its resources.
Our security operatives also support the police and local authorities during Freshers Week to safeguard students and the wider community.
The success of Police Walk Safe has helped us form a close partnership with the universities in Leeds and we sit on the University Crime Prevention Committee to assess the security needs for the citys students.
The UNITE security team has been commended by the Inspector of the Neighbourhood Policing Team and we are recognised as professional body within the community that can assist with crime prevention and creating safer environments.
Our Leeds team is exchanging best practice with other UNITE city teams and helping us develop similar relationships with Universities and local police authorities across the country.

The Board is satisfied that this target level of continued gearing, which is above that of many other listed real estate companies, is appropriate for UNITEs business.
Student accommodation valuations have historically been significantly less volatile than those for general commercial property: for example, they only fell by approximately 13% during the financial crisis compared to a wider fall in commercial property values of 44% over thesame period.
Consequently, the Board believes that UNITEs portfolio is ableto support a slightly higher level of gearing than other commercial real estate companies.
Financing By working closely with its banking partners, UNITE has been able to make significant progress against its core financing objectives of extending debt maturities and securing new development finance.
Adjusted net Asset Value has increased to 295 pence per The Group and its co-investment vehicles secured over 65 million of new development facilities and 135 million of new investment debt in 2010 of which share 2009: 265 pence 75 million was from new lenders.
Importantly, the Group has also extended the pershare maturity of 120 million of existing facilities.
UNITE is continuing to see the benefits of working closely with key relationship banks who have continued to place great importance on the UNITE brand and track record of delivering schemes on time and to budget, and stabilising assets in the first 12 to 24 months of operation, together with its strong balance sheet.
11% increase in adjusted net Asset Value In doing so, the Group has reduced the level of refinancing requirements in 2013 and 2014 from 360 million to 260 million and demonstrated its ability to continue to access appropriate forms of funding.
Looking forward, the Group and its coinvestment vehicles will continue to focus on extending debt maturities and will look to structure longer term facilities around core property holdings to provide greater certainty over funding arrangements.

As at 31 December, the Group had a total of 60million of cash being used to pay down unconditionally committed facilities that can be drawn.
Taken together with its cash balances, this provides an effective cash balance of 83 million.
The weighted average cost of debt has increased in line with the increase in proportion of investment debt hedged, which has risen following the sale of assets to USAF and the decision to pay down floating rate debt in order to avoid crystallising swap mark to market losses.
Unite 21 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 The following chart sets out the debt maturity profile of the Groups facilities and shows the progress that has been made over the past three years in reducing thequantum of debt maturing between 2011 and 2014.
The chart highlights the 100million reduction in debt maturing in 2013 and 2014 being replaced by additional capacity in 2015 and 2016.
UNITE will continue to work with banks and other providers of debt finance to extend and structure debt in line with asset strategies.

UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund USAF generated a total return of 11.2% in 2010, ranking it as the third best performing fund in the IPD Index for Pooled Funds measured over a three year period.
The Fund acquired a 25 million asset from a third party in August and a portfolio of 146 million from UNITE in November at an average yield of 6.4%.
The Fund is likely to make further selective acquisitions whilst managing its gearing at or around its current level of 50% loan to value.
The market for USAF units through the secondary market has continued to develop with approximately 30 million of units traded during the year at an average premium of 2% to net asset value.
There have been no requests for unit redemptions.
There has been no material movement on the recovery of the Landsbanki deposit.
Whilst USAF has been confirmed as a Priority Creditor and therefore should recover the majority of its deposit, the Resolution Committee that is overseeing the bank hastaken longer to determine the status of many creditors and is currently facing anumber of test legal cases in the Icelandic Courts.
Given the timing and uncertainty as a result of the test cases, the deposit remains fully provided for.
UCC has fully invested all of its equity continued and will continue to focus on the operation of its investment assets and any asset management opportunities within its estate.
As the vehicle matures in 2013, UNITE and GIC Real Estate, its joint venture partner, are beginning to consider the most appropriate future strategy for these investments.
Oasis Capital Bank Joint Venture The three schemes in the joint venture comprising 1,129 beds were successfully completed within budget and are 90% occupied for the current academic year.
The joint venture is focused on ensuring that the assets reach stabilised rental and occupancy levels over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.
UNITE Student Village Joint Venture USV, which owns one building in Sheffield, is a joint venture with Lehmans Brothers A total return of 11.2% which is now in administration.
The administrators have indicated that they intend to continue holding their 49% share in the joint venture whilst an exit strategy is in2010for USAF formulated.
Whilst the joint venture agreement technically matured in 2009, any termination is subject to the pre-emption provisions in the agreement.
Debt facilities in co-investment facilities 3rd The co-investment facilities have adjusted net debt to property assets of 54%.
The 2011 facility maturities relate to a single facility in each of our USV and OCB joint best performing fund in iPD index ventures and the Group is comfortable that acceptable terms to extend or replace these facilities will be available.

The Group anticipates tax charges will remain low in 2011 and 2012 as only this element of profits is likely to result in a tax charge.
Resources and relationships UNITEs financial and operational performance has been underpinned by the core systems, processes and approaches developed and fine-tuned over the years.
In 2010 the Group upgraded its unique online booking system, which facilitated the check-in process for the largest number of students in the Companys history duringSeptember.
The data maintained on this system provides UNITE with a comprehensive insight into the make-up of its customer base which enables tailored improvements to the Groups product and service offering.
The strength of the UNITE brand and the Groups reputation for financial stability has further consolidated its position in the market, both in terms of the capacity to raise capital the 67 million debt facility agreed with Barclays for our Moonraker Alley development was the largest facility of its type approved by the bank during the year, and success in working with planning authorities to receive consent for new and complex development schemes such as Waterloo Road in Southwark, which achieved consent in only six months.
Through close relationships with several key banks, the Group has also been abletoimprove its debt maturity profile and refinance existing debt facilities atcompetitive rates.

This in-house capability will provide even closer alignment of service functions with the Groups customers.
Undoubtedly the Groups greatest resource is its staff: UNITE has a vibrant, passionate and committed workforce, and works hard to develop and retain itspeople.
The Companys employee engagement figures are measured independently and compare extremely favourably with similar organisations, anda number of activities delivered through the year raised levels of capability and motivation yet higher.
Central to the Groups long-term vision is to create a business which meets and exceeds the expectations of its key stakeholders.
Throughout 2010, UNITE has USAF acquired a 25 million placed a stronger focus on understanding the challenges and needs of students, asset from a third party in universities, employees, communities and investors to ensure it is able to work effectively with and provide value for each group.

the Fund is likely to make Looking forward further selective acquisitions It has been clear for some time that the next decade for the student accommodation whilst managing its gearing sector will be very different to the last one.
A more modest outlook for student ator around its current level number growth and a dramatically changed financial environment mean that the nature of opportunity in the sector will be quite different.
UNITEs strategy has tackled this effectively and as a result the Group is well placed, both operationally and financially, to prosper: 146m It is on track to deliver its secured development pipeline of 2,800 beds in London over the next couple of years, which will be significantly accretive to both USAF portfolio acquired earnings and NAV: fromUnite in nov 2010 It has the capital, expertise and reputation to add to this pipeline further in 2011 with additional enhancements to earnings and NAV expected as a result: It has a well positioned portfolio focused on the strongest student locations that will deliver good sustainable annual rental growth over 3% expected for 2011 12.
Student demand for UNITEs product remains strong and capital constraints will limit the level of new competing supply: The portfolio offers attractive asset management upside through a combination of extension, refurbishment and reversion opportunities that can be realised in the medium term: The Groups brand, reputation and operational and financial position may offer other potential growth opportunities as the sector matures in the coming years.
Taking into account its strategy, its people and its track record the Group looks forward to the future with confidence.
