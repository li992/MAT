Statutory Information 9 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies that have been consistently applied in arriving at the financial information set out in this report are: Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for certain items which have been measured at fair value, namely financial instruments.
The financial statements are presented in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Companys result for the year is shown in note 13.
Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of intangible and tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Intangible fixed assets 58 years straight line Leasehold improvements The lower of ten years or the lease term straight line Computer equipment 45 years straight line Fixtures & fittings 20% reducing balance Motor vehicles 20% reducing balance Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The currency translation differences on retranslation of the foreign branches at the balance sheet date are recognised directly in equity.
Financial instruments The Company uses forward foreign currency contracts and options to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates.
The Company also uses interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures.
Such instruments are stated at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and loss account in the period.
The Groups consolidated financial statements contain financial instrument disclosures which comply with FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 not to present separate financial instrument disclosures for the Company.
Leases Assets acquired under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and the outstanding future obligations are shown in creditors.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Operating lease income is credited to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives received from landlord In accordance with UITF 28, the aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a credit to the profit and loss account.
The benefits of the incentives are allocated over the life of the lease on a straight line basis.
Pension cost The Company contributes to a group personal pension scheme for qualifying employees whereby it makes defined contributions to independently administered personal pension schemes.
The company does not control any of the assets or have any ongoing liabilities with regard to the performance of and payments from these individual personal schemes.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 109 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued Research and development Research and development costs are written off as incurred in the year of expenditure.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be measured reliably.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Rendering of services Revenue on service contracts is recognised only when their outcomes can be foreseen with reasonable certainty and is based on the percentage stage of completion of the contracts, calculated on the basis of costs incurred.
Accrued and deferred revenue arising on long-term contracts is included in debtors as accrued income and creditors as deferred income as appropriate.
Support and maintenance contracts are invoiced in advance and normally run for periods of 12 months with automatic renewal on the anniversary date.
Revenue in respect of support and maintenance contracts is recognised evenly over the 12 months commencing from the date of the contract period.
Managed services hosting fees are recognised over the term of the hosting contract on a straight-line basis.
Professional services and consulting revenue, which is provided on a time and expense basis, is recognised as the service is performed.
For multiple element arrangements revenue is allocated to each element on fair value regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract.
The portion of the revenue allocated to an element is recognised when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on despatch of the goods.
Revenue on software licenses and upgrades is recognised on despatch, when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining and the collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable.
In circumstances where a considerable future vendor obligation exists as part of a software licence and related services contract, revenue is recognised over the period that the obligation exists per the contract.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred arising from timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for tax on gains arising from fair value adjustments of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
110 Statutory Information 9 National Insurance Contributions on Share Option Gains Following the issuance of UITF abstract 25 National Insurance contributions on Share Option Gains the Company makes provision for the National Insurance contributions on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options and as remeasured each period thereafter until the options are exercised.
The remeasurement is based upon the share price at the year-end.
Cash flow statement The Company has taken advantage of the exemption granted by Financial Reporting Standard 1 to not present a cash flow statement.
Related party transactions The Company has taken advantage of the exemption granted by Financial Reporting Standard 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the SDL plc group.
Investments Investments are recorded at cost.
Investments denominated in foreign currency are recorded using the rate of exchange at the date of acquisition and reviewed annually for evidence of impairment.
Financial Assets Investments Investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Investments in unquoted equity investments which do not have a reliable market value are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
For investments where there is an actively traded market the investment is stated at fair value, determined by reference to a quoted market bid price at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Cash Cash in bank represents cash in hand and deposits repayable with any qualifying institution.
Debtors Debtors are recorded at initial measurement and are provided for where management consider an element of the balance to be irrecoverable.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts which give rise to them and are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss or loans and payables as appropriate.
When financial liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
A financial liability is generally fide-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fiderecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss constitute financial guarantee contracts.
The fair value is calculated based on an assessment of both the likelihood that the financial guarantee would be called upon and expected cash flows which could arise.
Liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at fair value and re-evaluated at each financial year end, with gains or losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 111 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management believe it to be probable that the Company will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to net present value where this is deemed to be material.
Bank borrowings Interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective rate of interest method.
Share based payments Employees including directors of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by using an appropriate option pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
In accordance with UITF 25, National Insurance on Share Option Grants, the anticipated National Insurance charge on gains made by employees over the period from date of grant of the option to the end of the performance period has been provided for.
Group and Treasury share transactions Where a parent entity grants rights to its equity instruments to its employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, FRS 20 requires the subsidiary to record an expense for such compensation, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, in the financial statements of the Company, the Company recognises an increase in fixed asset investments or amounts owed by group companies for the aggregate amount of these contributions, with a credit to equity for the same amount.
