Scottish and Southern Energy 94 Annual Report 2010 Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 1.
SiGNifiCANT ACCOuNTiNG POLiCiES continued iii Impairment testing The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that the value of those assets is impaired.
In assessing for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash flows are allocated to an appropriate cash generating unit CGU.
The recoverable amount of the assets, or the appropriate CGU, is measured as the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use calculations requires the estimation of future cash flows to be derived from the respective CGUs and to select and an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate their present value.
The fair values less costs to sell methodology used for the wind farms CGUs also requires the discounting of cash flows from the projects within the respective CGUs.
The estimation of the timing and value of underlying projected cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates involves management judgement.
Subsequent changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the assets within the respective CGUs.
iv Provisions and contingencies The assessments undertaken in recognising provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with IAS 37.
The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events has required best judgement by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss.
Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.
v Financial Instruments fair values The valuation of the financial instruments is based upon published price quotations in active markets and valuation techniques where such information is not available.
Energy commodity contracts are classified as either derivative contracts under IAS 39 or as contracts for the Groups own use requirements.
Only IAS 39 derivatives are accounted for on a fair value basis.
More detail on this is included in note 28. vi Exceptionals and remeasurements The criteria for identifying what constitutes an exceptional item are outlined in note 1 Exceptional items and certain remeasurements.
SEGMENTAL iNfORMATiON The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments in the financial statements.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance.
In the Groups case the chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required an entity to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and rewards approach.
Following the adoption of IFRS 8 the Groups reportable segments have not changed.
The Groups operating segments are therefore those used internally by the Board to run the business and make strategic decisions.
The operating segments are also the Groups reportable segments.
The Groups operating segments are the distribution and transmission of electricity in the North of Scotland, the distribution of electricity in the South of England together referred to as Power Systems, the generation and supply of electricity and sale of gas in Great Britain and Ireland Generation and Supply and other businesses.
In addition to this the Groups 50% equity share in Scotia Gas Networks plc, a business which distributes gas in Scotland and the South of England refer to note 13, is included as a separate segment where appropriate due to its significance.
The types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are: Segment Geographical location Description Power Systems UK Transmits and distributes electricity to over 3 million businesses, offices and homes.
