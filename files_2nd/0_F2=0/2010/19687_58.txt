The effective tax rate for the Group including joint ventures and associates is a credit of 0.5% 2009: 15.4%.
The Finance No 2 Act 2010 was enacted on 21st July 2010 which reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 27% from 1st April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1st April 2014.
This has not been enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, is not included in these financial statements.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 24% by 1st April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
If the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 2014, the effect of the changes from 27% to 24% would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability by 0.1m.
