21 Recoverable VAT In 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that investment management fees should be exempt from VAT.
Since then, HMRC has accepted the Managers repayment claims for the periods from 1990 to 1996 and from 2000 to 2007.
During the year ended 30 April 2009 the Company received a reimbursement of 2,902,000 in this regard of which 1,164,000 had been recognised in the year to 30 April 2008, with the balance of 1,738,000 being recognised in that year together with interest thereon of 1,078,000.
A case has been recently brought against HMRC to seek to recover the amounts relating to the intervening period, 1997 to 2000, together with interest on a compound basis.
The Companys Auditors, PwC, have provided services in connection with this case for a fee of 35,000 see note 4.
Additional fees may become payable to PwC in the event of a successful outcome to the case.
No amounts have been accrued in this regard.
The potential recoveries of VAT and interest would be a significant multiple to the potential additional fees payable to PwC.
No VAT or related interest recovery has been accrued or recognised as a contingent asset as the outcome of the case is expected to remain uncertain for several years.
22 Related Party Transactions The Directors fees for the year are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 26.
No Director has a contract of service with the Company.
During the year no Director was interested in any contract or other matter requiring disclosure under section 412 of the Companies Act 2006.
The details of the management fee are set out in note 3, and the management fee due to Baillie Gifford as at 30 April 2010 is disclosed in note 11.
23 Financial Instruments As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to secure its investment objective of capital growth.
The Company borrows money when the Board and Managers have sufficient conviction that the assets funded by borrowed monies will generate a return in excess of the cost of borrowing.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that cause short term variation in the Companys net assets and could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent reduction in the Companys net assets rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Manager both assesses the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitors the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9.
Details of derivative financial instruments outstanding at the balance sheet date are shown on page 44.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
40 ANNUAL REPORT 2010 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk continued The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Manager assesses the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the currency in which a companys share price is quoted is not necessarily the one in which it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on overseas earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the share price of the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts are used periodically to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Where appropriate, they are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objectives.
The main change to net currency exposure during the year has been a reduction in the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen exposures relative to other overseas currencies, mainly due to the relative increase in the Companys Asia Pacific and Emerging Markets assets.
Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Currency Risk Sensitivity At 30 April 2010, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2009.

Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments other than its fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the fair value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value assuming that the Companys share price is unaffected by movements in interest rates.
During the year the Company drew down a 40 million short term variable rate bank loan and entered into a 30 year interest rate swap for 40m see note 11 and the table on page 44 for further details.
The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 April is shown below.

Includes a convertible security which has been classified as an equity holding.
This instrument comprises a zero coupon note issued by Credit Suisse and an option on sterling interest rate swaps.
The zero coupon element has a redemption value of 6.25 million fair value 3.7 million and the redemption value of the interest rate swap element fair value 13.1 million is based on a formula linked to thirty year sterling interest swap rates with higher amounts payable as rates rise.
Prior to redemption, the value of the interest rate swap element will vary depending on several factors such as the level of swap rates and the implied volatility of interest rate swap options.

A decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 12,252,000 2009 2,145,000 and would have decreased net asset value per share with debentures at fair value by 6.4p 2009 2.6p.
Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objective and investment policy.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity A full list of the Companys investments is shown on pages 12 to 16.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest equity investments are contained in the Managers Portfolio Review section.
101.8% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities 2009 74.4%.
A 5% increase in quoted equity valuations at 30 April 2010 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 48,801,000 2009 25,314,000.
A decrease of 5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Board also sets parameters for the degree to which the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
The Companys current borrowing facilities are detailed in notes 11 and 12 and the maturity profile of its borrowings is set out above.
Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: the Companys listed investments are held on its behalf by Bank of New York Mellon, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily done on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: the credit worthiness of the counterparty to transactions involving derivatives, structured notes and other arrangements, wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Manager: and cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Managers as reputable and of high credit quality.
