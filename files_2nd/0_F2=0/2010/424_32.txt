Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 1. gEnERal infORmaTiOn Afren plc the Company or the Group is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
Thenature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Chairman and Chief Executives Statement and Review of Operations onpages14and 26 These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2. adoption of new and revised standards In the current financial year, the Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business combinations revised 2008 and International Accounting Standard 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised 2008.
The most significant changes to the Groups previous accounting policies for business combinations are as follows: acquisition related costs which previously would have been included in the cost of a business combination are included in administrative expenses as they are incurred: any pre-existing equity interest in the entity acquired is re-measured to fair value at the date of obtaining control, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in profit or loss: any changes in the Groups ownership interest subsequent to the date of obtaining control are recognised directly in equity with no adjustment to goodwill: and any changes to the cost of an acquisition, including contingent consideration, resulting from events after the date of acquisition are recognised in profit or loss.
Previously, such changes would have resulted in an adjustment to goodwill.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards, amendments and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were inissue but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IAS 24 amended Related Party Disclosures IAS 32 amended Classification of Rights Issues IFRIC 14 amended Prepayment of a Minimum Funding Requirement IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments Improvements to IFRSs May 2010 The adoption of IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments.
No decision will be made by the Group on early adoption until all phases of the standard are complete.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial position of the Group.
2. accOunTing POliciEs Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared inaccordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and oil inventory which is subject tocertain commodity swap arrangements that have been measured at fair value.
going concern The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting.
The use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration theGroups current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the Going Concern section of the Directors Report.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to the 31December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operational policies of an entity so as to gain benefit from its activities.
Entities over which the Company exercises joint control are accounted for using proportional consolidation, under which the Group records its share of revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
As a consolidated Group income statement is published, a separate profit and loss account for the Parent Company has not been published in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
90 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial Statements Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate ifthat interest were disposed of.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively: liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquirees share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed asof the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Management generally assigns fair values to intangible exploration and evaluation assets to equal the excess of the purchase price consideration over and above the other assets and liabilities acquired, when this represents the most reliable indication of fair value.
As a consequence, no goodwill arises.
Property, plant and equipment other Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the tangible fixed assets, less anticipated disposal proceeds, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life as follows: Leasehold improvements over life of lease Fixtures and equipment over three years Computer hardware and software over three years Gas plant over six and a quarter years Oil and gas assets and intangible exploration and evaluation assets The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for intangible exploration and evaluation E&E costs.
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible fixed assets in cost centres by field or exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination of commerciality of the relevant property.
Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration activities.
Pre-licence costs and general exploration costs not specific to any particular licence or prospect are expensed as incurred.
If prospects are deemed to be impaired unsuccessful on completion of the evaluation, the associated costs are charged to the income statement.
If the field is determined to be commercially viable, the attributable costs are transferred to property, plant and equipment in single field cost centres.
These costs are then depreciated on a unit of production basis.
All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment related to production activities are amortised inaccordance with the Groups depletion and amortisation accounting policy.
Afren plc 91 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 continued 2. accOunTing POliciEs continued Revenues Revenue represents the sales value, net of VAT and royalties paid in kind or where the financial obligation does not fall directly to Afren, of the Groups share of oil liftings in the year together with gas and tariff income and interest income.
Oil and gas revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
commercial reserves Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible.
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as a proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
depletion and amortisation oil and gas assets All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus the production in the period, generally on a field-by-field basis.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs.
Changes inthe estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicates a possible impairment in a discovery field, the recoverability of the net book value relating to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future cash flows based on managements expectations of future oil and gas prices and futurecosts.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since theimpairment.
decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed.
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment.
The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value, and is reassessed each year in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the provision and acorresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included as a finance cost.
impairment Non-current assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount.
Such triggering events are defined in IFRS 6 in respect of E&E assets and include the point at which determination is made as to whether commercial reserves exist.
Where there has been an indication of a possible impairment, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by comparison with the estimated discounted future net cash flows based on managements expectation of future production, oil prices and costs.
Any identified impairment is charged totheincome statement.
investment in subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries held by the Company as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in US dollars which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising are included in the profit and loss for the period.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of each Group company are translated into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences if any arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation isdisposed of.
At present the Group has no subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars.
92 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial Statements Operating leases Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the relevant lease.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
share-based payments The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, Directors and other third parties.
Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant, measured by use of an appropriate valuation model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period to exercise, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company is liable for Employers National Insurance on the difference between the market value at date of exercise and exercise price.
This expense is accrued byreference to the share price of the Company at the balance sheet date.
Pensions Payments to a defined contribution pension scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
inventories Inventories spare parts are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
The cash flows associated with the purchase of spare parts areclassified in investment activities with the oil and gas assets.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, .
Inventories oil and butane inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value other than certain oil inventory in Cte dIvoire, which is settled via areduction in the amount recoverable in respect of realised gas sales from the Lion Gas Plant.
The inventory subject to this swap is recorded at its fair value.
finance costs and debt Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Financial costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Arrangement fees and issue costs are deducted from the debt proceeds on initial recognition of the liability and are amortised and charged to the income statement as finance costs over the term of thedebt.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments The Group has entered into swaps and call options to economically protect against exposures to variability in the price of a proportion of Okoro and Cte dIvoire crude oil production for 2008 to 2012.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The gains and losses arising out of changes in fair value of these derivative financial instruments together with settlements in the period are accounted for in other operating income expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Afren plc 93 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2010 continued 2. accOunTing POliciEs continued Available for sale investments Available for sale investments are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available for sale investments are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the profit or loss for the period.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at their fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount ofcash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
Investments inassociates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, insubstance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations to make or has made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
Any excess of the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition above the cost of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited inprofit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Lossesmay provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Convertible bonds and loan notes Convertible bonds and loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds or loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
Theportion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component ofthe instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the non-current asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year of the classification.
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
94 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial Statements 3. cRiTical accOunTing judgEmEnTs and kEy sOuRcEs Of EsTimaTiOn uncERTainTy In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate isrevised if the revision affects only that period, orin the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements, key assumptions and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Oil and gas assets Management is required to assess the oil and gas assets for indicators of impairment.
Note 13 discloses the carrying value of tangible oil and gas assets.
As part of this assessment, management has carried out an impairment test ceiling test on the tangible oil and gas assets Okoro Setu, Ebok and Cte dIvoire assets.
This test compares the carrying value of the assets at the balance sheet date with the expected discounted cash flows from each project.
For the discounted cash flows to be calculated, management has used a production profile based on its best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an internal oil price profile benchmarked to mean analysts consensus and a 10% discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
intangible exploration and evaluation assets Management is required to assess impairment in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
Note 12 discloses the carrying value of such assets.
The triggering events are defined in IFRS 6.
In making the assessment, management is required to make judgements on the status of each project and the future plans towards finding commercial reserves.
The nature of exploration and evaluation activity is such that only a proportion of projects are ultimately successful and some assets are likely to become impaired in future periods.
share-based payments Management is required to make assumptions in respect of the inputs used to calculate the fair values of share-based payment arrangements.
Details of these can befound in note 30. fair value of Black marlin acquisition The assets and liabilities acquired following the completion of Black Marlin Energy Holdings Limited acquisition by the Company have been recorded at fair value atthe completion date, as outlined further in note 31.
The estimates ofsuch fair values required significant judgement to be applied, particularly in respect of intangible exploration and evaluationassets.
The amounts are provisional, and may be revised within 12 months of the acquisition.
decommissioning The Group has decommissioning obligations in Nigeria and Cte dIvoire.
The extent to which a provision is required depends on the legal requirements at the date ofdecommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate to be applied.
The decommissioning provision will be updated each year to reflect Managements best estimates.
Taxation The application of tax legislation in jurisdictions in which the Group operates can be uncertain and subject to interpretation.
As disclosed in note 28, the Group has significant tax liabilities which may be subject to revision as the Groups tax filings are agreed with the relevant authorities in future periods.
financial risk management In respect of financial risk management, at the balance sheet date, the Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables andanyderivative asset.
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring that sufficient funds are available to meet its commitments as they fall due.
The Group uses projected cash flows tomonitor funding requirements for the Groups activities.
Additional details in respect of the Groups financing facilities are in note 21.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates is mitigated by regular reviews of available fixed and variable rate debts and taking the most favourable for the Groups needs.
The interest on borrowings from BNP Paribas, Sojitz and FCMB is based on LIBOR plus a margin and therefore the interest charged isaffected by movement in LIBOR.
credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the credit risk of the entities that it sells its products to or that it enters into contractual arrangements with and will obtain guarantees and commercial letters of credit as may beconsidered necessary where risks are significant to the Group.
The Groups business is diversified in terms of both region and the number of counterparties and, other than transactions with major oil companies with high credit rating and government organisations in Cte dIvoire, the Group does not have significant exposure to any single counterparty or group of counterparties with similar characteristics.
The credit risk on cash is limited because the majority is deposited with banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies or with governmental guarantee.
The Groups total maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2010 wasUS$171.3 million 2009: US$ 369.6 million made up of cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables excluding prepayments.

During the first half of 2009 an additional derivative contract in respect of the Okoro crude was entered into for the period 2009 to 2011.
The Group will receive a minimum amount if the market falls, but will receive a set discount from the market price if the oil price is above that minimum.
The arrangement protects the Group against the risk of a significant fall in the price of crude oil by establishing a minimum price for the Okoro crude.
During2008 on acquisition of CI-11 field in Cte dlvoire, the Group entered into similar instruments to protect against variability in price of the CI-11 crudeoil production for the period from 2008 to 2012.
The loss of US$8.9 million 2009: US$33.6 million loss arising during the year as a result of the changes infairvalue ofthese derivative financial instruments has been accounted for in the income statement net of cash realisations, as the criteria for hedge accounting were not met.
In addition to the above commodity derivatives, the change in July 2008 of the functional currency of the holding company from pounds sterling to US dollar resulted incertain sterling denominated warrants being accounted for as derivatives from that date, as they are no longer convertible at a fixed price in that companys functional currency.
The fair value of the warrants at 31 December 2010, recorded within other creditors, wasUS$11.2 million 2009: US$5.5 million and the resultant loss during the year of US$8.1 million 2009: US$5.0 million loss has been taken to the incomestatement.

BORROwings and OThER financial insTRumEnTs continued Sensitivity analysis interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups bank borrowings.
The Group has managed the interest rate risk by using a mix of fixed and variable rates on convertible bonds, loan notes and bank borrowings respectively.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to changes in LIBOR rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax.

Sojitz invested US$45 million in the form of loan notes in Afren which become convertible bonds at the time of entering into or announcing joint acquisitions.
The loan notes bear a coupon based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2%.
The net proceeds from the issue of the loan notes were split between aliability component and an equity component at the date of issue.
The liability component of the loan notes was US$41.4 million as at 31 December 2010 2009: US$37.2million.
The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 8.7% 2009: 10.3% to the liability component.
The loan notes were originally repayable infullin October 2011, although subsequent to the balance sheet date, an agreement was reached and the full outstanding balance of US$45 million on the notes was repaid inFebruary 2011.

The Groups policy is to award options to employees on appointment or completion of their probationary period and periodically thereafter.
Options are issued at market price on the grant date and have vesting periods of up to three years.
The options expire after 10 years if they remain unexercised and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest except at the discretion of the Board.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2009 was 108p.
In 2010 options were granted on 19, 26 and 29 January, 29 March, 23 April, 18 June, 1 September, 22 October, and 2 November.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was $2.4 million.
In 2009 options were granted on 23 January, 7 April, 1 July, 26 September, 26, 30 and 31 December.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was $12.4 million.
The options granted during the year have been valued by reference to the Barrier option valuation model, consistent with the prior year.
The inputs into the Barrier model were as follows: 2010 2009 Weighted average share price pence 112.7 64.2 Weighted average exercise price pence 112.3 112.2 Weighted average target price before eligibility to exercise barrier pence 157.2 91.7 Expected volatility 40% 50% Expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 4.0% 4.0% Expected dividends The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data.
The volatility was measured utilising several formulae, including an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model and a GARCH Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity model, and over several time periods.
These gave a range of estimates for the share price volatility with a reduction from the previous year.
Therefore the volatility assumption was reduced, but will remain under review going forwards.
The Company and Group recognised total expenses related to equity settled share based payment transactions in the form of options in 2010 of US$3,681,000 and US$5,119,000 respectively, of which US$5,054,000 related to employees, including executive directors, of the Group 2009: US$1,298,000 and US$1,742,000 respectively, of which US$1,625,000 related to employees, including executive directors, of the Group.

The Afren Performance Share Plan awards a number of shares to Directors and staff based on a multiple of salary.
However, these shares only vest after a three-year period and the full award is made only if Afren has performed in the top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oil and gas companies: Borders & Southern Petroleum plc, Bowleven, Cairn Energy, Desire Petroleum, Enquest, Falkland Oil & Gas, Gulf Keystone Petroleum, Gulfsands Petroleum, Hardy Oil & Gas, Heritage Oil, Ithaca Energy, JKX Oil & Gas, Melrose Resources, Petroceltic International, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration, Salamander Energy, Serica Energy, SocoInternational, Sterling Energy, Tullow Oil and Valiant Petroleum.
If Afren does not achieve at least median performance in the peer group, no shares will be awarded.
At the median level, 30% of the shares will vest and there is a sliding scale between median and top quartile performance where only a percentage of the total award will vest.
Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest, except under certain circumstances e. g. redundancies, where the number of awards vesting will be prorated according to the length of time the employee has been employed during the three-year vesting period.

The aggregate of the fair value of the options granted during the year ended 31 December 2010 was US$5.2 million year ended 31 December 2009: US$4.4 million.
The fair values were calculated using a stochastic model.
The inputs used for fair valuing awards granted during the two periods were as follows: 2010 2009 Weighted average share price pence 129.0 45.5 Weighted average exercise price pence 1.0 1.0 Expected volatility 40% 50% Expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 2.2% Expected dividends 0.0% 0.0% The volatility of Afren shares was calculated by looking at the available historic movements in Afrens return index as defined by Datastream an index which tracks share price plus reinvested dividends on the ex-dividend date over the period commensurate with the proportion of the performance period that had not elapsed by the date of grant.
The results were adjusted to take out anomolous period of extreme volatilty which are not expected to be typical for future periods.
The resulting estimate was slightly lower than prior periods.
The Company and Group recognised total expenses related to the above equity settled share based payment transactions in the form of options in during the year ended 31 December 2010 of US$2,604,000 and US$3,832,000 respectively 2009: US$1,626,000 and US$2,281,000 respectively.

The aggregate of the fair value of the options granted during 2008 was $11 million.
As the exercise price for these awards is nominal and there are no market based vesting criteria, the awards granted were valued using the share prices on dates of grant which was 137p on a weighted average basis.
The Company and Group recognised total expenses related to equity settled share based payment transactions in relation to the above awards in the year ended 31 December 2010 of US$351,000 and US$408,000 respectively year ended 31 December 2009 US$861,000 and US$2,404,000 respectively.

Under this scheme the Founders of Afren undertook to invest a total of US$5.0million equivalent in Afren shares prior to 30 September 2008 and were granted a total of 40 million warrants.
The agreements were finalised and warrants granted in January 2009.
The warrants had an exercise price of 1.60 per share but were only exercisable if the share price reached 2.50 for at least 30 days anincrease of 56% above the exercise price.
The warrants expired in December 2009.
The warrants were also subject to certain anti-dilution clauses which meant that they were re-priced following the private placement in May 2009 to 0.38 being the lower of the share price over the five days prior to the issue of the shares orthe issue price of the new shares plus 20%.
