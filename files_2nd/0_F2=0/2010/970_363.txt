148 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 FinAnciAl stAtements: Notes to the financial statements continued 25. financial Risk management and deRivative financial assets liabilities continued Given the diverse nature of the Groups operations both in relation to commodity markets and geographically, together with insurance cover including letters of credit from financial institutions, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an identified loss event, which based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Details of the credit quality of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is disclosed in note 21.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities including refinancing, where necessary in order to meet short term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any group distribution restrictions that exist.
In addition, certain projects are financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities including associated derivatives, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date are as follows: Within one year One to two years Fixed Floating Capital Fixed Floating Capital US$ million interest interest repayment interest interest repayment 2010 1 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 566 148 6,356 566 126 1,155 2 Net settled derivatives 485 303 13 486 306 3 81 451 6,343 80 432 1,152 2009 1 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 550 200 5,660 523 185 3,226 2 Net settled derivatives 461 267 441 273 5 89 467 5,660 82 458 3,221 Two to five years Greater than five years Fixed Floating Capital Fixed Floating Capital US$ million interest interest repayment interest interest repayment 2010 3 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,197 137 7,504 530 1,400 3,241 2 Net settled derivatives 1,083 619 337 530 282 291 114 756 7,841 1,682 3,532 2009 3 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,379 295 5,877 672 608 4,394 2 Net settled derivatives 1,187 712 32 672 331 339 192 1,007 5,909 939 4,733 1 Includes guarantees and loan facilities.

At 31 December 2010 $1.1 billion 2009: nil was drawn under the facility which was subsequently repaid.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that financial instrument fair values will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
The significant market risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
Foreign exchange risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenues.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures as hedging is not deemed appropriate given the diversified nature of the Group, though exceptions can be approved by the Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar expenditure on approved capital projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities.
The Groups policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.

2 Of these US dollar financial assets, $413 million 2009: $127 million are subject to South African exchange controls and will be converted to rand within six months of 31 December.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of short term investments and financing activities.
Exposure to interest rate risk is particularly with reference to changes in US and South African interest rates.
The Group policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest as, over the longer term, this is considered by management to give somewhat of a natural hedge against commodity price movements, given the correlation with economic growth and industrial activity which in turn shows a high correlation with commodity price fluctuation.
In certain circumstances, the Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of its existing debt.
Strategic hedging using fixed rate debt may also be undertaken from time to time if approved by the Group Management Committee.
In respect of financial assets, the Groups policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and cash reserves are to be maintained in short term investments less than one year in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets excluding intra-group loan balances to interest rate risk is as follows: 2010 2009 interest bearing non-interest Interest bearing Non-interest financial assets bearing financial assets financial assets bearing financial assets Other Other nonnonFloating Fixed equity interest Floating Fixed Equity interest 1 1 US$ million rate rate investments bearing total rate rate investments bearing Total 2 Financial assets excluding derivatives 6,981 1,068 1,300 4,155 13,504 3,530 1,032 1,131 3,652 9,345 Derivative assets 315 527 842 174 429 603 Financial asset exposure to interest rate risk 7,296 1,068 1,300 4,682 14,346 3,704 1,032 1,131 4,081 9,948 1 Includes $643 million 2009: $546 million of preference shares in BEE entities.
2 At 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 no interest rate swaps were held in respect of financial asset exposures.
Floating rate financial assets consist mainly of cash and bank term deposits.
Interest on floating rate financial assets is based on the relevant national inter-bank rates.
Fixed rate financial assets consist mainly of financial asset investments and cash, and have a weighted average interest rate of 11.7% 2009: 11.0% for an average period of three years 2009: three years.
Equity investments have no maturity period and the majority are fully liquid.
