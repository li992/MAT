During the year the acquisition of Greater Manchester Waste Limited resulted in the Group participating in two further defined benefit pension schemes.
The amounts acquired are shown in the analysis of the fair value of the schemes assets and the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligations below.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustees of the funds are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of schemes trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy for the main fund that one-half of all trustees, other than the Chairman, are nominated by members of the schemes, including pensioners.

Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long-term rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
In conjunction with its investment advisers, the trustees have structured the schemes investments with the objective of balancing investment returns and levels of risk.
The asset allocation for the main scheme has three principal elements: holding of bonds which is expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and reflects the schemes liabilities a proportion of equities, with fund managers having freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns investment of a relatively small proportion of the schemes assets circa 10% in alternative asset classes which give the potential for gaining higher returns property and currency.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
