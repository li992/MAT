Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profi t for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suffi cient taxable profi ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Employee share schemes The Group operates a number of equity settled compensation schemes for its employees.
For schemes commencing 1 January 2004 and after, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares granted as determined at the grant date excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market conditions such as profi tability targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptionsover the number of free shares to vest under the applicable scheme.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares to be granted with the impact of any change in the assumptions recognised through income.
