Financial risk management In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain financial risks, principally foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks are managed by the central treasury function in conjunction with the operating units, in accordance with risk management policies that are designed to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on financial performance.
The policies are reviewed and approved by the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations around the world and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.
Where cost effective, the exposures arising from the translation of the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
Some Group operations also enter into commercial transactions in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Exposures arising from the translation of foreign currency transactions are continually monitored and material exposures are managed through the use of forward contracts or options once cash flows can be identified with sufficient certainty.
Exposures arising from the translation of intra-group lending are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
The following table shows the impact due to the retranslation of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities in the Group's operations of a, reasonably possible, 10% movement in the Groups principal foreign currency exchange rates at the year end date.

The effect on shareholders equity is due to the effect on profit as well as interest rate and currency swaps and the hedge of net investments in foreign currencies.
Further details of the currency profile of borrowings are given in note 22.
