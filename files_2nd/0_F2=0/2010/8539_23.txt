ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 58 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts For the year ended 30 September 2010 General information ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 94.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Divisional summary on pages 18 to 25 and in note 1.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
Impact of new accounting standards IFRS 8, Operating Segments IFRS 8 sets out disclosure requirements concerning an entitys reportable segments, products, services, geographical areas in which it operates and its major customers.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, Segmental Reporting.
The Group has not been significantly impacted by the adoption of this standard, see note 1 for further details.
Amendment to IFRS 3, Business Combinations revised 2008 and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised 2008 The most significant changes to the Groups previous accounting policies for business combinations are as follows: r Acquisition related costs which previously would have been included in the cost of a business combination are included in administrative expenses as they are incurred: r Any pre-existing equity interest in the entity acquired is remeasured to the fair value at the date of obtaining control, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in income statement: r Any changes in the Groups ownership interest subsequent to the date of obtaining control are recognised directly in equity, with no adjustment to goodwill: and r Any changes to the cost of an acquisition, including contingent consideration, resulting from events after the date of acquisition are recognised in income statement.
Previously, such changes resulted in an adjustment to goodwill.
The revised standards have been applied to the acquisitions set out in note 10.
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 1 October 2009 which result in an adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS 3 2004 and IAS 27 2005.
860,000 of transaction costs relating to completed and pending acquisitions made in the period have been expensed that would previously have been capitalised on the balance sheet see note 4.
Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements This amendment introduces changes to the way in which movements in equity must be disclosed and requires an entity to disclose each component of other comprehensive income not recognised in profit and loss.
The amendment also requires disclosure of the amount of income and deferred tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income as well as other minor disclosure amendments.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year ended 30 September 2010, and these have been adopted but have had no impact on the 2010 Group financial statements: r IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-Cash Assets to Owners r IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets to Customers The following interpretations have been issued which are not applicable to the Group since they are only effective for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2010.
These are also not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements: r IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement r IFRIC 19 Extinguishing liabilities with equity instruments Basis of accounting ITE Group plc is a UK-listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as the Group.
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
In addition, the Group has complied with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses.
These estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Changes to estimates and assumptions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made.
Operating performance Overview and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 59 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in the Directors report on page 36.
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company drawn up to 30 September each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the non-controlling interests proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the non-controlling interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Noncontrolling interests consist of the amount of those interests as at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interests share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of their interest in the subsidiaries equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: r deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively: r liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquirees share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: and r assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 60 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts continued For the year ended 30 September 2010 Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets.
Intangible assets Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost, acquired trademarks, brands and customer lists are measured at fair value.
Computer software, trademarks, brands and customer lists have a definite useful life and are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives are typically between three and seven years, with some trademarks having an estimated useful life of up to 20 years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Leasehold improvements term of lease Fixture and fittings ten years Plant and equipment four years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Operating performance Overview and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 61 Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited in profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances Where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off-setting against future venue hire or by cash repayment, the fair value is recognised based on the discounted value of future cash receipts.
The loan balance is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Financial instruments Classes of financial instruments The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics.
The details of financial instruments by class are disclosed in note 20 to the accounts.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and derivative assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, and is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence of impairment.
Financial assets are derecognised in full or partly when the Groups rights to cash flows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has neither exposure to the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 62 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts continued For the year ended 30 September 2010 Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
This category includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The estimates are based on specific credit circumstances and the Groups historical bad receivables experience.
No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short-term nature or specific arrangements in place, and hence the effective interest rate method is not applied.
Derivative assets A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date.
Derivative assets are classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
Financial liabilities The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: bank borrowings, trade and other payables held at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Written put options Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in a subsidiary for cash gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the repurchase price.
An amount equal to the liability is recorded in equity on initial recognition of a written put option.
The liability is subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Where bank overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Groups cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement.
Overdrafts that are considered to be financing in nature are presented as financing activities in the cash flow statement.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade payables are derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced by a new liability with substantially modified terms.
Trade and other payables are short-term and there is no interest charged in connection with these, hence the effective interest method is not applied.
Derivative liabilities A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date.
Derivative liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Group designates its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Operating performance Overview and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 63 At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values of cash flows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement, and is included in Finance income cost in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Groups use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups financial policies.
Further details on these policies can be found in the Divisional summary on pages 18 to 25.
Fair values The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely accepted valuation techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash flows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes for similar instruments and use of comparable arms length transactions.
Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event.
Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs relating to future events are deferred.
The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income and prepaid event costs respectively.
Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates and profit or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and before investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 64 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts continued For the year ended 30 September 2010 Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate where applicable.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in income for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in income for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Groups accounting policies for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transaction are used.
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero.
Consequently, any gain or loss on disposal will exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Employee Share Trust The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust ESOT.
Shares in the Company held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity.
The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Share-based payments The Group has applied IFRS 2 share-based payment.
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on managements best estimate.
Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Operating performance Overview and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 65 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by management and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected from the cash-generating unit to perpetuity and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The period used in the calculation is based on managements average expectation of the period over which the value will be derived from the cash-generating units.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2010 is 50.6 million and 28.8 million respectively.
Intangible assets The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cash flows arising from customer relationships and trademarks to determine the value of those intangible assets.
This involves estimating the period over which the customer relationships and trademarks affect future cash flows.
Share-based payments The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Groups share price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free rate of return, and expected option lives.
Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest: this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Taxation Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes.
Such issues can take several years to resolve.
The Group takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Groups results and future cash flows.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 66 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts continued For the year ended 30 September 2010 1 Segmental information IFRS 8 introduces the term Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Executive Board comprising the Executive Directors Russell Taylor Chief Executive Officer, Neil Jones Financial Director, Edward Strachan Executive Director, Stephen Keen, Alexander Shtalenkov, Colette Tebbutt and Suzanne King is considered to be the CODM.
ITEs reportable segments are strategic business units that are based in different geographic locations, predominantly in the developing and emerging markets.
Each business unit is managed separately and has a different marketing strategy as determined by the local management.
The products and services offered by each business unit are identical across the Group.
ITE Group evaluates performance on the basis of profit or loss from operations before tax expense not including non-recurring gains and losses and foreign exchange gains and losses.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 UK & Western Europe 14,850 10,873 Central Asia & Caucasus 7,437 7,400 Russia 23,231 23,298 Eastern & Southern Europe 3,794 3,048 Rest of the World 1,272 50,584 44,619 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash-generating units.
The growth rates are based on management forecasts.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based upon the most recent financial plans approved by the Board and extrapolates the planned cash flows.
Assumed growth rates based on GDP growth rates in the local markets and management judgements have been applied for the first three years beyond the detailed plans and a rate of 3% is applied thereafter.
These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for our business in the relevant markets.
Operating performance Overview and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 71 10 Goodwill acquired through business combinations continued The discount rates applied to the cash-generating units are between 10% and 14%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used.
Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.

The following is the analysis of deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2010 2009 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 6,089 4,134 Deferred tax assets 1,652 1,268 4,437 2,866 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1.9 million 2009: 1.5 million available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 4.5 million 2009: 3.7 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The put option is an open option with no fixed maturity date: it has been classified as a long-term financial liability.
Out of the total of 1.1 million of derivative financial assets, 0.9 million had a maturity of one year or less and 0.2 million has a maturity of one to three years.
Out of the total of 0.6 million of derivative financial liabilities, 0.5 million had a maturity of one to three years.
In 2009, all financial liabilities except derivative financial instruments have a maturity of one year or less.

The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis.
The Group does not enter into financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Fair value hierarchy The following table categories the Groups financial instruments which are held at fair value into 1 of 3 levels to reflect the degree to which observable inputs are used in determining their fair values: Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 000 000 000 000 Assets measured at fair value Foreign currency forward contracts 1,129 1,129 Total 1,129 1,129 Liabilities measured at fair value Foreign currency forward contracts 663 663 Put option 1,223 1,223 Total 1,886 663 1,223 Operating performance Overview and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 79 20 Financial instruments continued Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Financial risk management In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk including foreign currency and interest rate, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
This note presents Groups exposure to each of the above risks.
Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Divisional summary on pages 18 to 25.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has put in place policies that have been established to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward-plus or forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Financial assets 2010 2009 000 000 EUR 31,578 29,020 GBP 12,830 21,319 USD 6,044 3,092 Other 16,374 7,541 66,826 60,972 Financial liabilities 2010 2009 000 000 EUR 9,412 11,347 GBP 2,132 5,055 USD 3,258 3,288 Other 2,417 194 17,219 19,885 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below is based on a 10% appreciation depreciation of the Groups significant currencies against Sterling, applied to the net monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.

These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next 36 months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than six months or more than 36 months in the future.
At 30 September 2010, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net asset of approximately 0.5 million 2009: net liability of 0.6 million.
These amounts are based on market valuations.
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain currency trade receivable balances.
These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management.
All foreign exchange movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in the income statement.
Interest rate risk management As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowings at floating interest rates.
This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of floating interest rate borrowings.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.
Interest structure of financial liabilities 2010 2009 000 000 Financial liabilities at variable rates: Bank overdraft 10,183 9,480 The following average interest rates applied during the year and in the prior year: Bank overdraft 2010 2009 % % EUR 2.0 2.7 USD 2.6 1.2 Average interest rate applicable to cash balances were 1.6% in 2010 and 2.7% in 2009.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.
With all other variables held constant the table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1% change in interest rates applied to the major currencies of net variable rate asset liabilities.
1% is the sensitivity rate that represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments.
These represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups objective is to ensure all customers have paid before any service is provided to them.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing profile of the Groups trade receivables and the details of the Groups allowances for doubtful receivables can be seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held.
The territories in which ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies such as Moodys and Fitch.
The Group aims to minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash held in such banks.
The Groups exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.
Credit rating of financial assets excluding loans and receivables and derivative assets 2010 2009 000 000 Investments grade A and above 25,400 25,461 Investments grade B and above 5,343 3,054 Investments grade C or below or not rated 2,420 4,072 33,163 32,587 The source of the credit ratings is Moodys and Fitch.
The Group raise invoices on events using stage payments.
Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed and chased.
Management also review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when the service is provided.
Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by management to manage outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience, specific credit issues and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including default risk of the industry and country, in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full.
The allowance is recognised and measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, where material discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The main component of this allowance is a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposure on shows which have taken place but the debt has not been collected in full.
This allowance is determined by reference to the specific circumstances of each show and past experience.

Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors.
They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities as appropriate.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft, which is disclosed in note 15 and note 16 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 21 and in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
