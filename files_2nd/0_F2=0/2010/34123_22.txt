Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy continued 4.
2 Nature of interests and performance conditions continued Where appropriate the Committee may claw-back any awards that have already provisionally vested if subsequent performance during the three year period is below the targets.
Interests under the Plan will not vest until the end of the three year performance period and nothing will be paid out within this three year period other than in exceptional circumstances eg a good leaver.
The Committee feels the flexibility in the Plan will allow it to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
It will also ensure that any gain made by the Executive Directors is commensurate with their performance over the period and the financial and other performance of the Company.
The Plan should avoid the disadvantage inherent in many longer term incentive arrangements, namely being constrained by performance measures set at the outset which subsequently can prove to be out of step with the objectives of the business.
3 Vesting If the performance conditions are satisfied and the awards vest, shares will be transferred to the Executive Directors equal to the growth in value of the shares under award subject to the 2.00 cap on growth in value.
If there is insufficient value in these share interests to deliver the required payout, the Executive Directors will first be entitled to exercise an option to acquire further shares to make up the shortfall, and if this is still insufficient to deliver the required payout, a top-up cash payment will be made.
However, any cash payment cannot exceed 50% of the overall payment due to the Executive Directors.
The maximum payout in shares and cash to the Executive Directors as a whole at the end of the three year period will be up to a total of 3 million.
Based on current salary levels this represents a maximum potential reward for each Executive Director of circa 110% of salary for each performance year.
The awards that were approved at the Annual General Meeting in July 2009 were as follows: Number of shares in which Maximum value of Director Director has an interest award after three years James Gibson 500,000 1,000,000 Nicholas Vetch 500,000 1,000,000 Adrian Lee 250,000 500,000 John Trotman 250,000 500,000 As noted above any payout will be delivered in shares as far as possible.
Shares equal to 50% of the value of any payout after permitted sales to meet tax liabilities will be subject to further restrictions.
The Executive Directors will be required to hold half of these shares for a further year following vesting and the other half for a further two years.
During this holding period the Executive Directors will not be entitled to sell their shares.
This ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders remain aligned for up to five years.
The performance targets for the LTBPP are not disclosed for the year ahead, given the commercially sensitive nature of a number of the targets.
The Committee reports on their assessment of the key prior year targets, excluding any that are still commercially sensitive, and whether or not management has been able to meet these targets.
The report on these targets, which were not amended during the financial year, is summarised in the table below: Objective Committee Comment Raise new capital to fund continued growth in the business whilst This was achieved via an 9.9% placing in May 2009, raising maintaining gearing at the current levels.

As highlighted above, this award is subject to clawback, and may also be adjusted upwards, in future years.

GENERAL INFORMATION Big Yellow Group PLC is a Company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is 2 The Deans, Bridge Road, Bagshot, Surrey, GU19 5AT.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Business Review on pages 14 to 21.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the economic environment in which the Group operates.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards affecting the reported results and financial position Presentation IAS 1 revised requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
As a result, a consolidated statement of changes in equity has been included as a primary statement, showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented.
In addition, the revised standard requires the presentation of a third balance sheet, where certain changes in accounting policies are applied retrospectively.
Development properties Previously, development properties were accounted for under IAS 16, but are now accounted for under IAS 40.
The Groups date of adoption was 1 April 2009.
The impact of the adoption of IAS 40 revised was a the reclassification of property under construction into investment property previously held within development property, and b the reclassification of surplus land elements into surplus land current assets previously held within development property.
In accordance with IAS 40 the prior year comparatives have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting policy.
The Groups investment property under construction and surplus land accounting policies are included below.
In the past, where the Group had assets in the course of construction, these had been held at cost, and an assessment made of the anticipated surplus to be achieved on the opening and leasing up of a Big Yellow self storage facility within the branded portfolio.
If this supported the existing book cost, taking account of projected costs to complete, no provision was made against the cost.
The external valuation takes a different approach, and in effect is assuming a sale to a third party of an asset in the course of construction, assuming contingencies on construction costs, assessment of alternative use where planning risk remains and a level of developers profit.
An external valuation also has to consider market evidence, which is clearly limited in the current economic climate.
As a result, and given this is the first time this standard has been applied by the Group, a deficit has been booked of 13.3 million against the Group assets, and a 0.2 million deficit has been included as our share in Big Yellow Limited Partnership.
IFRS 7 The amendments to IFRS 7 expand the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk.
The Group has elected not to provide comparative information for this additional disclosure in the current year, in accordance with the transitional reliefs included in the amendments.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 IFRS 8 Operating segments: this did not affect the Groups disclosure as the requirements of the standard were already being met IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009 IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 October 2008 Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009 Amendments to IAS 39 permit an entity to reclassify non-derivative financial assets from fair value through profit or loss FVTPL and available for sale AFS categories in limited circumstances.
68 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2010 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and guidance relevant to the Group were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers, effective for transfers received on or after 1 July 2009 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010 Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 Various other amendments made as part of the IASBs 2009 Annual Improvements programme effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010.
These pronouncements, when applied, will either result in changes to presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for treatment of acquisition of subsidiaries and associates when IFRS 3 revised 2008, IAS 27 revised 2008 and IAS 28 revised 2008 come into effect for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the period commencing 1 April 2010.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Other than the adoption of IAS 40 Revised as described earlier, the principal accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements in the current and preceding year.
Certain comparative amounts in the cash flow statement have been classified to ensure comparability with the current year.
Going concern A review of the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out on pages 14 to 27 of the Business and Financial Review.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash flow statement and accompanying notes in the financial statements.
Further information concerning the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in the Business and Financial Review.
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion the Directors have had regard to the Groups operating plan and budget for the year ended 31 March 2011 and projections contained in the longer term business plan which covers the period to March 2016.
The Directors have considered carefully the Groups trading performance and cash flows as a result of the uncertain global economic environment, the ongoing shortage of credit available in the bank finance market in particular and the other principal risks to the Groups performance.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Big Yellow Group PLC and all of its subsidiaries at the year end using acquisition accounting principles.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
69 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2010 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Basis of consolidation continued Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Investment in subsidiaries These are recognised at cost less provision for any impairment.
Investment in associate An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale see below.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and any applicable value added tax.
Income is recognised over the period for which the storage room is occupied by the customer.
The Group recognises non-storage income over the period in which it is earned.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Management fees earned are recognised over the period for which the services are provided.
Franchise fees are recognised in the income statement as they fall contractually due to the Group.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred, unless the costs are incurred as part of the development of a qualifying asset, when they will be capitalised.
Commencement of capitalisation is the date when the Group incurs expenditure for the qualifying asset, incurs borrowing costs and undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably.
In the case of suspension of activities during extended periods, the Group suspends capitalisation.
The Group ceases capitalisation of borrowing costs when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Operating profit Operating profit is stated after gains and losses on non-current assets, movements on the revaluation of investment properties and before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Plant, equipment & owner occupied property All property, plant and equipment, not classified as investment or development property, are carried at historic cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Freehold improvements 20 years Leasehold improvements Over period of the lease Plant and machinery 10 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Computer equipment 3 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Investment property The criterion used to distinguish investment property from owner-occupied property is to consider whether the property is held for rental income and for capital appreciation.
Where this is the case, the Group recognises these owned or leased properties as investment properties.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
In accordance with IAS 40, investment property held leasehold is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Leasehold properties that are leased under operating leases are classified as investment properties and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the lessor for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception, and is shown within note 13a.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the outstanding lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
71 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2010 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Investment property under construction Investment property under construction is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property under construction are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Surplus land Surplus land is recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Any gains and losses on surplus land are recognised through the income statement.
Impairment of assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net selling price and its value-in-use ie the net present value of its future cash flows discounted at the Groups average pre-tax interest rate that reflects the borrowing costs and risk for the asset.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policy in respect of interest rates is to maintain a balance between flexibility and the hedging of interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The Group has not adopted hedge accounting.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
The outstanding derivative financial instruments mature in 2015, accordingly they have been transferred to non-current liabilities and the comparative amounts adjusted accordingly.
B Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
C Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
D Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
The carrying amounts of these assets approximates to the fair value.
E Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
72 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2010 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued F Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
G Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
H Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Retirement benefit costs Pension costs represent contributions payable to defined contribution schemes and are charged as an expense to the income statement as they fall due.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a Estimate of Fair Value of Investment Properties and Investment Property Under Construction The Groups self storage centres and stores under development are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology which is based on projections of net operating income.
The Group employs expert external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP, who report on the values of the Groups stores on a biannual basis.
Principal assumptions underlying managements estimation of the fair value are those related to: stabilised occupancy levels: the absorption period to these stabilised levels: expected future growth in storage rents and operating costs: maintenance requirements: capitalisation rates and discount rates.
A more detailed explanation of the background and methodology adopted in the valuation of the Groups investment properties is set out in note 14 to the accounts.
b Surplus land The Groups surplus land is held in the balance sheet at historic cost less provisions for impairment and is not valued externally.
The Directors review all surplus land assets for impairment at each balance sheet date, considering all available evidence as to the likely proceeds receivable from the sale of the surplus land.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and returns approach, with the Groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
Given the nature of the Groups business, there remains one segment, which is the provision of self storage accommodation and related services.
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of self storage accommodation and related services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax.
The Groups net assets, revenue and profit before tax are attributable to one activity, the provision of self storage accommodation and related services.
These all arise in the United Kingdom in the current year 2009: 150,000 of income which arose in the Emirate of Dubai.
