An amount of $8.0 million previously and provisionally recognised as goodwill has been re-allocated to other intangible assets.
Included with additions to goodwill is an increase of $1.1 million from the Fancor acquisition and a decrease of $1.1 million relating to amounts received from the former owners of Deuchem relating to the settlement of some outstanding warranty issues.
The total amount of goodwill and intangibles relating to the Fancor acquisition is therefore $9.2 million and is analysed in Note 30.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to bene t from that business combination.
The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products $301.8 million and Elementis Surfactants $3.5 million.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that re ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the CGUs.
The discount rate used in 2010 was 10.6 per cent 2009: 10.3 per cent.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash ows for the following 17 years based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5 per cent.
The rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The brand intangible represents the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the recent Deuchem and Fancor acquisitions.
The Group considers these to have signi cant and ongoing value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate to assign these assets an inde nite useful life.
The remaining intangible assets comprise of the value ascribed to customer lists, patents and noncompete clauses, which are being amortised over periods of five to ten years.
Other intangible assets comprise mainly of the value ascribed to the brand and customer lists acquired as part of the Deuchem acquisition.
The customer list is being amortised over a useful economic life of ten years.

Where this is not the case, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to re ect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is in uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an in uence on credit risk.
No single customer accounts for a signi cant proportion of the Groups revenue and geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The main components of this allowance are a speci c loss component that relates to individually signi cant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identi ed.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a credit rating of at least A1 from Standard & Poors and A from Moodys.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have suf cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.
At the year end the Group had $105.9 million 2009: $127.2 million of undrawn committed facilities, of which $95.0 million expires after more than one year.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the Euro and the US dollar.
The Group hedges approximately 70 per cent of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
66 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2010 COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash ows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily US dollar, but also Euro and pounds sterling.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.
The Groups investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US dollar denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of subsidiarys net assets.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to borrow at both xed and oating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest pro le.
The policy does not require that a speci c proportion of the Groups borrowings are at xed rates of interest.
Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held within the Groups fide ned bene t pension obligations.
Management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise investment returns in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded bene t obligations: management is assisted by external advisers in this regard.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage and sale requirements: such contracts are not settled net.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market con dence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group fide fines as total shareholders equity, excluding minority interests, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Groups savings related share option schemes.
At present, employees, including executive directors, hold 0.2 per cent 2009: 0.3 per cent of ordinary shares, or four per cent 2009: 3.1 per cent assuming that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Groups target is to achieve a return on shareholders equity of between 10 and 15 per cent: in 2010 the return was 28.8 per cent 2009: negative 14.4 per cent.
In comparison the weighted average interest expense on interest-bearing borrowings excluding liabilities with imputed interest was 2.4 per cent 2009: 2.0 per cent.

Derivatives level1 The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest based on government bonds.
Non-derivatives financial liabilities level2 Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables level3 The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash ows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows: 2010 2009 per cent per cent Derivatives 4.1 4.1 Borrowings 2.4 3.8 0.8 4.4 72 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2010 COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 23 Operating leases 2010 2009 $million $million Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 3.9 3.7 At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2010 2009 $million $million Within one year 2.4 0.6 In the second to fifth years inclusive 7.5 6.6 After five years 22.4 2.6 32.3 9.8 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties, plant and machinery.
Leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
24 Retirement bene t obligations The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement bene t plans providing retirement bene ts for the majority of employees and executive directors.
The main schemes in the UK, US and the Netherlands are of the fide ned bene t type, the bene t being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post-retirement medical bene t PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these bene ts is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2008 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2009 for the US and Netherlands schemes.
The UK actuarial valuation has been updated to 31 December 2010 for inclusion within this Annual Report.
The assumed life expectancies on retirement are: UK US Netherlands 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 years years years years years years Retiring at 31 December 2010 Males 21 20 19 19 19 19 Females 23 23 21 21 21 21 Retiring in 20 years Males 24 22 21 21 19 19 Females 25 24 22 22 21 21 The principal assumptions used by the actuaries were as follows: UK US Netherlands per cent per cent per cent 2010 Rate of increase in salaries 4.60 3.45 2.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.50 N A N A Discount rate 5.40 5.75 4.75 In ation 3.60 3.00 2.00 2009 Rate of increase in salaries 4.60 3.45 2.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.50 N A N A Discount rate 5.50 6.25 5.25 In ation 3.60 3.25 2.00 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 3.80 3.45 2.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.80 N A 0.25 Discount rate 6.40 6.25 5.75 In ation 2.80 3.25 2.00 Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc 73 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 continued 24 Retirement bene t obligations continued The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 5.75 per cent 2009: 6.25 per cent per annum and a health care cost trend of 7.0 per cent 2009: 10.0 per cent per annum for claims pre age 65 reducing to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2018 2009: 4.5 per cent.
Actuarial valuations of retirement bene t plans in other jurisdictions have either not been updated for IAS 19 purposes or disclosed separately because of the costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.
Following recent announcements by the Government that it intends to use CPI as the statutory rate for pension purposes, liabilities within the UK pension scheme were positively impacted by $11.7 million as CPI will be the basis in the future for revaluing deferred pensions rather than RPI.

The Company has since 1998 operated an approved and unapproved, discretionary executive share option scheme for executive directors and other senior and middle managers in the Group.
Under the current 2003 scheme, which replaced the 1998 scheme, the option price is the market price of a share on the dealing day immediately preceding the day on which the option is granted with no discount applied.
Options are ordinarily capable of exercise after three years, subject to earnings per share and total shareholder return performance targets being met, and within ten years of the date of the grant.
The 1998 and 2008 UK Savings-Related Share Option Schemes are schemes under which UK employees can enter into savings contracts with a building society or a bank for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average market price over the five working days preceding the invitation date discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent.
The 1998 scheme expired in 2008, although options are still outstanding under that scheme, and was replaced by the 2008 scheme.
The 2000 and 2008 US Savings-Related Share Option Schemes are schemes under which US employees can enter into savings contracts with a bank for a period of two years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the market price on the date of the grant, discounted by 15 per cent.
The 2000 scheme expired in 2008, and was replaced by the 2008 scheme.
Options were valued using the binomial option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2010 2009 Fair value per option pence 34.6 10.5 Expected volatility per cent 58.0 49.0 Risk free rate per cent 2.5 1.8 Expected dividend yield per cent 4.4 5.0 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $1.4 million 2009: $0.9 million related to equity-settled share based payment transactions during the year which includes awards made under the long term incentive plan as amended in 2010 as shown in the table overleaf.
The table overleaf shows all outstanding options granted under the executive and savings related share option schemes.
The Company also made a grant of awards in 2008 under the long term incentive plan 2008 LTIP were made to four senior executives that owing to the nature of the awards have not been shown in the table overleaf but are set out on page 38 of the Directors remuneration report.
The 2008 LTIP awards were valued using the binomial method and an IFRS 2 expense of $0.5 million 2009: $0.5 million was recognised.

The Company is a guarantor to the UK pension scheme under which it guarantees all current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently participating in the pension scheme to make payments to the scheme, up to a speci ed maximum amount.
The maximum amount of the guarantee is that which is needed at the time the guarantee is called on to bring the schemes funding level up to 105 per cent of its liabilities, calculated in accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund PPF guarantee, as having such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.

Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc 81 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 continued 30 Acquisitions On 24 December 2009 the Group acquired substantially all of the trading assets of the Fanning Corporation and Fancor Ltd for cash consideration of $9.2 million.
Fancor is one of the largest North American suppliers of lanolin and lanolin derivatives and its acquisition has expanded the Groups presence in the personal care market.
Because of the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end, a provisional fair valuing exercise was performed for the 2009 Annual Report using book values at the acquisition date.
The difference between consideration paid and net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill.
Following the fair valuing exercise and on the basis of the revised net asset values, the difference has been allocated to goodwill, brand and other intangibles.
On account of the strength of the brand and the Groups intention to maintain it going forwards, the brand is treated as having an inde nite useful life.
Other intangibles, which include customer lists, patents and non-compete clauses are being amortised over periods of five to ten years.

A provision is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an out ow of economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation.
Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and that the probability of a material out ow is not remote, the Group would disclose a contingent liability.
Elementis LTP Inc. LTP has been named as a defendant in chromium-related litigation currently pending in the State of Missouri the Missouri Litigation.
The Missouri Litigation developed into the following types of cases: 1 approximately a dozen cases involving over 180 individual plaintiffs alleging property and or personal injury: 2 a class action seeking property damages for an unspeci ed number of putative class members: and 3 a class action seeking medical monitoring damages for putative class members who live in a four county area.
Between December 2010 and January 2011, three of the individual plaintiff cases described in clause 1 above involving approximately 130 individual plaintiffs and the medical monitoring class action described in clause 3 above were voluntarily dismissed.
In the remaining cases, the plaintiffs allege exposure to a chromium compound as the result of processes utilised by a tannery in St. Joseph, Missouri that was owned by Prime Tanning, Corp. Prime Tanning.
LTP has been named as the procurer of sodium dichromate for another defendant, Wismo Chemical Corp. Wismo.
Wismo was located onsite at the tannery and was in the business of converting sodium dichromate upon delivery by LTP into chromium sulphate a chemical agent that is commonly used in the tanning of hides.
Wismo, in turn, sold the chromium sulphate to Prime Tanning.
50 per cent of the shares of Wismo had been owned by LTP, its af liates or its predecessors, but such shares were sold to Prime Tanning prior to LTP being named as a defendant in the Missouri Litigation proceedings.
Management, after consultation with legal counsel, has concluded that the proceedings are unlikely to be adversely determined against LTP and thus would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
None of the proceedings is scheduled to go to trial before the beginning of 2012.
