Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies Rathbone Brothers Plc the Company is a public company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the first time and consequently IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards has been applied: the Company financial statements are presented on page 109.
Developments in reporting Standards and Interpretations Standards affecting the financial statements In the current year, there have been no new or revised Standards and Interpretations that have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results or the financial position The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements: IFRS 3, Business Combinations revised 2008 IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised 2008 IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners Amendments to IFRS 2, Share-based Payments: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations & Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions The following amendments were made as part of Improvements to IFRS 2009 : Amendments to IAS 38 Intangible Assets Amendments to IFRS 8 Operating Segments Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets New Standards and Interpretations A number of new standards, amendments to Standards and Interpretations, are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2010, and therefore have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these is expected to have a significant affect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except for IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which is not yet adopted by the EU and is expected to become mandatory for the Groups 2013 consolidated financial statements and could change the classification and measurement of financial assets.
The Group does not plan to adopt this standard early and the extent of the impact has not been determined.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries, together the Group, made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether an entity is a subsidiary of the Company.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements up to the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred.
For subsidiaries with non-coterminous year ends, financial statements are drawn up to 31 December for the purposes of consolidation.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2010 68 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the business review on page 23.
Net interest income Interest income and expense are recognised as earned in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost and for available for sale debt instruments using the effective interest method.
Dividends receivable from money market funds are included within net interest income.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees and interest paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
Dividend income Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interim dividends are recognised when received.
Operating leases Lease agreements which do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease expense recognised in the income statement is adjusted for the impact of any lease incentives.
Fees and commissions Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised over the period the service is provided.
Asset management fees are recognised evenly over the period the service is provided.
Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned.
To the extent that retained initial charge income received on the sale of units arises from an identifiable brokerage service, the income is recognised on the performance of that service.
Other retained initial charges are deferred and recognised as income on a straight line basis over the estimated average life of the unit holding.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases: Leasehold property: over the lease term Plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to ten years The assets residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Rathbone Brothers Plc 69 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Report and accounts 2010 1 Principal accounting policies continued Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or when other occasions or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to groups of cash generating units that correspond with the Groups segments, as these represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitor goodwill for purposes of impairment testing.
Cash generating units are identified as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributed amount of goodwill that has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date and annually thereafter.
b Computer software and software development costs Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised on the basis of the expected useful lives three to four years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the recognition requirements of IAS 38 are met.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their useful lives not exceeding four years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs that are not recognised as assets are recognised as an expense as incurred.
c Client relationships Client relationships acquired are initially recognised at cost.
Those in respect of business combinations are initially recognised at fair value.
Client relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the client relationships over their estimated useful lives ten to fifteen years.
When client relationships are lost the full amount of unamortised cost is recognised immediately and the intangible asset is derecognised.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held to maturity investments and available for sale financial assets.
The classification of financial assets is determined at initial recognition.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.
a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated.
Derivatives, which are categorised as fair value through profit or loss, are reported within other assets or other liabilities.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services to a debtor or purchases a loan with no intention of trading the receivable.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
c Held to maturity Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, other than those that meet the definition of loans and receivables or that the Group has classified as available for sale or fair value through profit or loss.
Held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2010 70 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued d Available for sale Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Available for sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held to maturity and available for sale are recognised on trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Loans are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or been effectively transferred, or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available for sale financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and presented in the available for sale reserve in equity, until the financial asset is sold, derecognised or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity should be recognised in the income statement.
However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Impairment Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and when there is an indication of impairment.
Financial assets and other assets with finite useful lives are assessed at the reporting date or if there is objective evidence of impairment during the accounting period.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Held to maturity investment securities and loans and receivables are considered individually for impairment.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the higher of fair value less any cost to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
The recoverable amount of held to maturity investment securities and loans and receivables is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset on recognition.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment of available for sale securities is calculated as the cumulative loss that has been previously recognised directly in equity at the time that objective evidence of impairment is identified.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of any asset, except for goodwill, equity instruments or cash generating units, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, which is no greater than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
An impairment loss in respect of a held to maturity investment security or loans and receivables is reversed only if the value increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in equity instruments classified as available for sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment is reversed through profit or loss.
Rathbone Brothers Plc 71 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Report and accounts 2010 1 Principal accounting policies continued Deposits and borrowings All deposits and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, deposits and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discounts or premia on settlement.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised within interest expense.
Foreign currencies The Companys functional and the Groups presentational currency is Sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the relevant Group entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date.
Non-monetary financial assets carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the Groups presentational currency at exchange rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in equity within the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are transferred to equity in the period in which the operation is disposed.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Gains and losses arising on translation are taken to the Groups translation reserve.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments denominated in a currency other than the Groups functional currency arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as non-monetary foreign currency items and they are translated using the exchange rate applied on the date of acquisition.
Retirement benefit obligations The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each statement of financial position date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the amended benefits become vested.
The amount recognised in the statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Death in service benefits are provided to all employees through the pension schemes.
The amount recognised in the statement of financial position for death in service benefits represents the present value of the estimated obligation, reduced by the extent to which any future liabilities will be met by insurance policies.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax receivable or payable is the expected tax receivable or payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax receivable or payable in respect of previous years.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2010 72 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Taxation continued Deferred tax is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises: from the initial recognition of goodwill for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes: or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, other than in a business combination.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is the Groups intention not to reverse the temporary difference in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise money market funds which are realisable on demand and loans and advances to banks with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Share-based payments The Group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees.
In relation to equity settled share-based payments, the fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
Except for those which include terms related to market conditions, vesting conditions included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in the income statement reflects the number of vested shares or share options, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market related vesting condition is met, provided that the non-market vesting conditions are met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
For cash settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services received, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At the date on which the liability is settled, and at each statement of financial position date between grant date and settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Segmental reporting The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Group Executive Committee, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and Rathbone Brothers Plc 73 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Report and accounts 2010 1 Principal accounting policies continued Segmental reporting continued expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components, whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group Executive Committee to make decisions about resources allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Operating segments are organised around the services provided to clients, a description of the services provided by each segment is given in Rathbones at a glance on page 6.
No operating segments have been aggregated in the Groups financial statements.
Transactions between operating segments are reported within the income or expenses for those segments.
Indirect costs are allocated between segments in proportion to the principal cost driver for each category of indirect costs that is generated by each segment.
Fiduciary activities The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions.
Such assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group.
The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Such monies and the corresponding amounts due to clients are not shown on the face of the statement of financial position as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
Financial guarantees The Group provides a limited number of financial guarantees which are fully backed by assets in clients portfolios.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the contract.
2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Client relationship intangibles The Group makes estimates about the expected duration of client relationships to determine the period over which related intangible assets are amortised.
The amortisation period is estimated with reference to historical data on account closure rates and managements expectations for the future.
During the year client relationship intangible assets were amortised over a 10 15 year period.
Amortisation of 4,845,000 was charged during the year.
A reduction in the average amortisation period of 1 year would increase the amortisation charge by approximately 410,000.
In determining whether a client relationship is lost management consider factors such as the level of funds withdrawn and the existence of other retained family relationships.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme levies The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS to protect depositors and investors from loss in the event of failure of financial institutions have resulted in significant FSCS levies on the industry.
The financial impact of FSCS levies are largely out of the Groups control as they result from other industry failures.
The FSCS announced on 20 January 2011 that it would be raising an interim levy of 326 million, principally to cover the cost of compensating investors from the failure of Keydata Investment Services Limited Keydata and other intermediaries.
On 24 January 2011 the Group received invoices totalling 3,203,000 for the Keydata and other intermediary failures.
This cost has been charged to profit in the financial statements and recognised within accruals.
It is possible that the FSCS will make future recoveries from third parties and from the underlying assets for which compensation is being paid.
However, the timing and total amount of these recoveries is uncertain, as is the Groups share of any recoveries made.
The total amount relating to FSCS levies charged to the income statement during 2010 was 3,575,000.
Vendor loan notes As described in note 15, the Group has issued vendor loan notes notes with a nominal value of 5,000,000 to the acquirer of the Groups Jersey trust operations in 2008.
The notes are repayable on the occurrence of certain events, principally the refinancing of the operations disposed of.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2010 74 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued Vector loan notes continued The carrying value of the notes has been calculated as 3,267,000 using a discounted cash flow model based on the estimated repayment date, using a discount rate equal to the initial effective interest rate of the loan.
Changing the estimated repayment date of the notes by one year would result in an increase or decrease in their carrying value of approximately 250,000.
A 1% increase decrease in the assumed rate at which interest accrues under the loan would increase decrease the carrying value of the loan by approximately 96,000.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group makes estimates about a range of long term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the deficit on its retirement benefit schemes, based on the Groups expectations of the future and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported deficit of 6,643,000 are given in note 25.
Long term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be significantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the Group then the reported surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may be materially different.
The history of experience adjustments and information on the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation to changes in underlying estimates is set out in note 25.
3 Segmental information Operating segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions: Investment Management, Unit Trusts and Trust and Tax Services.
The products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are described in Rathbones at a glance on page 6.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its performance to the Executive Committee.
Certain items of income are presented within different categories of operating income in the financial statements compared to the presentation for internal reporting.
The information presented in this note follows the presentation for internal reporting to the Group Executive Committee.

The failure of Keydata Investment Services Limited Keydata and other intermediaries resulted in a considerable increase in the levy made by the FSCS to the Group.
The Group has accrued 3,575,000 in 2010 in respect of its share of the cost of FSCS borrowings including a provision for the 2010 2011 levy year, of which 3,203,000 relates to Keydata and other intermediaries note 23.
Recoveries in future years by the FSCS may become available to offset this liability but the amount and timing of these is highly uncertain and no allowance has been made for these in calculating this liability.
Further charges for historical failures by financial institutions are likely to be incurred in future years and the ultimate cost remains uncertain note 30.
2 During 2009, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire certain discretionary investment management assets and operations note 20.
Legal and professional fees and staff incentive payments totalling 782,000 were recognised during 2009 in relation to this.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Investment Management 45,287 45,287 Trust and Tax Services 1,954 1,954 47,241 47,241 The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management, covering the forthcoming year based on flat market assumptions and organic growth in line with historical rates.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to ten years based on a medium to long term growth rate of 3% for the Investment Management CGU and 2% for the Trust and Tax Services CGU 2009: 3% and 2% respectively based on managements expectation of future industry growth rates.
A ten year extrapolation period is chosen based on managements expectation of the duration of client relationships.
The pre tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10% for Investment Management and 12% for Trust and Tax Services 2009: 10% and 12% respectively based on a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital and reflecting the relatively small size of the Trust and Tax Services CGU.

Scheme assets are held separately from those of the Group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.

Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 519,000 of related insurance premia were expensed to the income statement in the year 2009: 547,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
During the year the Group changed its insurance arrangements and substantially eliminated the uninsured element of this benefit.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries every three years using the projected unit credit method which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each statement of financial position date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2007 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2008 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered by the liability, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: 2010 2009 2010 2009 Laurence Keen Laurence Keen Rathbone 1987 Rathbone 1987 Scheme % Scheme % Scheme % Scheme % Rate of increase in salaries 4.85 4.85 4.85 4.85 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.70 3.70 3.50 3.50 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 3.60 3.60 3.60 3.60 Discount rate 5.40 5.70 5.40 5.70 Expected return on scheme assets 5.90 6.00 6.70 7.00 1 Inflation 3.60 3.60 3.60 3.60 1 Inflation assumptions are based on the Retail Prices Index Rathbone Brothers Plc 89 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Report and accounts 2010 25 Long term employee benefits continued The assumed duration of the liabilities for the Laurence Keen Scheme is 18 years 2009: 18 years and the assumed duration for the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 24 years 2009: 24 years.

The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the Groups risk appetite.
i Credit risk The Group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and pensions advisory activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds with other banks and holding interest bearing securities.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk through its loan books, guarantees given on clients behalf and loans made to the acquirers of the Groups Jersey and Switzerland operations in 2008 and 2009.
It is the Groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by Group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The Group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Ltd Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the Banking Committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
Rathbone Brothers Plc 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Report and accounts 2010 28 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued The Investment Management and Unit Trust businesses have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances arising in the Investment Management segment are primarily in relation to client trades and risk of nonsettlement is borne by clients.
Loans and advances to banks and debt and other securities The Group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds and government bonds.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of surplus investment management client cash, which is held under a banking relationship, and the Groups own reserves.
The Groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long term rating of A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis and reviewed by the Banking Committee on a monthly basis.
The Banking Committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans to clients through its Investment Management operations the Investment Management loan book.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk on trade debtors arising from the Trust and Tax and Pensions Advisory businesses trust and pension debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time to time due to short term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on a clients behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the Banking Committee on a monthly basis.
b Investment Management loan book Loans and short term overdrafts are provided as a service to Investment Management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name and are advanced for a maximum of one year.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted subject to credit criteria.
The Banking Committee reviews all loans on a monthly basis and approves all loan extensions.
Where necessary, repayment plans are established with clients before loans become overdue or uncovered.
At 31 December, the total lending exposure limit for the Investment Management loan book was 45,000,000 2009: 30,000,000 of which 31,957,000 had been advanced 2009: 18,712,000 and a further 7,724,000 had been committed 2009: 5,260,000. c Trust and pension debtors Trust and pension debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and pension debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Management Committees of the Groups Trust and Pension Advisory companies.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
d Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers are constituted by loans made to the acquirers of the Groups Jersey trust operations in 2008 and its Switzerland trust operations in 2009 note 15.
Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the statement of financial position date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the statement of financial position date on a case by case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and pension debtors, are set out in note 15.
No other impairment losses arose during the year 2009: none.

The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements.
Rathbone Investment Management the bank also has a regulatory requirement to maintain adequate liquidity to ensure that there is no significant risk that its liabilities cannot be met as they fall due.
The controls and policies that ensure these requirements are met are now documented in an Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA in response to additional regulatory requirements applicable to the 2010 financial year.
This assessment process was implemented in 2010 and is expected to be reviewed by the Financial Services Authority in 2011.
Liquidity risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments that are realisable at short notice.
The Group operates a strict set of criteria for counterparties to ensure that investments are liquid and placed with high quality counterparties.
The Group does not rely on external funding for its activities.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the Groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the Groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the Banking Committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is expected to rise and shortens it when the yield curve is expected to fall.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest bearing assets.
At 31 December 2010, the bank had 734.2 million 2009: 738.5 million of Sterling interest bearing liabilities averaging two days 2009: two days to repricing which were matched by Sterling assets averaging 89 days 2009: 74 days to repricing, creating an exposure of 87 days 2009: 72 days.

Rathbone Brothers Plc 103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Report and accounts 2010 28 Financial risk management continued iii Mark et risk continued Foreign exchange risk The Group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts, from time to time, so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The Groups structural currency exposure was substantially eliminated on the disposal of its Switzerland, Singapore, British Virgin Islands and Dutch operations during 2009 and 2010 note 10.
The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk.
The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December 2010.
Included in the table are the Groups financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2010 104 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 Financial risk management continued iii Mark et risk continued Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 16.
At 31 December 2010, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the statement of financial position was 3,087,000 2009: 2,932,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 309,000 2009: 293,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of held to maturity investment securities note 16.
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year.
Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value.
Rathbone Brothers Plc 105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Report and accounts 2010 29 Capital management Rathbone Brothers Plcs capital is defined for accounting purposes as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves.
The Company has external borrowings of 3,089,000 at 31 December 2010 2009: 6,155,000 note 21 which are not considered to be part of accounting capital given their very short maturity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: maintain a strong capital base to be able to support the development of the business when required: optimise the distribution of capital across Group companies reflecting the requirements of each business: strive to make capital freely transferable across the Group where possible: and comply with regulatory requirements at all times.
Rathbones is classified under the Capital Requirements Directive CRD as a banking group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP which is presented to the FSA on an annual basis.
Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with CRD rules.
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets.
The ICAAP compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the CRDs Pillar I and Pillar II methodology.
The Group has adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar I credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk component.
Capital management policy and practices are applied at both Group and entity level.
At 31 December 2010 the Groups regulatory capital resources, including retained earnings for 2010, were 85,250,000 2009: 94,462,000.
The reduction is principally due to the increase in intangible assets during 2010.
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP process, and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are monitored and forecasted on a monthly basis to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against adverse business conditions.
Regular exercises are also run to ensure that the Group structures remain optimal.
Regulatory capital requirements have been met throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2009 and 2010.
