Discontinued operations In May 2010, the Group sold its Emmerich site and associated business in Germany to KLK Emmerich GmbH, a subsidiary of the KLK Group Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad, for 55.0m.
The Emmerich site produced fatty acids and glycerine, most of which were sold into the Industrial Specialities market.
The profit before tax on the sale of the site of 0.9m has been disclosed as exceptional.
As part of the transaction, KLK assumed the IAS 19 retirement benefit obligations relating to the business of 38.4m such that cash receivable by the Group was 16.6m.
The sale represents a further exit from the commodity oleochemicals sector and largely completes the Groups restructuring programme established following the 2006 acquisition of Uniqema.
In April 2009, in line with the same strategy to reduce exposure to basic commodity sectors, the Group announced the closure of its operations at Bromborough in Merseyside, United Kingdom.
This represented an exit from the commodity oleochemicals sector in the UK.
There was an exceptional pre-tax credit of 3.0m in 2010 in relation to this discontinued business.
Since the balance sheet date, in January 2011, the Group has completed the sale of its 60% holding in its Korean joint venture, Croda Woobang, to the Korean joint venture partners for a consideration of 2.2m.
It is expected that this will generate a profit on disposal of 0.5m.
The trading results of Croda Woobang have been classified as discontinued and the companys assets have been classified as held for sale in the Group balance sheet.

In all territories, including the UK, assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice from the Groups actuaries, published statistics and experience in each territory.
The following mortality tables have been used in respect of the Groups key schemes: UK: PA92 Calendar year 2005 -3 for current non-pensioners and PA92 Calendar year 2005 -2 for pensioners: USA: UP 1994 Projected to 2002 by Scale AA: Netherlands: AG Prognosetafel 2008-2050.
UK pension schemes The financial assumptions used to assess the UK schemes liabilities were: 2010 2009 Valuation method Projected unit Projected unit Discount rate 5.5% 5.7% Inflation rate 3.8% 3.8% Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% 5.0% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.6% 3.8% Expected return on scheme assets 8.0% 8.0% 2010 2009 The assets in the schemes comprised: % of fair value % of fair value Equities 42.5 58.3 Bonds 20.9 16.1 Property 7.7 8.3 Other 28.9 17.3 100.0 100.0 For funded schemes throughout the Group, the expected return on scheme assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes.
The expected return for each class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets as suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.

Intangible assets Goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant cash generating units CGU recoverable amount compared to the units carrying value including goodwill.
The relevant CGU when testing the Uniqema goodwill of 193.4m is the Groups Consumer Care operating segment.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the Groups current year results and a future growth rate of 3% 2009: 3%.
The cashflows have been discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 7.5% before tax 2009: 6.8%.
The key assumptions underpinning the forecast employed in the value in use calculation reflect a prudent view of past experience and are that market share will not change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.
The directors believe there are no significant changes in assumptions which would give rise to an impairment charge in the year.

Interest is charged at a floating rate based on LIBOR or EURIBOR, depending upon the drawdown currency, plus a variable margin.
The margin the Group pays on its borrowings over and above standard rates is determined by the Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio.

The loan note is repayable in 2020 and carries a fixed rate of 5.94%.
The interest rate swaps held as a cashflow hedge at the 2009 year end expired on 31 January 2010.
As at 31 December 2010, aside from the $100m loan note, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2010, the Groups fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 5.94% 2009: 5.19%.
The Groups floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.
Fair values The table below details a comparison of the book and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.
Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2010 2010 2009 2009 m m m m Cash deposits 64.8 64.8 45.0 45.0 Other investments 14.0 14.0 12.5 12.5 2010 Club facility due 2015 210.6 210.6 $100m fixed rate 10 year bond 63.7 65.7 Syndicated acquisition funding 265.5 265.5 136m term facility 33.8 33.8 Other bank borrowings 10.0 10.0 33.4 33.4 Obligations under finance leases 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 Interest rate swaps 0.3 0.3 For financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one year, fair values are based on cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates.
Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.
As noted in the accounting policies note on page 55, the Groups management of its currency risk includes the use of forward foreign currency contracts.
The fair value of the contracts in place at 31 December 2010 was 0.2m 2009: 0.4m.

Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued Financial instruments Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following hierarchy: l Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : l Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and l Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
All of the Groups financial instruments are classified as level 1.

The environmental provision relates to soil and potential ground water contamination on a number of sites, both currently in use and previously occupied, in Europe and the Americas.
Restructuring provisions relate to the remaining costs associated with the ongoing plans to finalise the integration of the Uniqema business acquired in 2006 with the existing Croda businesses and the remaining costs associated with the closure of our Wilton site.
In relation to the environmental provision, the directors consider that the balance will be utilised within 20 years.
With regard to the restructuring provision, the directors view is that the balance will be largely utilised during 2011.
Based on information currently available and on the detailed plans established for the restructuring of the Group, this level of provision is considered appropriate by the directors.
The Group has considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in a relatively short timescale, the impact is immaterial.

Where appropriate the expected volatility has been based on historic volatility considering daily share price movements over periods equal to the expected future life of the awards and the risk free rate is based on the Bank of Englands projected nominal yield curve with appropriate duration.
Croda Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE scheme, established in 1983, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise price, being the market price of the Companys shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%.
Employees then enter into a savings contract over three to five years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are then exercisable for a six month period following completion of the savings contract.
As the option is equity settled, under IFRS 2 charges are only made in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002.
For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows: Grant date 2010 Share price at grant date 1431p Exercise price 1144p Number of employees 370 Shares under option 94,501 Vesting period 3 years Expected volatility 35% Option life 6 months Expected life Risk free rate 1.3% Dividend yield 1.7% Possibility of forfeiture 7.5% p. a.

At exercise, employees are paid a cash equivalent for each option purchased, being the difference between the exercise price and market price at the exercise date.
As the scheme is cash settled, IFRS 2 applies to all options in existence during the year, regardless of grant date.

Under the SIP scheme, employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month.
For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards a matching share which passes to the employee after three years service.
The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation.
