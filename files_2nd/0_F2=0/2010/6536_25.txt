A linear scale will be applied when performance falls between the bands.
Prior to the vesting of any grant, the Remuneration Committee reviews the basis of calculation of growth in underlying EPS to satisfy itself that the performance conditions have been met.
Shares granted to a participant under a conditional share award automatically transfer to a participant in the Plan and become a taxable benefit upon the decision of the Remuneration Committee that a grant or part shall vest.
Under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan grants are made to incentivise middle management Executive Directors and senior management do not participate in this plan and the vesting of options is also conditional on achievement of growth in underlying earnings per share exceeding RPI 5% over a three year period.
It is the Companys policy to phase the granting of share options rather than to award them in a single large block to any individual.
Details of grants made to Directors are shown in the table of Directors interests on page 39 and details of the performance criteria for the Companys share award and share option schemes are also included in note 31 to the financial statements.
Benefits-in-Kind The Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car or car allowance, life cover and private medical insurance.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent Company financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: properly select and apply accounting policies: present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information: and provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance: and make an assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Reporting entity Genus plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is Belvedere House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4HG.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business Review.
The Group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the equity method is used to account for the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The significant accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Restatement in the 2009 and 2008 balance sheet The balance sheet comparatives for the years ended 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008 have been restated to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of future tax deductions available on the purchase of intangible assets in 1998 by a subsidiary of Sygen plc, prior to its acquisition by Genus.
A deferred tax asset should have been recorded separately in the consolidated accounts of Genus plc upon the acquisition of Sygen plc in December 2005, rather than being included within the goodwill recorded on acquisition.
Since acquisition, the group has taken the benefit of this tax deduction in the current tax charge, with an appropriate deferred tax charge being recorded.
However, instead of reducing the deferred tax asset that should have been recorded on acquisition, the Group recorded a deferred tax liability.
In order to rectify the position, the prior period balance sheet at 30 June 2009 has been restated in accordance with IAS 8, and, in accordance with IAS 1 revised, a balance sheet at 30 June 2008 is also presented together with related notes.
The amounts involved are a reduction in goodwill at 30 June 2009 of 7.9m 2008: 6.6m, a reduction in deferred tax liabilities at 30 June 2009 of 2.6m 2008: 1.0m and an increase in deferred tax assets at 30 June 2009 of 5.3m 2008: 5.6m.
There has been no effect on the income statement, cash flows or shareholders equity recorded as a result of this restatement.
Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current years presentation as described in the relevant notes.
Functional and presentation currency The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
All financial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest million at one decimal point.
Basis of measurement The Group financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the following, in accordance with IFRS: biological assets are measured at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of distribution and selling expenses: and derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in note 4.
Going concern As set out in the Directors Responsibility Statement, after reviewing the available information including the Groups business plans and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of subsidiaries sold cease to be consolidated from the date on which control passes.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The Group financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
Backward Contents Forward Backward Contents Forward Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Overview 48 Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2010 2.
Basis of preparation continued Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The Group financial statements include the Groups share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Non GAAP measures Adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit before tax Adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit before tax from continuing operations are defined before the net IAS 41 valuation movements in biological assets, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based payments expense, exceptional items and other gains and losses.
This additional non-GAAP measure of operating performance is included as the Directors believe that they provide a useful alternative measure for shareholders of the trading performance of the Group.
The reconciliation between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is shown on the face of the income statement.
The Directors recognise this alternative measure has limitations.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency of the relevant Group entity at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the Group income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation into Sterling of foreign operations, and the fair value movement of related effective hedges, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
The Group has elected to reset the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to zero at the date of transition to IFRS 1 April 2005.
Exchange movements on intercompany loans designated as long-term funding are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve, together with any related taxation.
Significant accounting policies Business combinations All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the profit and loss as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities which meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture represents the excess of the cost of acquisition excluding transaction costs over the Groups interests in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Identifiable assets include any intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate.
Backward Contents Forward Backward Contents Forward Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 49 As required by IAS 21, goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the acquired operation on acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity rather than assets or liabilities of the acquiring entity, and are therefore expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operation and retranslated at the balance sheet date.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities and when research projects satisfy the condition for achieving technical feasibility and are commercially viable, the Groups policy is to capitalise further development costs in accordance with IAS 38.
The Groups development activities comprise the development and maintenance of the porcine genetic nucleus herd and the development and maintenance of bovine pre-stud herds.
The Group does not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds as their fair value is included within the fair value of the Groups biological assets in accordance with IAS 41.
The Group discloses the costs incurred in research and herd development activities as required by IAS 38.
Exceptional items The Group presents items which the Directors believe to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence as exceptional.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired by the Group in a business combination subsequent to 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably.
The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 2 to 10 years Porcine genetics technology 20 years Multiplier contracts 15 years Customer relationships 15 to 17 years Intangible assets acquired separately Intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups tangible and intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% 2009: 11.4%, the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
As the Group comprises two large well diversified businesses the Directors believe that this approach reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

Significant accounting policies continued Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Biological assets and inventories The principal activity of the Group during the period was the global application of quantitative genetics and biotechnology to animal breeding.
The Group utilises these techniques to identify and select animals that possess the genetics genes responsible for superior milk and meat quality, high health and performance traits.
Genus sells breeding animals and semen to customers who produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality for the global dairy and meat supply chain.
In bovine, research and development is used to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, but primarily the Holstein dairy breed.
Progeny testing of the performance of daughters for each bull selected measures their performance against those of their peers.
Semen from the best bulls is collected and frozen to satisfy customer demand.
Semen from dairy breeds is used by farmers to breed replacement milking stock.
Semen sold from beef breeds is used in either specialist beef breeding herds for multiplication of breeding bulls for use in natural service or on dairy cows to produce a by-product to be reared for meat.
Bovine biological assets are held for long-term internal use and are classified as non-current assets.
Bull semen is transferred to inventory at fair value at point of harvest, which becomes the deemed cost under IAS 2.
Inventories are stated at the lower of this deemed cost and net realisable value.
Since the sorting of semen is not a biological process but a production process, semen inventory transferred into sexed semen production is transferred at fair value at point of harvest less cost to sell and becomes a component of the production process.
Sexed semen is carried in finished goods at production cost.
In porcine, a central breeding stock the nucleus herd is maintained and developed to provide genetically superior animals.
The animal genetics offer the potential to improve profitability for farmer and food processing customers by enabling them to increase output of consistently high quality products yielding higher value.
To allow the Group to capitalise on its intellectual property it almost entirely outsources production to its global multiplier network.
The offspring or semen obtained from animals in the nucleus herd is sold to customers for use in commercial farming.
The sale of semen is far less common as porcine semen is sold fresh and has a short life when frozen.
Sales of porcine animals generally occur in one of two ways: direct and indirect.
Under direct sales, the full fair value of the animal is receivable at point of transfer to the customer.
Under indirect sales, the pig is regarded as comprising of two separately identifiable components, its carcass and its inherent genetic potential.
The initial consideration, which approximates the carcass value of the animal, is receivable at the point that the pig is transferred to the customer.
The Group retains its interest in the genetic potential of the pig and consideration for the use of this genetic potential is received in the form of royalties.
The breeding animal biological assets owned by Genus and the retained interest in the biological assets sold under royalty contracts are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement within operating profit for the period.
Porcine biological assets which are in use as breeding animals are classified as non-current assets and are carried at fair value.
Porcine biological assets held with an intention of resale, being the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair value and classified as current assets.
The retained interest in the genetics from indirect sales is split between current and non-current assets based on the remaining expected life of the related animals.
Determination of fair values biological assets As required by IAS 41 Agriculture, the Group shows the carrying value of biological assets in the Group balance sheet determined according to the provisions of IAS 41 with the net valuation movements shown in the income statement.
There are important differences in the manner in which the value of the Groups bovine and porcine assets are arrived at, as explained below.
Bovine The fair value of proven bulls and bulls on test, proven bulls being those where the bulls semen is actively marketed, is based on expected future net cash flows from the sale of semen, the bulls harvest, discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate.
The fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory managed by the Group has been adjusted where a third party has a revenue share in the sale of semen from a particular bull.
The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, estimated production value, the expected marketable life of each bull and, in addition for bulls on test, the percentage whose production is expected to be actively marketed.
In assessing the sales price, management uses statistical data for the bulls produced by independent authorities, in all its major markets, three times a year.
In addition, estimates are also used to determine into which markets the semen will be sold, and domestic and export prices.
The fair value of bulls that have not yet entered the Group testing programme is equivalent to their acquisition and rearing costs.
Backward Contents Forward Backward Contents Forward Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 51 Porcine The fair values of porcine biological assets encompasses both the animals owned entirely by Genus and the retained interest in the genetics of those animals sold under royalty arrangements.
The fair value of animals owned by the Group is calculated using average live weights of the animals plus a premium where it is considered that they will be saleable for their favourable genetic characteristics.
The value attributed to the live weight of the pigs and the premium for genetics is based on recent transaction prices achieved by the Group.
The significant assumptions in determining fair values are the expected life of the breeding animals, the percentage of production animals which are expected to be saleable as breeding animals and the expected sales prices.
The fair value of the retained interest in the genetics of those animals sold under royalty contracts is initially based on the fair values achieved by the Group in recent transactions from direct sales of similar animals, less the values received up front for the sale of the carcass element.
The fair value of the retained interest is remeasured at each reporting date.
The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained interest is the expected life of the animal transferred under royalty contracts.
Non recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group In order to manage commercial risk a very large part of the Groups porcine business model involves the sale of pigs to farmers multipliers who produce piglets on farms neither managed nor controlled by the Group.
The Group has the option to purchase the offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium but no obligation to do so.
The Group then has the ability to sell the offspring to other farmers at a premium because the offspring has superior genetics.
The right to purchase offspring is not recognised on the balance sheet as the contracts are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt of non-financial items the offspring in accordance with the Groups expected purchase requirements.
As such the option is outside the scope of IAS 39.
The offspring are not recognised as biological assets under IAS 41 as they are neither owned nor controlled by the Group.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Land and assets not available for use are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 10 to 15 years Leasehold buildings over the term of the lease Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material less impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the expected life of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are discounted to present value.
Revenue Revenue comprises the invoiced value of sales and royalties receivable from customers, net of trade discounts and value added tax.
The principal components of the Groups revenue and their respective accounting treatments are: Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals and veterinary products is recognised upon transfer of risks and rewards, either upon shipment to customers or delivery depending on the terms of sale.
Backward Contents Forward Backward Contents Forward Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Overview 52 Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2010 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Royalties are recognised when receivable.
Royalty payments are received from certain porcine customers based on key performance variables such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average slaughter weight of animal born.
Revenue from consulting services represents amounts charged for professional services provided during the year including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax.
Services provided but not yet billed are recognised as revenue based on a fair value assessment of the work delivered and a contractual right to receive payment.
Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, nothing is recognised until the contingent event crystallises.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised directly in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance costs Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the income statement as they accrue.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established.
Finance costs that are directly attributable to construction of a qualifying asset, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity, or arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or to be recovered using the tax rates and the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payments In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of share awards and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period of each option.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Binomial valuation model.
The fair value of the awards granted is measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the estimated performance against non market related conditions and the number of share awards and options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements as set out in IFRS 1, the recognition and measurement criteria for share-based payments have been applied retrospectively for equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 and unvested at the applicable date.
No adjustments have been made for equity instruments granted prior to this date.
Backward Contents Forward Backward Contents Forward Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 53 Treasury shares Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company remain deducted from shareholders funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Retirement benefit obligations Defined contribution pension schemes A number of employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
Differences between contributions payable and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for some of its employees.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit schemes is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the Groups pension liabilities.
The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit market method.
Actuarial gains and losses including the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets and experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities are recognised in the period in which they occur directly into equity through the Group statement of changes in equity.
Pension costs are recognised on a systematic basis to match the costs of providing retirement benefits evenly over the service lives of the employees concerned.
Any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial value of liabilities is allocated over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
Actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 April 2005 are recognised in the period in which they occur directly into equity through the Group statement of changes in equity.
For one of the defined benefits schemes the Group operates, the Milk Pension Fund, the Group is a participating employer and takes a multi-employer exemption and only accounts for its share of the schemes assets and liabilities and its share of any orphan assets and liabilities.
The Group, together with the other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the schemes total obligations.
These obligations are disclosed as a contingent liability.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US dollar net assets of subsidiary entities.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in equity in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Where a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are recycled in the Group income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the Group income statement, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Backward Contents Forward Backward Contents Forward Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Overview 54 Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2010 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Net investment hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability of the net assets of an overseas subsidiary entity arising from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the functional currency of overseas subsidiary entities, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until such point as the investment to which it relates is disposed.
Net investment hedge accounting is applied solely in the Group financial statements.
New standards and interpretations adopted In the current financial year, the Group has adopted International Accounting Standard 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised 2007 and International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business Combinations revised 2008.
IAS 1 revised requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
As a result, a condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity has been included in the primary statements, showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented.
The adoption of IFRS 3 revised has not changed any previously reported figures.
Five interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC are effective for the current financial year.
These are: IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, IFRIC 15 Agreements for the construction of real estate and IFRIC 16 Hedges of net investment in a foreign operation, IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners and IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers.
The adoption of these IFRICs has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which have been endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective for the year ended 30 June 2010, and have not been applied in preparing these Group financial statements: IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments will become mandatory for the Groups 2011 financial statements.
The adoption of this IFRIC is not expected to have any material impact on the Group financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 7, IAS 17, IAS 24, IAS 32, IAS 36, IFRS 2, IFRS 5, and the omnibus of other minor improvements, effective for the year ended 30 June 2011.
The Group is assessing the impact of these amendments.
Significant areas of judgement and determination of fair values Management consider the critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement to be the following: Determination of the fair value of biological assets The determination of the fair values of bovine and porcine biological assets requires the use of significant judgement and assumptions including an estimation of future cash flows, use of appropriate discount rate in order to calculate present value, forecast sales volumes, proportion to slaughter and the length of lives of animals.
Fair value of assets and liabilities on business combinations The Groups accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to determine the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with the fair value of any consideration in excess of this amount representing goodwill.
In determining the fair values of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the use of significant judgement and assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows and unprovided liabilities and commitments, particularly to tax, are often involved.
The determination of the useful life of intangible assets, particularly on those arising on acquisition, involves the exercise of management judgement.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets Determining whether goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are impaired requires a consideration of any specific impairment indicators and an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill, intangible and tangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and the appropriate discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Recognition of deferred tax assets In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, the Directors make estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
In recognising deferred tax assets and liabilities management also makes judgements about likely future taxable profits.
When the final outcome of such matters, including the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses, is different, or expected to be different, from previous assessments by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made.

The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segments is as follows: 2010 2009 2008 m m m North America 34.1 30.2 25.3 Latin America 15.9 14.2 13.6 Europe 11.1 11.2 11.0 Far East 7.3 6.9 6.5 68.4 62.5 56.4 Goodwill has been restated see note 2.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations of both cash-generating units are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices, and direct costs.
Management have estimated the discount rate using the weighted average cost of capital of the business, changes in selling prices and direct costs, which are based on past experience and expectations of future change in the market, being risk adjusted for developing markets where appropriate.
The Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial and strategic budgets approved by management for the next three years, and extrapolates cash flows using estimated growth rates beyond this period.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: A growth rate of 4.0% 2009: 4.0%, 2008: 3.0% has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget and strategic plan period.
A post tax discount rate of 8.0% 2009: 8.0%, 2008: 9.2% has been applied to cash flow projections, which equates to a pre tax rate of approximately 11.4% 2009: 11.4%, 2008: 13.1%.

Biological assets continued Bovine biological assets include 1.9m 2009: 3.0m, 2008: 2.8m representing the fair value of bulls owned by third parties but managed by the Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties and are therefore treated as assets held under finance leases.
There are no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes during the year.
The current market determined pre-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull semen is the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets.
Inventories of such semen are shown as biological asset harvest in note 22.
Porcine biological assets include 32.4m 2009: 36.7m, 2008: 36.3m relating to the fair value of the retained interest in the genetics in respect of animals transferred to customers under royalty contracts.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 2.1m 2009: 3.3m, 2008: 2.6m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 12.0m 2009: 10.4m, 2008: 11.8m due to the uncertainty over the availability of future taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities totalling 3.6m 2009: 2.8m, 2008: 3.9m have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries.
No provision is required since the Group is in a position to control the timing and reversal of these differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset above to the extent that they arise in the same tax jurisdiction.

These risks include market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board of Directors regularly.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.
Financial risk The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed through its activities are risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods in foreign currency and on the purchase of supplies in foreign currencies: interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates: and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Any exposures to exchange rate fluctuations which arise are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 m m m m m m US Dollar including leases 42.0 45.1 34.5 0.6 2.8 3.7 EURO 9.8 10.2 2.6 2.8 Australian Dollar 6.3 Backward Contents Forward Backward Contents Forward Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Overview 72 Genus plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2010 27.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to movement in the US Dollar and the Euro exchange rates.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of a significant change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the Sterling weakens against the relevant currency.
For a strengthening of the Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.

The risk is managed centrally by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, using interest rate swap agreements.
Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, thereby ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, to minimize the adverse impact of fluctuations in interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of a significant change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 30 June 2010 would decrease increase by 0.2m 2009: decrease increase by 0.3m.
This small impact is attributable to the Groups high level of fixed rate borrowing.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3 month LIBOR or 1 month LIBOR.
The Group settles the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are regularly monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
