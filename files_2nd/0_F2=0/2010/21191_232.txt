258 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 40 Liability for investment contracts This note analyses our investment contract liabilities by type of product and describes how we calculate these liabilities and what assumptions we have used.
a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts at 31 December comprised: 2010 2009 m m Long-term business Participating contracts 69,482 66,559 Non-participating contracts at fair value 46,124 41,289 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 2,181 2,167 48,305 43,456 Total 117,787 110,015 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 39.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated distributable surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 41.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Of the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, 44,631 million are unit linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis.
These contracts are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.
For unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 27 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 51.
In the United States, funding agreements consist of one to ten year fixed rate contracts.
These contracts may not be cancelled by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement, but may, subject to a call premium, be terminated by Aviva at any time.
Aviva issued no new funding agreements in 2010.
The weighted average interest rates for fixed-rate and floating-rate funding agreements as at 31 December 2010 were 4.758% and 0.434% respectively.
Funding agreements issued before 2008 are measured at fair value equal to the present value of contractual cash flows and, for business issued since 2008, are measured at amortised cost.
Most funding agreements are fully collateralised and therefore their fair values are not adjusted for own credit risk.
Funding agreements carried at fair value total 1.0 billion and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.
Financial statements IFRS 259 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 40 Liability for investment contracts continued c Movements in the year The following movements have occurred in the year: i Participating investment contracts 2010 2009 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 66,559 65,278 Provisions in respect of new business 6,169 5,973 Expected change in existing business provisions 2,400 1,256 Variance between actual and expected experience 845 2,469 Impact of operating assumption changes 36 49 Impact of economic assumption changes 240 57 Other movements 65 1,316 Change in liability recognised as an expense 4,825 5,764 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 246 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,918 4,256 Other movements 16 19 Carrying amount at 31 December 69,482 66,559 The variance between actual and expected experience of 0.8 billion was primarily driven by favourable movements in investment markets in 2010, which had a direct or indirect impact on liability values.
Equity markets increased, government bond yields fell in major markets and credit spreads on corporate bonds were broadly unchanged.
For many types of long-term business, including unitlinked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
Minor variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality and other demographic factors.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of participating investment contract liabilities.
The 0.8 billion variance between actual and expected experience is not a change in assumptions.
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
ii Non-participating investment contracts 2010 2009 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 43,456 42,281 Provisions in respect of new business 4,096 3,045 Expected change in existing business provisions 2,145 1,847 Variance between actual and expected experience 1,276 2,495 Impact of operating assumption changes 20 107 Impact of economic assumption changes 3 4 Other movements 53 370 Change in liability 3,303 4,174 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 1,903 1,596 Foreign exchange rate movements 357 1,403 Carrying amount at 31 December 48,305 43,456 The variance between actual and expected experience of 1.3 billion was primarily driven by favourable movements in investment markets in 2010, which had a direct or indirect impact on liability values.
For unit-linked investment contracts, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of non-participating investment contract liabilities.
The 1.3 billion variance between actual and expected experience is not a change in assumptions.
The impact of assumption changes on profit are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, which combines participating and non-participating investment contracts together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
