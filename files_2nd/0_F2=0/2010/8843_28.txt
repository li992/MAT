com 63 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 Accounting Policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value through the income statement.
Significant accounting policies The Groups significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements are the result of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Groups subsidiary undertakings from the date of acquisition or up until the date of disposal as appropriate.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies and generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The Groups interests in joint ventures are accounted for using proportional consolidation.
Under this method the Group includes its share of each joint ventures income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions between Group subsidiaries are eliminated and transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture.
All Group companies apply the Groups accounting policies and prepare financial statements to 31 December.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year.
These estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions and actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are addressed below.
a Impairment of goodwill The Group carries out impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.
In addition, the Group carries out an annual impairment review.
An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than the carrying amount.
The impairment tests are carried out by CGU Cash Generating Unit and reflect the latest Group budgets.
The budgets are based on various assumptions relating to the Groups businesses including oil price, gas price, rig count, resource utilisation, foreign exchange rates, contract awards and contract margins.
b Revenue recognition Revenue on lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed-price long-term service agreements is recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs.
Use of the percentage of completion method requires the use of estimates in assessing the stage of completion reached.
c Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Functional currency The Groups earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the principal functional currency is the US dollar, being the most representative currency of the Group.
The Groups financial statements are therefore prepared in US dollars.
The following exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts: 2010 2009 Average rate 1 $ 1.5459 1.5679 Closing rate 1 $ 1.5657 1.6149 64 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 Accounting Policies continued Foreign currencies Income statements of entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange for the period and assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of net assets in such entities held at the beginning of the year, together with those differences resulting from the restatement of profits and losses from average to year end rates, are taken to the currency translation reserve.
In each individual entity, transactions in overseas currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Where more than one exchange rate is available, the appropriate rate at which assets can be readily realised and liabilities can be extinguished is used.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Where an entitys functional currency is in a hyperinflationary economy, the income statement and balance sheet of that entity will be translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the reporting date where the impact of the change in exchange rate due to hyperinflation is material to the Group.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate ruling on the date it was raised.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue from services is recognised as the services are rendered, including where they are based on contractual rates per man hour in respect of multi-year service contracts.
Incentive performance revenue is recognised upon completion of agreed objectives.
Revenue from product sales is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally upon delivery of products and customer acceptance, if any.
Where revenue relates to a multi-element contract, then each element of the contract is accounted for separately.
Revenue is stated net of sales taxes such as VAT and discounts.
Revenue on lump-sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed price long-term service agreements is recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs.
An estimate of the profit attributable to work completed is recognised once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably.
Expected losses are recognised in full as soon as losses are probable.
The net amount of costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less the sum of recognised losses and progress billings is disclosed as trade receivables trade payables.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include gains and losses on disposal of investments, write downs or impairments of assets including goodwill, restructuring costs or provisions, litigation settlements, acquisition costs and one-off gains and losses arising from currency devaluations.
Finance expense income Interest income and expense is recorded in the income statement in the period to which it relates.
Arrangement fees in respect of the Groups borrowing facilities are amortised over the period to which the facility relates.
Interest relating to the discounting of deferred consideration liabilities is recorded as finance expense.

com 65 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 Accounting Policies continued Dividends Dividends to the Groups shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.
Goodwill The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for acquisitions.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Acquisition costs relating to business combinations prior to 31 December 2009 were treated as part of the cost of acquisition and capitalised as goodwill.
In accordance with IFRS 3 revised acquisition costs relating to business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010 are expensed in the income statement.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future economic benefits attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately identifiable and there is control over the use of the asset.
Where the Group acquires a business, other intangible assets such as customer contracts are identified and evaluated to determine the carrying value on the acquisition balance sheet.
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Computer software 3 5 years Other intangible assets 1 10 years Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment PP&E is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
No depreciation is charged with respect to freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
Transfers from PP&E to current assets are undertaken at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 25 50 years Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 3 10 years When estimating the useful life of an asset group, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the durability of the assets, the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used and the expected rate of technological developments.
Impairment The Group performs impairment reviews in respect of PP&E and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In addition, the Group carries out annual impairment reviews in respect of goodwill.
An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit CGU.
The CGUs are aligned to the structure the Group uses to manage its business.
Cash flows are discounted in determining the value in use.
66 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 Accounting Policies continued Inventories Inventories, which include materials, work in progress and finished goods and goods for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Product-based companies determine cost by weighted average cost methods using standard costing to gather material, labour and overhead costs.
These costs are adjusted, where appropriate, to correlate closely the standard costs to the actual costs incurred based on variance analysis.
Service-based companies inventories consist of spare parts and other consumables.
Serialised parts are costed using the specific identification method and other materials are generally costed using the first in, first out method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated selling expenses.
Allowance is made for obsolete and slow-moving items, based upon annual usage.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and other short-term bank deposits with maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts where there is a right of set-off.
Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities where there is no right of set-off.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The provision is determined by reference to previous experience of recoverability for receivables in each market in which the Group operates.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Deferred consideration Where it is probable that deferred consideration is payable on the acquisition of a business based on an earn out arrangement, an estimate of the amount payable is made at the date of acquisition and reviewed regularly thereafter, with any change in the estimated liability being reflected in the income statement.
Changes in the estimated liability in respect of acquisitions completed before 31 December 2009 are reflected in goodwill.
Where deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Taxation The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the profit reported in the income statement due to items that are not taxable or deductible in any period and also due to items that are taxable or deductible in a different period.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation on PP&E, tax losses carried forward and, in relation to acquisitions, the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired and their tax base.
Tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
com 67 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 Accounting Policies continued Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedge.
Where hedging is to be undertaken, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the inception of the transaction, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
The Group performs effectiveness testing on a quarterly basis.
a Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in administrative expenses in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the hedging reserve in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
c Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
d Derivatives that are not designated as hedges Certain derivatives, whilst providing effective economic hedges, are not designated as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of their estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of currency options is determined using market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are obtained from valuations provided by financial institutions.
The carrying values of trade receivables and payables approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Fair value measurements are classified using the following hierarchy:- a quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 b inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly market price or indirectly derived from prices Level 2 : and c inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data Level 3.
The Groups fair values of derivative financial instruments are measured using Level 2 techniques.
68 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 Accounting Policies continued Operating leases As lessee Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the period of lease.
As lessor Operating lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a number of defined contribution schemes.
The liability recognised in respect of the defined benefit scheme represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The assets of this scheme are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The defined benefit schemes assets are measured using market values.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit scheme expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in finance income expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit schemes net assets or net liabilities are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Provisions Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services still under warranty, including claims already received, based on past experience.
Other provisions are recognised where the Group is deemed to have a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
Where amounts provided are payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
com 69 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 Accounting Policies continued Share-based charges relating to employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes: i Share options granted under Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS are granted at market value.
A charge is booked to the income statement as an employee benefit expense for the fair value of share options expected to be exercised, accrued over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings.
The fair value is calculated using an option pricing model.
ii Share options granted under the Long-Term Retention Plan LTRP are granted at par value.
The charge to the income statement for LTRP shares is also calculated using an option pricing model and, as with ESOS grants, the fair value of the share options expected to be exercised is accrued over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is also taken to retained earnings.
iii The Group has a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for executive directors and certain senior executives.
Participants are awarded shares dependent on the achievement of performance targets.
The charge to the income statement for shares awarded under the LTIP is based on the fair value of those shares at the grant date, spread over the vesting period.
For those awards that have a market-related performance measure, the fair value of the market-related element is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Share capital John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are classified as equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability or charged to equity until they have been approved by shareholders.
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts, therefore they have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.
Shares acquired by and disposed of by the employee share trusts are recorded at cost.
The cost of shares held by the employee share trusts is deducted from equity.
Segmental reporting The Group has determined that its operating segments are based on management reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
As a result, the Groups operating segments are its three operating divisions, namely Engineering & Production Facilities, Well Support and Gas Turbine Services.
The Group reports central costs and its Gas Turbine Services business to be disposed separately within its management reports.
The CODM measures the operating performance of these segments using EBITA earnings before interest, tax and amortisation.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reports provided to the CODM who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Engineering & Production Facilities offers a wide range of engineering services to the upstream, subsea and pipelines, downstream and industrial, and clean energy sectors.
These include conceptual studies, engineering, project and construction management EPCM and control system upgrades.
It also offers life of field support to producing assets through brownfield engineering and modifications, production enhancement, operations management including UK dutyholder services, training, maintenance management and abandonment services.
Well Support provides solutions, products and services to enhance production rates and efficiency from oil and gas reservoirs.
Gas Turbine Services is an independent provider of services and solutions for clients in the power, oil and gas and renewable energy markets.
Aftermarket maintenance activities include facility operations and maintenance, repair and overhaul of gas, wind and steam turbines, pumps, compressors and other high-speed rotating equipment.
The Power Solutions business includes power plant engineering, procurement and construction and construction management services to the owners of power generation facilities.

The impairment tests were carried out on a CGU basis using the 2011-12 budgets.
Cash flows for 2013-15 are assumed to grow at a rate of 5% per annum and subsequent cash flows have been assumed to grow at 3% per annum for a further 15 years reflecting expected long-term growth rates in the countries in which the Group operates.
Details of other key assumptions used are included in critical accounting judgements and estimates in the accounting policies.
In total, a 20 year period has been used for the impairment tests reflecting the expected long-term growth in the market.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10%.

17 Financial instruments The Groups activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Groups Treasury policies.
Group Treasury, together with the Groups business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks.
The Groups Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Groups profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geopolitical uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
com 85 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 17 Financial instruments continued a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group has a number of subsidiary companies whose revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Group hedges part of its net investment in non US dollar subsidiaries by using foreign currency bank loans.
Other strategies, including the payment of dividends, are used to minimise the amount of net assets exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
Some of the sales of the Groups businesses are to customers in overseas locations.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures on sales at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts.
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
The Groups main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
Movements in the sterling US dollar rate impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
If the average sterling US dollar rate had been 10% higher or lower during 2010, post-tax profit for the year would have been $6.9m higher or lower 2009: $8.3m.
If the closing sterling US dollar rate was 10% higher or lower at 31 December 2010, exchange differences in equity would have been $18.3m 2009: $15.1m higher or lower respectively.
10% has been used in these calculations as it represents a reasonable possible change in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
ii Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups long-term policy is to maintain approximately 50% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 31 December 2010, 57% 2009: 77% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of A or better, where possible.
If average interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during 2010, post-tax profit for the year would have been $1.2m higher or lower respectively 2009: $1.4m.
1% has been used in this calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
iii Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
86 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2010 17 Financial instruments continued b Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
The Groups operations comprise three divisions Engineering & Production Facilities, Well Support and Gas Turbine Services each made up of a number of businesses.
Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses with support being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency.
Where required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Where a customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be obtained.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of trade receivables.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance.
There is significant management focus on receivables that are overdue.
A table showing trade receivables and receivable days by division is provided in note 12.
Receivable days calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric.
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of A or better where possible.
100% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2010 2009: 100% was held with such institutions.
c Liquidity risk With regard to liquidity, the Groups main priority is to ensure continuity of funding.
At 31 December 2010, 94% 2009: 99% of the Groups borrowing facilities excluding joint ventures were due to mature in more than one year.
Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
d Capital risk The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure.
The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by shareholders funds.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing EBITA by net interest expense.
Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2010 was 10.3 times 2009: 10.6 times.
The ratio of net debt to EBITDA at 31 December 2010 was 0.04 times 2009: 0.21 times.

These are the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the Long-Term Retention Plan LTRP and the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Details of each of the schemes are given in the Directors Remuneration Report and in note 21.
The charge in the Group income statement in 2010 for these schemes amounted to $16.7m 2009: $11.2m The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below: ESOS and LTRP At 31 December 2010 there were 1,138 employees 2009: 1,084 participating in these schemes.
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 15% and 20%.
The share price volatility used in the calculation of 35%-40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk-free rate of return of 1.6%-5.2% is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
A dividend yield of 1.0%-2.0% has been used in the calculations.
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS during the year was 1.16 2009: 0.65 to 0.87.
The fair value of options granted under the LTRP during the year ranged from 2.79 to 3.57 2009: 2.00 to 2.56.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options at 31 December 2010 is 5.5 years 2009: 5.3 years.
LTIP The share-based charge for the LTIP was calculated using a fair value of 4.12 for the first cycle, 1.81 for the second cycle and 3.01 for the third cycle.
The charge for market-related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award.

The weighted average share price for ESOS options exercised during the year was 4.03 2009: 2.96.
Options granted to directors under the executive share option scheme are subject to performance criteria as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
There are no performance criteria under this scheme for options granted to employees.
The basis of the scheme is that an overall bonus pool is calculated annually based on performance criteria that consider the growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share in the prior year.
There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of options under the LTRP.
1,658,000 LTRP options were granted during the year, 1,258,693 LTRP options were exercised during the year and 496,461 LTRP options lapsed during the year.
The weighted average share price for LTRP options exercised during the year was 3.87 2009: 2.96.
Further details on the LTRP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The Groups Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP has been in place since 2008.
Under this Scheme, the executive directors but not the Chairman and certain other senior executives are awarded shares dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the LTIP are EBITA, return on capital employed, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
The LTIP awards are in the form of shares and restricted shares.
20% of any award earned over the three-year performance cycle are deferred for a further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares.
At 31 December 2010, 5,582,738 shares were potentially issuable under these schemes.
Further details of the LTIP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.

The table above includes amounts relating to the acquisitions of Al-Hejailan Consultants AHC and SgurrEnergy made during the year.
The Group acquired 55% of the share capital of AHC and 51% of the share capital of SgurrEnergy.
The acquisitions are not considered to be material to the Group on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated in the table above.
The acquisitions during the year provide the Group with access to new markets and strengthen the Groups capabilities in certain areas.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Groups wider client base and use the Groups existing relationships to further grow and develop their businesses.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised by the Group on the acquisitions.

29 Retirement benefit liabilities One of the Groups pension schemes in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, is a defined benefit scheme, which is contracted out of the State Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2007 by a professionally qualified actuary.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2010 2009 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.30 5.40 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.30 3.40 Discount rate 5.40 5.80 Expected return on scheme assets 7.24 7.06 The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
The mortality assumptions used by the actuary take account of standard actuarial tables compiled from UK-wide statistics relating to occupational pension schemes.
At 31 December 2010 the actuary has used the PXA00 mortality table with long cohort projections and a 1% underpin in the rate of future improvements in mortality.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2010 2009 $m $m 188.3 Present value of funded obligations 174.4 Fair value of scheme assets 155.0 140.1 Net liabilities 33.3 34.3 Energy Supporting Energy Financial statements go online at www.
