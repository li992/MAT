The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2002, by the end of 2010 5,814 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 6,250 million was re-estimated to be 6,035 million at 31 December 2010.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its general insurance and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables and movements table c iv above.
However, in order to maintain overall reserve adequacy, the Group establishes strong reserves in respect of the current accident year 2010 where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
Releases from prior accident year reserves are also due to an improvement in the estimated cost of claims.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2009 were: 230 million from the UK, including group reinsurance business, mainly due to an improved view of group reinsurance liabilities, and favourable development on personal and commercial motor claims, and commercial property and commercial liability large claims.
237 million from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal motor and commercial property, especially in respect of large claims.
79 million from Canada mainly due to favourable experience on motor and personal property.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2010 were: 101 million from the UK, including group reinsurance business, mainly due to an improved view of group reinsurance liabilities, and favourable development on personal property claims, and commercial property and commercial liability large claims.
167 million from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal and commercial property.
44 million from Canada mainly due to favourable experience on motor and commercial liability.
