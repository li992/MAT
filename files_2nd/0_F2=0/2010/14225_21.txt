Goodwill arising on a number of historical acquisitions was then written off against this special reserve under the accounting convention at that time.
The balance on the special reserve was transferred into retained profits in 2009.
The share option reserve represents the cumulative share option charge under IFRS 2 less the value of any share options that have been exercised.
The hedging and translation reserve represents movements in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of movements in exchange rates which are taken directly to reserves as detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on pages 74 to 78.
A liability of 7.4m has been recognised in the year for the put element of options that exist to purchase the remaining non-controlling interests of the Group.
The accompanying Statement of Significant Accounting Policies and Notes to the Accounts are an integral part of this Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
