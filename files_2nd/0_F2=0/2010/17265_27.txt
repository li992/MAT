Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 July 2010 1.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts.
The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are in the areas set out below.
Allowance for doubtful accounts Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired.
Within each of the businesses assessment is made locally of the recoverability of accounts receivable based on a range of factors including the age of the receivable and the creditworthiness of the customer.
The provision is assessed monthly with a detailed formal review of balances and security being conducted at the full year and half year.
Determining the recoverability of an account involves estimation as to the likely financial condition of the customer and their ability to subsequently make payment.
If the Group is cautious as to the financial condition of the customer the Group may provide for accounts that are subsequently recovered.
Similarly if the Group is optimistic as to the financial condition of the customer the Group may not provide for an account that is subsequently determined to be irrecoverable.
Furthermore, while the Group has a large geographically dispersed customer base, a slowdown in the markets in which the Group operates may result in higher than expected uncollectible amounts and therefore higher or lower than anticipated charges for irrecoverable receivables.
The amount relating to continuing operations charged to the income statement in 2010 in respect of doubtful accounts represented 0.32 per cent of revenue 2009: 0.62 per cent.
Wolseley held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2010 amounting to 60 million 2009: 81 million.
Inventories For financial reporting purposes the Group evaluates its inventory to ensure it is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Provision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged inventories.
Damaged inventories are identified and written down through the inventory counting procedures conducted within each business.
Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories is assessed by each business as part of their ongoing financial reporting.
Obsolescence is assessed based on comparison of the level of inventory holding to the projected likely future sales.
Future sales are assessed based on historical experience, and adjusted where the manufacturer has indicated that it will no longer continue to manufacture the particular item.
To the extent that future events impact the saleability of inventory these provisions could vary significantly.
For example, changes in specifications or regulations may render inventory, previously considered to have a realisable value in excess of cost, obsolete and require such inventory to be fully written off.
The Group held allowances in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2010 amounting to 140 million 2009: 151 million.
Impairment of long-lived assets Wolseley periodically evaluates the net realisable value of long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments in associates, relying on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans and projected future cash flows.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual asset or asset group.
Estimates are used in deriving these cash flows and the discount rate.
As disclosed in notes 14, 15, 16 and 17, the Group has charged 402 million in respect of the impairment of long-lived assets during the year ended 31 July 2010 2009: 879 million.
The results of tests for impairment are sensitive to the assumptions made in the value in use calculations.
The Group has estimated the effect of increasing the discount rate by one percentage point, and of decreasing the trading margin for each asset group by half a percentage point in the final year of the cash flow forecast.
The additional impairment charges that would arise from applying either of these alternative assumptions to those cash-generating units impaired in the year is 109 million.
The impact on the Groups other cash-generating units of the alternative assumptions would be a charge of less than 2 per cent of the carrying amount of their goodwill and acquired intangible assets of 1,585 million at 31 July 2010.
Captive insurance The Group operates a captive insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited, which is registered and operational in the Isle of Man.
This company provides reinsurance exclusively to certain companies within the Group, principally to cover US casualty and global property damage risks.
Provision is made based on actuarial assessment of the liabilities arising from the insurance coverage provided.
The actuarial assessment of the reserve for future claims necessarily includes estimates as to the likely trend of future claims costs and estimates as to the emergence of further claims subsequent to the year end.
An actuarial review of claims is performed annually.
To the extent that actual claims differ from those projected the provisions could vary significantly.
At 31 July 2010, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was 55 million 2009: 57 million.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Consideration received from vendors The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates primarily upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels with many of these agreements applying to sales in a calendar year.
For certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made.
The Group accrues the receipt of vendor rebates as part of its cost of sales for products sold, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through to the end of the qualifying period.
Rebates are accrued for each reporting period with an extensive reassessment of the rebates earned being performed at the end of the financial year and half way through the financial year.
The Group has agreements with numerous and geographically dispersed suppliers, but a slow down in the markets in which the Group operates, or a significant change in the profile of products purchased may result in purchases for the remainder of the year differing significantly from those projected.
Consequently the rebate actually received may vary from that accrued in the financial statements.
Legal, environmental and other provisions The Group makes provisions for known and potential legal claims and environmental and other matters, including asbestos related litigation and product liability claims, where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute or matter.
In establishing such provisions the Group takes into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and considers the advice of its legal and other professional advisers.
The ultimate liability for potential legal claims and other matters may vary from the amounts provided and may be dependent upon the discovery of facts that are currently uncertain, the outcome of litigation proceedings and possible settlement negotiations.
There can, therefore, be no assurance that any losses that result from the final outcome of these matters will not exceed the amount of the provisions reported in the Groups financial statements.
At 31 July 2010 legal, environmental and other provisions amounted to 152 million 2009: 107 million.
Onerous lease provisions When the present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value of the rental payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall firstly against the carrying amount of the assets in the case of finance leases and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract for all leases.
Determining the amount of such provision requires estimating the future net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet.
To the extent that actual cash flows received differ from those estimated, the amount of provision recognised could differ materially.
At 31 July 2010, the provision for onerous leases was 88 million 2009: 124 million.
Impairment of construction loan receivables and foreclosed properties held for sale A provision for impairment of construction loan receivables is made when management estimates that the present value of future cash flows recoverable in respect of these receivables is less than the carrying amount.
Determining the amount of such provision requires estimating the amount and timing of such future cash flows, which requires an assessment of: x the financial condition of the debtor: x the ability of the debtor to meet contractual payments: and x in the event that the Group forecloses on the property on which the receivable is secured, the likely cost of enhancing the marketability of the property, the likely disposal proceeds, and the likely period for which the property will be held to before a sale can be achieved.
To the extent that actual amounts recovered differ from those estimated, the amount of provision recognised could differ materially.
At 31 July 2010, the provision for impairment of construction loans receivables was 36 million 2009: 39 million and the provision against foreclosed properties held for sale was 24 million 2009: 18 million.
Taxation Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and exposures.
Amounts accrued are based on managements interpretation of country-specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions are probable of being sustained.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of any potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
All such provisions are included in creditors due within one year.
Any recorded exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates, and are disclosed in note 32.
Wolseley plc 79 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2010 1.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the balance sheet and income statement.
The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate and life expectancy.
The Group has estimated the sensitivity of the financial statements to changes in these assumptions as follows: Increase decrease in liability 2010 Effect of a change in discount rate m Increase of 0.5% 107 Decrease of 0.5% 120 Effect of an increase in life expectancy Increase of one year 33 2.
Segmental analysis Wolseleys reportable segments, which are those reported to the Groups Executive Committee, are the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their performance.
All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products and building materials.
The UK segment, which was formerly named UK and Ireland, includes the results of the Irish business up to the date of disposal.
The Groups business is not highly seasonal but revenue and trading profit are normally somewhat higher in the second half.
The Groups customer base is highly diversified, with no individually significant customer.
The revenue, trading profit and operating loss profit of the Groups reportable segments are detailed in the following tables.

Since 6 May 2009 additional non-voting equity has been issued by Saturn such that as at 31 July 2010 the Group had a 44 per cent interest in its common equity.
The associate released certain restructuring provisions during the year.
The Groups share of the after tax credit to income of 11 million has been disclosed as an exceptional item 2009: net restructuring costs of 6 million.
In the year ended 31 July 2010, Saturn recorded revenue of 605 million and a loss after tax of 29 million.
In the period from 6 May 2009 to 31 July 2009 Saturn recorded revenue of 110 million and a loss after tax of 33 million.
b Impairment During the year ended 31 July 2010 Saturn continued to be loss making due to challenging conditions in its markets.
Consequently there is significant uncertainty as to whether the Group will receive dividends or other returns from its investment in the future and therefore the Group has fully impaired the carrying value of its investment at year end.

Loss earnings per share Basic loss per share from continuing and discontinued operations of 120.6 pence 2009: loss per share of 558.0 pence is calculated on the loss for the year attributable to shareholders of 340 million 2009: loss of 1,173 million on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Basic loss per share from continuing operations of 129.8 pence 2009: loss per share of 348.2 pence is calculated on the loss after tax from continuing operations of 366 million 2009: loss of 732 million on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by Employee Benefit Trusts, of 282 million 2009: 210 million.
As detailed in note 12 below, the Group believes that profit measures before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements.
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations, before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, has, therefore, been presented in the following table: Continuing operations 2010 2009 Before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 74.1p 95.6p Add back: exceptional items net of tax 102.1 p 170.3 p Add back: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles net of deferred tax 101.8 p 273.5 p Basic loss per share 129.8 p 348.2 p The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue to 283 million 2009: 211 million.
The diluted loss per share from continuing operations is also 129.8 pence 2009: loss per share of 348.2 pence.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is 73.9 pence 2009: 95.5 pence.
88 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 12.
Non-GAAP measures of performance Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
Exceptional items are material non-recurring items which are excluded from trading profit to enable a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying financial performance.
In addition, the current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition.
Operating profit includes only the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 where no amortisation or impairment of acquired intangibles was recognised, businesses that have developed organically where no intangibles are attributed and those businesses more recently acquired where amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is charged.
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Groups performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.
The Group uses trading profit and certain key performance indicators, calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.

Intangible assets goodwill continued All goodwill has arisen from business combinations.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to cash-generating units and groups of cash-generating units CGUs.
These are independent sources of income streams, and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level.
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts approved by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, trading margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience, reflecting the cyclicality of earnings, and expectations of future changes in the market.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five year period at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate for each market ranging from 1.4 per cent to 2.5 per cent, and discounted back to present value.
The discount rate assumptions use an estimate of the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.3 per cent, based on the five year historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates.
The pre-tax discount rate which ranges from 10 per cent to 12 per cent has been applied to the risk adjusted cash flows of each CGU.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 July 2010.
These impairment reviews have resulted in the recording of the following impairment charges.
Impairment charge Other acquired Pre-tax Long-term Goodwill intangibles Total discount growth CGU m m m rate used rate used Brandon Hire 38 12 50 11% 2.5% Encon 4242 11% 2.5% Electric Center 3 3 11% 2.5% UK segment 80 15 95 PBM 102102 11% 2.5% Brossette 819 11% 2.5% France segment 110 1 111 Woodcote 15217 12% 2.5% Nordic segment 15 2 17 Total 20518223 Market conditions have been more challenging than expected in France and a more gradual recovery in profit is now expected.
In addition the implementation of unfavourable supplier payment legislation has affected the level of working capital required to support the business.
As a result of reflecting these changed expectations in the value in use calculations of Brossette and PBM, all of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets relating to Brossette have been impaired and an impairment charge has been recorded against the goodwill relating to PBM.
The carrying value of the remaining goodwill and other acquired intangibles relating to PBM was 144 million at 31 July 2010.
The UK segment has continued to experience challenging market conditions and this has been reflected in reduced expectations in its value in use calculations for certain businesses.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles relating to the Brandon Hire and Electric Center businesses have been fully impaired.
The carrying value of the remaining goodwill and other acquired intangibles relating to the Encon business was 50 million at 31 July 2010.
The Woodcote business in the Nordic segment has continued to perform below expectations as a result of difficult market conditions and its long-term outlook has been downgraded.
Consequently its goodwill and other acquired intangibles have been fully impaired.

In December 2009 the Board determined that the branch deployment of the supply chain management part of the Groups Business Change Programme, that was intended to commence in 2010, would be deferred for a period of at least 24 months after which time the future migration plan would be reconsidered.
Given the uncertainty surrounding future deployment, the Board currently believes that it cannot conclude that it is probable that deployment will recommence and therefore certain software assets under development, held at the Group centre, with a book value of 138 million have been impaired.
Total software assets relating to the Groups Business Change Programme now have a book value of 26 million.
In addition the Group has provided for a further 32 million of costs relating to contractual and constructive obligations which have been classified as an exceptional item see note 4.
More details on the impairment charge for the year in respect of trade names and brands and customer relationships is provided in note 14.

There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 48 million 2009: 96 million that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The tax losses in Italy of 21 million and the Czech Republic of 15 million expire after five years.
The remaining tax losses of 12 million can be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries.
However, tax may arise on 503 million 2009: 567 million of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the associated temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Accordingly, management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.

Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Groups bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on LIBOR.
Interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest payable on notional principal of 300 million 2009: 900 million were designated and effective as cash flow hedges for the first half of the year, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity.
The contracts expire between August 2010 and August 2011 2009: August 2009 and August 2011, and the fixed interest rates range between 4.57 per cent and 4.59 per cent 2009: 2.59 per cent and 4.59 per cent.

Valuation gains have been credited to profit and loss.
As the cash flows which were the subject of the hedge relationship are still forecast to occur, valuation losses deferred in equity are being recycled over the duration of the previous hedge relationship.

Interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest receivable on notional principal of $729 million 2009: $729 million are designated as hedges of the fair values of these borrowings.
The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective as a hedge, and a proportion that is ineffective: both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings see note 6.
The contracts expire between November 2012 and November 2020 and the fixed interest rates range between 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent 2009: 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent.

These loans are generally settled when completed homes are sold, rather than at a fixed term.
The average age since origination is 15 months 2009: 20 months.
As the contractual maturity of these loans, which did not exceed 12 months from the reporting date, was set at origination to correspond to the normal operating cycle of the construction business, and the Group normally expects to realise the loans within their contractual maturity, these loans have all been classified as current assets.
As at 31 July 2010, the effective rate of interest on construction loans was 7 per cent 2009: 8 per cent.
Wolseley plc 99 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2010 24.
Construction loans continued Movements in the provision for impairment of construction loan receivables are as follows: 2010 2009 m m At 1 August 39 18 Charge for the year before exceptional items 13 Charge for the year exceptional 20 25 Utilised in the year 26 17 Exchange rate adjustment 3 At 31 July 36 39 In light of the ongoing weak conditions in the credit markets and the poor performance of the business, the Group now plans to accelerate its exit from the business and accordingly has recorded an exceptional charge of 24 million.
This consists of the exceptional charge of 20 million for impairment of construction loan receivables shown above and an exceptional charge of 4 million to write down assets held for sale to their recoverable amount.
Construction loan receivables on which payments are delinquent are subject to foreclosure of the property on which the loan is secured, such that the disposal proceeds of the property can be applied in settlement of the outstanding liability.
After foreclosure, the balance of receivables net of provisions for impairment is transferred to assets held for sale.
Provisions for impairments of receivables comprise: x a provision for amounts that have been individually determined not to be collectable in full, because of known financial difficulties of the debtor or evidence of default or delinquency in payment, amounting to 12 million at 31 July 2010 2009: 13 million : and x a provision based on historic experience of the shortfall of disposal proceeds of foreclosed properties to the outstanding balance due, amounting to 24 million at 31 July 2010 2009: 26 million.
Management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.
Construction loan receivables can be aged with respect to the payment terms specified in the terms and conditions established with customers as follows: 2010 2009 m m Amounts not yet due 65 107 Past due not more than one month 12 20 Past due more than one month and less than three months 5 10 Past due more than three months 22 52 Amounts individually determined to be impaired 12 13 116 202 Construction loan receivables at 31 July 2010 includes 27 million in respect of loans on which foreclosure proceedings have been started 2009: 54 million.
The fair value of collateral held in respect of construction loans receivable is believed to be sufficient to cover the net amount of construction loans receivable.
During the year ended 31 July 2010 disposal proceeds of 41 million 2009: 36 million were realised from the sale of foreclosed properties, in respect of loans with a principal value of 70 million before provisions 2009: 46 million.

With effect from 1 August 2009, the Group has adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for such financial instruments.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: x Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : x Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : x Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market such as over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.
104 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 29.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The Groups other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value.
Because current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear floating rate interest, their fair values approximate to book values.
The book values and fair values of categories including non-current assets and liabilities can be compared as follows: 2010 2010 2009 2009 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Trade and other receivables, excluding 1,868 1,868 prepayments and accrued income 1,783 1,782 Trade and other payables, excluding accruals, 2,248 2,248 deferred income and other tax and social security 2,325 2,325 Bank loans 238 238 1,056 1,056 Senior unsecured notes 675 678 606 613 Finance lease obligations 75 75 71 71 c Financial risk management The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the financial instruments which fund them.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial periods ended 31 July 2009 and 31 July 2010.
By the nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses.
There has been no change since the year end in the major financial risks faced by the Group.
The Treasury Committee of the Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
When the Group enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts, the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital risk management The Groups sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions.
To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure to current and forecast trading, the Groups principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt, including receivables factoring facilities, to EBITDA.
The Groups target is to keep this ratio within a range of 1 to 2, consistent with an investment grade credit rating.
The Groups main borrowing facilities contain financial covenants limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to 3.5:1, and requiring the ratio of EBITDA to net interest to exceed 4.0.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amounts of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and bolt-on acquisitions for the following financial year with an additional contingent safety margin.
Large acquisitions are funded shortly before the acquisition is made.
As at 31 July 2010, the Group had undrawn centrally managed facilities maturing as follows: 31 July 2010 31 July 2009 m m Less than one year 100 100 Between one and two years 1,394 Between two and three years 188 683 Between three and four years 832 43 Between four and five years 852 Total 2,514 1,678 At 31 July 2010, the Group had 274 million 2009: 168 million drawn and 96 million 2009: 169 million undrawn on receivables factoring facilities.
Wolseley plc 105 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2010 29.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outflows including interest payable in respect of its bank and construction loan borrowings on an undiscounted basis.
The principal assumptions are that floating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash flows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
These cash flows can be analysed by maturity as follows: Construction Interest rate loan Interest on and currency Debt borrowings debt swaps Total As at 31 July 2010 m m m m m Due in less than one year 136 80 41 5 262 Due in one to two years 1 38 3 42 Due in two to three years 53 36 89 Due in three to four years 34 24 58 Due in four to five years 73 24 97 Due in over five years 549 79 628 Total 846 80 242 8 1,176 Construction Interest rate loan Interest on and currency Debt borrowings debt swaps Total As at 31 July 2009 m m m m m Due in less than one year 5 163 61 29 258 Due in one to two years 12556 6 187 Due in two to three years 830 33 1 864 Due in three to four years 49 30 79 Due in four to five years 1 29 30 Due in over five years 614 188 802 Total 1,624163397 36 2,220 Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 39 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars and 23 per cent in euros.
The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposure.
However, those that do arise are generally hedged with either forward contracts or currency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect.
Most of the foreign currency earnings generated by the Groups overseas operations are reinvested in the business to fund growth in those territories.
The Groups policy is to adjust the currencies in which its debt is denominated to match the currencies in which its trading profit is generated, as this hedges the ratio of net debt to EBITDA in the covenant calculation.
Net debt at 31 July 2010 by currency was as follows: Cash, overdrafts Currency Interest Finance lease and bank bought sold rate swaps obligations loans forward Total As at 31 July 2010 m m m m m Sterling 2 249 104 143 US dollars 71 7 416 75 427 Euros, Danish kroner and Swedish kronor 8 41 105 141 13 Other 25 67 43 49 Total 63 75 339 5 346 106 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 29.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Net debt at 31 July 2009 by currency was as follows: Cash, Currency Trading Interest Finance lease overdrafts and bought sold investment rate swaps obligations bank loans forward Total As at 31 July 2009 m m m m m m Sterling 4 218 251 37 US dollars 38 11 457 230 660 Euros, Danish kroner and Swedish kronor 155 25 49 855 596 178 Other 7 30 107 84 Total 15513 71 1,064 8 959 Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the Five year summary on page 137.
The net effect of currency translation was to increase revenue by 223 million 1.5 per cent 2009: 2,439 million, or 16.5 per cent and to increase trading profit by 5 million 1.1 per cent 2009: 147 million, or 18.7 per cent.
These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars and Euros as follows: 2010 2009 Weakening Weakening of sterling of sterling US dollars 0.1% 27.3% Euros 1.8% 16.2% Interest rate risk To manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Groups policy is that at least 20 per cent of bank borrowings required during the next two years should be at fixed rates.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates which reset at least every 12 months, which are regarded as floating rates, and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at both Treasury Committee and Board meetings.
The Treasury Committee gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are exposed to both fair value interest rate risk fixed rate borrowings and cash flow interest rate risk floating rate borrowings.
The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt at 31 July 2010 and 31 July 2009, after including the effect of interest rate swaps, is set out in the following tables.
As at 31 July 2010 currency Floating Fixed Total Sterling 145 2 143 US dollars 290 137 427 Euros, Danish kroner and Swedish kronor 286 299 13 Other currencies 24 25 49 Total 117 463 346 As at 31 July 2009 currency Floating Fixed Total Sterling 33 4 37 US dollars 479 181 660 Euros, Danish kroner and Swedish kronor 493 671 178 Other currencies 77 7 84 Total 96 863 959 Fixed rate borrowings at 31 July 2010 carried a weighted average interest rate of 4.6 per cent fixed for a weighted average duration of 1.6 years 31 July 2009: 4.2 per cent for 1.4 years.
Floating rate borrowings at 31 July 2010 carried a weighted average interest rate of 1.5 per cent 31 July 2009: 1.8 per cent.
Credit risk Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding balances.
The Groups construction loan business also provides loans to finance the construction of properties.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding loan balances.
At 31 July 2010 the maximum exposure to credit risk was 1,863 million 2009: 2,031 million of which 80 million 2009: 163 million is secured against homes under construction or completed homes awaiting sale.
Wolseley plc 107 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2010 29.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables.
Significant outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis.
In many cases, protection is provided through lien rights on projects, or through credit insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases field-based.
Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
The Groups construction loans are secured on the related properties and are managed by a dedicated lending team within that business.
Policies are also applied to provide further protection and KPIs are monitored regularly by management outside the business.
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts such as interest rate swaps which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions.
These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of 744 million 2009: 850 million.
This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, all of which have credit ratings equivalent to Standard & Poors A or higher.
In exceptional circumstances the Treasury Committee will allow deposits with relationship banks with other investment grade ratings, subject to close monitoring of the exposure.
The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly.
Market price risk The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
On the basis of the Groups analysis, it is estimated that the maximum effect of a rise of one percentage point in the principal interest rates on the Groups continuing businesses would result in a credit to the income statement of 1 million 2009: charge of 4 million, arising from the Groups net exposure to floating rate deposits at 31 July 2010, and have no effect on equity 2009: charge of 4 million, resulting from changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
Similarly, it is estimated that a weakening of sterling by 10 per cent against all the currencies in which the Group does business would result in a charge to the income statement of 1 million 2009: charge of 2 million arising from derivatives held at fair value through profit and loss, and a charge to equity of 62 million 2009: 122 million, arising from the translation of borrowings denominated in foreign currency and designated as net investment hedges.
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Groups exposure to any of the macro-economic variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.

The environmental and legal provision includes the estimated liability for asbestos litigation on a discounted basis using a longterm discount rate of 3.7 per cent 2009: 4.3 per cent.
This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2010 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
The Group has insurance that it currently believes is sufficient cover for the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables.
Based on current estimates, the amount of performing insurance cover significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
There were 249 claims outstanding at 31 July 2010 31 July 2009: 273.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs, future lease rentals on closed branches and asset write-downs.
In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years.
Other provisions include the Groups best estimate of the cost of potential product and service warranty claims arising in Stock Building Supply Holdings LLC Stock before its disposal on 6 May 2009, separation costs relating to the disposal of Stock and contractual and constructive obligations relating to the Business Change Programme note 15.
Other provisions also include rental commitments on vacant properties other than those arising from restructuring actions, dilapidations on leased properties and warranties.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately three years.

Retirement benefit obligations i Description of plans United Kingdom The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes retirement benefits are funded by a salary sacrifice arrangement from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies.
Employees salary sacrifice either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of benefits accruing.
The Group contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
This scheme was closed to new entrants in 2009.
A defined contribution scheme is also operated and contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
In the year ended 31 July 2010 the cost of defined contribution plans charged to the income statement was 1 million 2009: 1 million.
Outside the United Kingdom North America The principal schemes operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
Contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
In the year ended 31 July 2010 the cost of defined contribution plans of continuing operations charged to the income statement was 14 million 2009: 21 million.
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit schemes in the United States.
In Canada, a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated.
One of the US schemes and the Canadian scheme are funded: two plans are closed to new entrants.
The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme.
The remaining schemes provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
Europe Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated.
Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
In the year ended 31 July 2010 the cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was 20 million 2009: 21 million.
Post-retirement healthcare There are no material obligations to provide post-retirement healthcare benefits.
The Group expects to contribute 54 million to the UK defined benefit schemes in the year ending 31 July 2011, including an additional 25 million arising as a result of the recently completed funding valuations.
The Group expects to contribute 11 million to the non-UK defined benefit schemes.

The expected equity returns can be considered as a risk free rate of return determined by reference to government bond rates in the countries in which the plans are based plus a risk premium to reflect the additional risks associated with equities.
For the UK scheme the expected return implies a premium of 2.9 per cent per year as at 31 July 2010 2009: 3.2 per cent over the expected return from government bonds.
For the principal overseas schemes in USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar approach was adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups investment strategy for its funded post-employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, the trustees of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK scheme, the policy is to invest approximately 75 per cent of the assets in equities and 25 per cent in other asset classes, principally bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group.
For the overseas schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.

No shares were purchased by the trusts during the year.
The market value of the 1,948,919 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts at 31 July 2010, which have a nominal value of 0.2 million, was 28 million 2009: 26 million.
During the year, 29,118 shares were allocated from the Employee Benefit Trusts to employees under the Restricted Share Plan.
Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds.

Share-based payments The Group operates six share option plans: the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 collectively, the Executive Option Schemes : the Wolseley Employees Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1981 and the Wolseley European Sharesave Plan 2001 collectively, the Employees Savings Option Schemes : and the Wolseley Employee Share Purchase Plan 2001 the ESPP.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years.
Awards granted under the Employee Savings Option Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven years.
Awards granted under the ESPP vest over a one-year period.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan RSP for senior executives.
Under the LTIS, executives are awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over the next three years relative to that of a number of comparator companies.
The vesting period is three years.
The maximum award under the LTIS is determined at grant date and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market performance condition.
Under the RSP, executives excluding Directors are granted free shares.
The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures other than retained employment.
Following the capital reorganisation and share issue which was completed during April 2009, appropriate adjustments were made to reflect the dilutive effect of both transactions on outstanding awards.
The calculations were made in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs HMRC recommendations.
Such calculations were reviewed by the Companys auditors, who performed specific procedures to recalculate the adjustments made to outstanding awards, on the basis that the Directors of the Company deemed the adjustments to be fair and reasonable.
After adjustments had been made to outstanding awards to reflect the capital reorganisation, a further adjustment was made using the theoretical ex-rights price calculation TERP as agreed with HMRC.
All outstanding awards made under the Companys share plans were multiplied by a TERP factor of 2.398177677 and the respective option prices and market prices at allocation were multiplied by a factor of 0.416983283.
These formulae were designed to minimise the effect of the capital reorganisation and the share issue upon outstanding awards and, subject to roundings, ensured that the overall value of outstanding awards was the same after adjustment.

Accounting standards and interpretations that are not yet effective Certain new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2010 or later periods, but which the Group has not early adopted.
The new standards which are expected to be relevant to the Groups operations are as follows: IAS 24 revised Related party disclosures applicable from 1 August 2011 This revision simplifies the definition of a related party, clarifying its intended meaning and eliminating inconsistencies from the definition, and provides a partial exemption from the disclosure requirements for government-related entities.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the Groups future financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments classification and measurement applicable from 1 August 2013 The part of this standard so far issued is the first stage in a comprehensive revision of the accounting for financial instruments.
This standard requires all financial assets to be classified on the basis of the entitys business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset: to be initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit and loss, particular transaction costs: and to be subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value.
