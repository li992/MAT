When exercised, holders receive a number of shares calculated by reference to the increase in the market price at the time of exercise over the option price as shown in the table above.
Any remaining share appreciation rights are shown in the table above as lapsed.
Information relating to all option schemes The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 487.67 pence 2009: 326.22 pence.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.5 years 2009: 4.8 years for executive and management options and 1.2 years 2009: 1.5 years for employee schemes.
In the year, options were granted on 13 May 2010 under the terms of the Option Plan 2010.
The estimated fair value of options granted on this date was 159.60 pence.
In 2009, options were granted on 31 March 2009 and 30 September 2009.
The estimated fair value of these options was 76.40 pence and 100.62 pence respectively.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
Fair values for options granted under employee savings-related schemes are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The expected volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted under executive schemes: Assumptions options 2010 2009 Expected volatility 37.0% 35.1% Risk free interest rate 2.8% 2.6% Dividend yield 2.5% 3.7% Expected life 6.0 years 6.0 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 559.00p 321.69p Weighted average option exercise price 557.50p 321.27p Vesting of options awarded from October 2005 onwards depends on the achievement of the Group Free Cash Flow GFCF target.
For options granted after 30 September 2006, 25% of the awards will vest if the threshold GFCF target is met and 100% of the awards will vest if the maximum GFCF target is met.
Awards vest on a straight-line basis for GFCF between these two points.

The comparator group used for the award for the year commencing 1 October 2006 comprised all companies within the FTSE 100 Index, whereas, for subsequent years, only non-financial companies have been included.
This performance condition is treated as a market-based condition for valuation purposes and an assessment of the vesting probability is built into the grant date fair value calculations.
This assessment was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The remaining 50% of LTIP awards made from 1 October 2005 onwards depends on the achievement of the GFCF target.
25% of that part of the award will vest if the threshold GFCF target is met and 100% of that part of the award will vest if the maximum GFCF target is met.
Awards vest on a straight-line basis between these two points.

The GFCF performance targets relating to LTIP awards made in the years commencing 1 October 2005 and 2006 were met in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to the participants.
The element of awards made in the years commencing 1 October 2005 and 1 October 2006 dependent upon TSR performance targets also vested in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to participants as the Companys TSR performance was within the top quartile of the comparator group.
The weighted average share price at the date of release for LTIP awards released during 2010 was 433.79 pence 2009: 309.93 pence.
