She recently developed neuropathy - she cant feel wounds on her feet which led to serious ulceration in her left foot.
She was bed bound and there was no sign of improvement.
Her lead podiatrist suggested the use of RENASYS GO, our Negative Pressure Wound Therapy treatment for the homecare setting.
The product quickened the healing process and enabled Linda to go home after a couple of days and use the pump from there.
She really appreciated the little things it helped with, like being allowed to take a bath or shower, that other people take for granted.
