The Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the company.
In order to manage the risk of foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, the company has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps whereby fixed floating US dollar interest is swapped for fixed sterling interest.
The swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings which they hedge and are considered to be effective.
Covenants on these Notes include a term which states that Britvic plc must offer to repay the Notes should a change in control of the group occur which results in a downwards movement in the credit rating as defined in the Note purchase agreement.
