OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT 2010 83 4 Pension schemes The UK defined benefit scheme is described in note 7 to the Group accounts.
The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2007 and has been updated to 31 March 2010 by a qualified independent actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The deficit on the UK scheme is included within the balance sheet of RS Components Ltd, a subsidiary of Electrocomponents plc, as it is this company which employs the majority of the scheme members.
As allowed by FRS 17, the deficit has not been split between Electrocomponents plc and RS Components Ltd as it is not possible to do so on a consistent and reasonable basis.
This disclosure therefore relates to the UK pension scheme rather than just the Electrocomponents plc portion of it.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the liabilities of the scheme were: 2010 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.40% 6.25% 5.90% Rate of increase in salaries 2.55% 2.55% 3.80% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.30% 3.00% 3.60% Inflation assumption 3.40% 3.00% 3.60% The assumption on the rate of increase of pensionable salaries in the UK scheme has been restricted.
This is due to the introduction of salary capping entitlement arrangements with respect to the defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008.
The expected long-term rates of return on the scheme assets as at 31 March were: 2010 2009 2008 Equities 7.50% 7.20% 7.60% Corporate bonds 4.75% 5.75% 5.40% Diversified growth funds 7.00% 6.70% 7.10% Enhanced matching funds 3.70% 3.40% 4.25% Hedge funds 7.50% n a n a Credit funds 6.50% n a n a Government bonds 4.00% 3.70% 4.10% Cash 0.00% 0.00% 4.75% The valuation of the assets of the scheme as at 31 March was: 2010 2009 2008 m m m Equities 86.8 79.9 113.2 Corporate bonds 17.4 14.4 14.6 Government bonds 6.1 16.5 18.9 Diversified growth funds 126.7 94.0 98.9 Enhanced matching funds 37.5 34.8 27.9 Hedge funds 15.8 Credit funds 12.2 Cash 2.1 0.7 0.9 Total market value of assets 304.6 240.3 274.4 The valuation of the scheme as at 31 March was: 2010 2009 m m Total market value of assets 304.6 240.3 Present value of scheme liabilities 314.8 246.6 Deficit in the scheme recognised in the accounts of RS Components Ltd 10.2 6.3 Related deferred tax asset 2.9 1.8 Net pension liability 7.3 4.5 In addition, the value of the assets held in respect of AVCs amounted to 0.5m as at 31 March 2010 2009: 0.6m.
