In line with IFRS 2 Share-based payment, the Group has fair valued all grants of equity instruments issued after 7 November 2002 which were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 17m 2009: 14m, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After corporation and deferred tax, the total charge in the income statement was 16m 2009: 11m.
a Share option schemes i Executive share option scheme In May 1995, the Group adopted the 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme which was made available to Directors and other senior employees.
The scheme was terminated on 25 May 2005.
The scheme offered options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the grant which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The maximum exercise value of the ordinary shares subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and 100,000.
The exercise of options under the scheme is subject to performance criteria broadly requiring an increase in Group operating profits of at least 20% between the year prior to the date of the grant and its third or any succeeding anniversary.
Those options which have been granted after 7 November 2002 have been fair valued using a binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The fair value of options granted and the assumptions were as follows: Grant date 12 Nov 2004 02 Apr 2003 Share price at grant date 2.33 1.81 Fair value of options granted 1.4m 1.9m Exercise price 2.22 1.75 Dividend yield 1.43% 1.49% Annual risk free interest rate 4.61% 4.12% Expected volatility 29.4% 29.4% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the last six years prior to the date of grant.

The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 250 each month for a fixed period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is only subject to service conditions and is equity-settled.
Options granted before 7 November 2002 The Group has not fair valued the Sharesave plan since the grants of the options were all made before 7 November 2002 and remained unvested as at 1 January 2005.

The fair value of options granted and the assumptions were as follows: Grant date 14 May 2009 18 May 2007 24 Apr 2006 Share price at grant date 2.43 3.26 1.94 Fair value of options granted 17.4m 12.3 m 16.2m Exercise price 1.98 2.47 1.58 Dividend yield 2.38% 1.23% 1.91% Annual risk free interest rate 2.10% 5.58% 4.57% Expected volatility 28.0% 23.5% 25.6% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.25 years prior to the date of grant.
The requirement that the employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the binomial stochastic option pricing model using the assumptions disclosed above.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

The awards are free share-based awards, with non-market vesting conditions attached, that accrue the value of dividends over the vesting period.
The maximum total market value of shares over which awards may be granted to any employee during any financial year of the company is 300% of salary.
Awards normally vest three years after the original grant date providing the relevant performance criteria have been met.
The fair value at the date of grant, which is being charged to the income statement over the three year vesting period, has been calculated based on the following assumptions: Grant date 29 Jan 20 Oct 9 April 14 Oct 14 Apr 24 Oct 6 Jun 24 May 2010 2009 2009 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 Share price at grant date 2.93 2.71 2.50 2.42 2.77 2.88 3.13 3.23 Assumed leavers 5% 5% 5% 5% 4% 3% 3% Performance criteria achieved 90% 90% 90% 90% 90% 90% 90% 90% Exercise price nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil Fair value of share awards granted 1.1m 1.0m 18.8m 0.6m 12.5m 0.4m 0.1m 10.5m Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2010
