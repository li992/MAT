On the termination of these derivatives, amounts previously charged to reserves are required to be recycled through the income statement where the facilities to which they relate are not expected to be utilised.
During the period the Group recycled 11.6 million of losses from the hedging reserve to the income statement.
The remaining hedging reserve of 4.6 million relates to facilities which are expected to be utilised and will be amortised to the income statement over the outstanding term of the derivatives had they not been terminated.

The Groups net deferred tax at 31 March 2010 is nil 2009: nil.
A deferred tax asset of 8.2 million, mainly relating to tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2010 and deferred tax arising in respect of the fair value of derivatives, was not recognised because it is uncertain whether future taxable profits will arise against which these losses can be offset.
The Group converted to a REIT on 1 January 2007 and as such is largely exempt from corporation tax in respect of its rental profits and chargeable gains relating to its property rental business.
The Group is otherwise subject to corporation tax.
The Group estimates that as the majority of its future profits will not be subject to corporation tax, it will have a very low tax charge over the coming years.
In order to ensure that the Group is able to both retain its status as a REIT and to avoid financial charges being imposed, a number of tests including a minimum distribution test must be met by both Great Portland Estates plc and by the Group as a whole on an ongoing basis.
These conditions are detailed in the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
