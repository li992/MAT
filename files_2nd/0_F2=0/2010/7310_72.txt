Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP On 19 June 2008, shareholders at the Annual General Meeting AGM of the Company approved the 2008 LTIP.
Under the terms of the plan, the LTIP awards will be in the form of full-value shares Performance Shares, subject to performance and time-vesting conditions.
Eligible employees will normally be considered by the Remuneration Committee for an award once each year.
Awards made to the Executive Directors of the Company under the LTIP are called First Awards.
Participants in the First Award, however, will not be entitled to any further awards until the 2011 financial year.
Awards will normally be made during the period of 42 days following the announcement of year end or half-year financial results.
Exceptionally, the First Awards under the plan on 19 June 2008, were permitted to be made within 42 days following approval of the LTIP at the June 2008 AGM.
Financial Statements 2010 heritage oil plc 34 notes to consolidated financial statements continued 21 share-based paYments continued The plan is intended to apply to Executive Directors and other employees in senior management or leadership roles.
By exception, other higher performing and high potential employees may be considered for awards.
Participants in the LTIP are not entitled to any further awards under the 2008 Scheme.
The vesting of shares under award are subject to performance conditions agreed by the Remuneration Committee when the award is made.
For the First Awards made in 2008 the performance conditions are the relative Total Shareholder Returns TSR capital gain plus dividends performance of the Company versus that of a comparator group of international oil companies and a requirement for the share price of the Company to have increased by 20% over the vesting period of three years.
Furthermore, there is an additional holding period of one year following the awards vesting.
The Remuneration Committee, in consultation with executive reward consultants, approved grants of shares to Executive Directors, senior management and other employees in leadership roles under the LTIP.
The maximum annual, individual award for participants who are not Executive Directors is 250% of base package expressed as the face value of the shares.
The First Award to the Executive Directors is 1,200% of base package for the CEO and 800% of base package for the CFO.
The First Awards vest after three years provided that the performance conditions are met.
The awards granted to senior management and other employees in leadership roles are in three tranches that vest after three, four and five years respectively, provided that the performance condition is met at that time.
The awards will vest in line with the following schedule: Senior management and other employees in leadership First Awards role awards TSR performance versus comparator group of 18 companies proportion vesting proportion vesting 3rd place and above 100% of the award 100% of the award 4th place 80% 100% 5th place 50% 100% 6th place 30% 100% 7th place and below 0% 100% 9th place median 0% 100% 10th place and below 0% 0% TSR is measured in comparison to a peer group of 18 oil companies selected based on one of or a combination of size market capitalisation, revenue, turnover, cash expenditure or a combination thereof, area of operations and country of domicile.
The TSR measurement is conducted by independent consultants in discussion with the Remuneration Committee.
Since there are market-related conditions the awards of the shares under LTIP were fair valued using the Monte Carlo model which takes into account the market-based performance conditions which effectively estimate the number of shares expected to vest.
No subsequent adjustment is made to the fair value charge for shares that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met.
Adjustments are, however, made for leavers.
The fair value of the awards is recognised as an employee expense with the corresponding increase in equity.
The total amount to be expensed is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares and options.
The table below summarises the main assumptions used to fair value the awards made under the above LTIP and the fair values of the shares granted.
