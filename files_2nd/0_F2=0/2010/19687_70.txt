a The directors consider that the carrying amount recorded in the financial statements approximates their fair value.
b Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value.
The fair value is calculated using quoted market prices relevant for the term and instrument.
Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, are required to be grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are the only financial instruments held by the Group at fair value.
The net liability of 18.3m recognised as at 30th November 2010 2009: 19.3m is categorised as a Level 2 fair value measurement.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMeNTS CONTINUED Market risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income or the Group net worth arising from movements in interest rates or other market prices.
Interest rate risk is the Groups principal market risk and is considered below.
Interest rate risk management: The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at variable interest rates.
The Group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate swaps to manage the risk.
Interest rate sensitivity: The following table details the Groups sensitivity, after tax, to a 1% change in interest rates based on year end levels of debt.
2010 2009 1% increase in interest rates m m Interest on borrowings 2.3 2.3 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.9 1.7 0.4 0.6 2010 2009 1% decrease in interest rates m m Interest on borrowings 2.3 2.3 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.9 1.7 0.4 0.6 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations as they fall due.
The credit risk on the Groups liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high generally AA credit ratings.
Bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with Group policy that specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
Trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas.
The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 1.5m 2009: 2.2m of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.
Included within trade and other receivables is 0.7m 2009: 1.0m which is provided against as it represents estimated irrecoverable amounts.
This allowance has been determined by a review of all significant balances that are past due considering the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
A reconciliation of the changes in this account during the year is provided below.
