Corporate information The Groups consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 3 March 2011.
Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Unions EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The Company has elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
These are presented on pages 104 to 121 and the accounting policies in respect of the Company are set out on pages 105 to 108.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except unless otherwise indicated.
The Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRS.
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below and the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 although the comparative financial information has been restated for the change in reporting currency referred to below.
Change in reporting currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars following a decision to change the reporting currency from sterling during the year.
The change was made in order to give a clearer understanding of Spirents performance, more closely reflecting the profile of the Groups revenue and operating profit which are primarily generated in US dollars or US dollar-linked currencies.
The currency translation reserve was set to zero at 1 January 2003 on transition to IFRS and has been re-presented on the basis that the Group has reported in US dollars since that date.
Share capital, share premium account, capital redemption reserve, capital reserve and cash flow hedge reserve are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and the resultant exchange differences are included in other reserves.
The reporting currency of the parent Company remains as sterling, as it is located in the United Kingdom and its functional currency is sterling.
It will retain its share capital denominated in sterling.
Since the change in reporting currency has been applied retrospectively all comparative numbers in these consolidated financial statements have been restated into US dollars.
Note 32 sets out in detail how the financial statements have been converted.
New accounting standards The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time in the current period and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 59 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cashgenerating units monitored by management.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit, an operation within a cash-generating unit, an associate or jointly controlled entity is included in the profit or loss on its disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Separately identifiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists and relationships are capitalised on the balance sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business.
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Product development Research expenditure is recognised in the year in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets arising on the Groups various product development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has been established.
Technological feasibility in Spirents circumstances occurs when a working model is completed.
For software development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment at each reporting date where there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assessed at least annually.
When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected cash 60 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 overview business review governance financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued flows value in use of the relevant cash-generating unit or asset and the fair value less cost to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
This does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment loss must not be reversed in any circumstances.
Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Leases Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not finance leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the Groups operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated into the Groups presentation currency at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of foreign operations are translated into US dollars using average rates.
The exchange differences arising on retranslation are classified as a separate component of equity, the translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards which allows the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS, being 1 January 2003.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Such allowances are based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer exposures.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 61 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign currencies relating to firm commitments.
Previously the Group also managed exposures arising on highly probable forecast transactions.
This change in treasury policy arose as a consequence of the change in the Groups reporting currency from sterling to US dollars.
As the number of transactions now being hedged is significantly reduced and restricted to items which affect profit or loss or are recognised on the balance sheet at the balance sheet date, the Group has ceased to adopt the hedge accounting rules for all transactions entered into since the decision was taken to change the reporting currency.
The Group previously designated its forward foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and such designation was maintained until maturity of those remaining contracts in 2010.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Changes in the fair value of contracts which were designated as effective hedges were recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge recognised immediately in the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
For effective hedges that were in relation to a financial asset or liability, amounts originally deferred were recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affected profit or loss, for example when a highly probable forecast sale occurred.
For non-financial assets or liabilities, the gains or losses that were included in equity were included in the initial measurement of the non-financial asset or liability at the time the asset or liability was recognised on the balance sheet.
The Group discontinued hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expired or was sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer met the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revoked the designation.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which were cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, were taken to the income statement immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Retirement benefits The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension plans which are in the United Kingdom, all other pension plans are defined contribution in nature.
For the defined contribution plans the amount charged to the income statement is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, and updates are performed at each balance sheet date.
The cost of providing benefits under these plans is determined separately for each plan, and attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost, and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued, 62 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 overview business review governance financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit pension plan cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the income statement as finance costs or finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, experience adjustments on liabilities and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The defined benefit pension plan asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency and whose term is consistent with the estimated term of the obligation, less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover, by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining.
It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above.
Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Employee benefits When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment The Group operates various equity-settled share-based compensation plans and accounts for these awards in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions available on first-time adoption of IFRS, the Standard has been applied to awards granted after 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The fair value of these awards is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period together with a corresponding change in equity.
The fair value is measured using a binomial model by reference to the share price at the date the awards were granted and taking into account the best estimate of the number of awards expected to vest.
The charge is reassessed at each balance sheet date to reflect the expected and actual levels of vesting, except where the failure to vest is a result of not meeting a market condition.
Awards where vesting is Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 63 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued conditional upon satisfying a market condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market condition has been satisfied.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period it is approved by the directors, and the final dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates.
The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group tests annually by cash-generating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions.
These are described in note 13.
Defined benefit pension plans The pension cost and the defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension plans are based on a number of selected assumptions, these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, longevity and expected return on the plans assets.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods.
The effect of changing these assumptions is described in note 9.
64 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 overview business review governance financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition For revenue recognition purposes contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
Management exercises a degree of judgement in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which involves several elements should be recognised.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain.
For example liabilities are recognised for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be due based on the facts and circumstances known at the time the financial statements are prepared.
Where the final outcome differs from the amounts that were initially recorded the differences will be recorded in the future period in which the determination is made.
Deferred taxes The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management.
A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different recognition outcome.
Provisions The Group records a provision for vacant property based on future rentals and reduced by its expected ability to sublease the vacant space to a third party.
Provisions are discounted where the effect is significant.
Changes in the actual outcome compared with the expected outcome on subleasing or changes to other assumptions will be recorded in future periods.
New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for the Group after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Effective for annual Standards IAS IFRS periods beginning on or after IAS 12 Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax Recovery of Underlying Assets 1 January 2012 IAS 24 revised Related Party Disclosures 1 January 2011 IAS 32 Amendment to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues 1 February 2010 IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters 1 July 2011 IFRS 7 Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets 1 July 2011 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2013 IFRIC 14 Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement 1 January 2011 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 1 July 2010 Improvements to IFRSs May 2010 Various The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.

Operating segments The Groups organisational structure is based on differences in the products and services offered by each segment and information regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, is presented on this basis.
The Groups operating segments follow this structure, however where operating segments exhibit similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature they are aggregated into a single reportable segment.
The Groups reportable operating segments are Performance Analysis, Service Assurance and Systems.
The Group evaluates segment operating profit before share-based payment, acquired intangible asset amortisation and exceptional items, although there were no exceptional operating items in 2010 or 2009.
Finance income and finance costs are not allocated to the reportable segments.
Corporate is not an operating segment and costs are separately reported and not allocated to the reportable segments.
Corporate assets comprise cash and cash equivalents held for central treasury purposes and other corporate assets.
Information on segment liabilities is not regularly provided to the Groups Chief Executive Officer and is therefore not disclosed below.
The principal activities of each reportable operating segment are as follows: Performance Analysis provides solutions that test a broad range of communications technologies critical to the development of next-generation network equipment and devices.
Service Assurance provides network monitoring and field test solutions to allow service providers to diagnose, troubleshoot and determine how to resolve issues with networks and systems within the live network.
Systems develops and supplies sophisticated electronic control systems for electrically powered vehicles in the medical mobility and industrial markets.

The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.
Following the UK Governments announcement in 2010, the inflation index to be used to derive statutory increases to pensions, both before and after they come into payment, has been changed from the Retail Prices Index RPI to the Consumer Prices Index CPI.
In the Staff Plan, the increases provided to pensions before they come into payment are at the statutory level and hence are impacted by this change.
However, the increases provided to pensions after they come into payment are prescribed by the plan rules and are not impacted.
Due to a number of differences between the indices, including both constituents and construction, CPI is expected to be lower than RPI over the long term which means that the defined benefit obligation has reduced.
This reduction has been recognised as an assumption change at 31 December 2010.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 68 2009 aged 68: 2008 aged 65 will live on average for a further 19.2 years 2009 19.1 years: 2008 21.7 years if they are male and for a further 21.0 years 2009 20.9 years: 2008 24.0 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2020 2009 in 2019: 2008 in 2028 at age 64 2009 age 64: 2008 age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 23.7 years 2009 23.6 years: 2008 22.9 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.6 years 2009 25.5 years: 2008 25.0 years after retirement if they are female.
70 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 overview business review governance financial statements 9.
Pensions continued The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum.
This would increase past service liabilities by $3.1 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor.
This would increase past service liabilities by $7.1 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.

Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the HMRC statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only.
The Group has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2010 of $0.6 million 2009 $0.6 million.
This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Groups pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation and adjusted each year.
There were no experience gains or losses in the period from 2006 to 2010 on the unfunded plan.
Expected contributions for these plans for 2011 are $2.8 million, including $2.4 million of additional contributions to fund the deficit arising from the actuarial valuation completed in 2010.
Defined contribution plans United Kingdom The Group maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom.
Employer contributions into these plans for 2010 were $1.1 million 2009 $1.3 million.
United States The Group maintains a defined contribution pension plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries.
This plan, also known as a 401 k Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement.
The investment choices offered by the plan are a selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk.
In aggregate, the Groups contributions to the US plan totalled $3.0 million for 2010 2009 $3.1 million.
Total assets in the defined contribution plan at the end of 2010 were $144.9 million 2009 $123.6 million.
There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2010 or 2009.

Intangible assets continued Annual impairment test The recoverable amount of the Performance Analysis cash-generating unit at 30 November 2010, the annual impairment testing date, has been determined based on a value in use calculation using managements cash flow projections over a five year period.
Cash flows in subsequent years have been extrapolated using a 2.75 per cent growth rate 2009 2.75 per cent which management estimates to be the approximate average long term growth rate for the industries in which this unit operates.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14.6 per cent 2009 17.6 per cent.
The recoverable amount of this unit, calculated on a value in use basis, was in excess of its carrying value and consequently no impairment has been recognised.
Key assumptions for the annual impairment test The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation were: Revenue growth rates Gross margin Operating expenses Discount rate Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five year period covered by managements projections Projections are denominated in the same currency as the denomination of the goodwill balance to eliminate the effect of fluctuating exchange rates.
Revenue growth rates used in managements projections are based on managements estimate of growth in the markets served.
The cash flows used in the impairment review have been approved by the Board.
Gross margins and operating expenses are based on historical values adjusted for the effect of revenue growth.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on the risk free rate for ten year government bonds adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk associated with investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific cash-generating unit.
Long term growth rates are based upon managements estimate.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions The directors believe that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used in isolation would cause the carrying value of Performance Analysis to exceed its recoverable amount.

in 2008 $41.9 million of temporary differences were not recognised as there was insufficient evidence under iAS 12 to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of these temporary differences.
the Group has tax losses arising in the united Kingdom of $94.2 million 2009 $100.1 million: 2008 $132.2 million that are available for offset against suitable future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery is uncertain.
united Kingdom tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
in total deferred tax assets amounting to $27.5 million 2009 $30.8 million: 2008 $53.6 million have not been recognised.
the chancellor, in the Budget on 22 June 2010, announced reductions in the main rate of corporation tax and rates of capital allowances.
the standard rate of uK corporation tax will be reduced from 28 per cent to 27 per cent from 1 April 2011, and there will be progressive annual reductions of a further 1 per cent until a rate of 24 per cent is reached with effect from 1 April 2014. the Finance Act no 2 2010 received Royal Assent on 27 July 2010, with the first of the rate reductions being substantively enacted from 21 July 2010. the deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 27 per cent.
Whilst detailed calculations have not been prepared at this stage, it is estimated that the impact of the remaining annual corporation tax rate reductions would not be material to the financial statements.

Where material, lease obligations are discounted.
The Group expects these provisions to be utilised over the next five years.
Other provisions are mainly environmental provisions on property disposed of.
The Group expects these provisions to be utilised in less than one year.
Derivative financial instruments The derivative financial instruments are forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign currencies relating to firm commitments.
In 2009 the Group also managed exposures arising on highly probable forecast transactions.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 83 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 24.
Derivative financial instruments continued At 31 December 2010 and 2009 the Group held various forward foreign currency exchange contracts in respect of the forward sale of US dollars against sterling and for the purchase of euro against sterling on trading transactions.
2009 2010 restated $ million $ million Sale of US dollars against sterling at an average rate of 1.57 2009 1.57 14.8 27.9 Purchase of euro against sterling at an average rate of 1.18 2009 1.11 0.9 2.3 These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2009.
Following the change in reporting currency to US dollars in 2010 the Group has chosen not to designate any new contracts as hedges.

Financial instruments and financial risk management The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions is to fund the Groups liquidity requirements.
All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables with the exception of the derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value.
These are shown in the following table: 2009 2010 restated $ million $ million Loans and Derivative Loans and Derivative receivables financial receivables financial at amortised instruments at amortised instruments cost at fair value cost at fair value Non-current cash on deposit note 19 1.1 1.8 Non-current other receivables note 18 3.4 2.9 Cash and cash equivalents note 19 223.9 173.9 Current trade and other receivables note 18 85.2 70.7 Currency derivatives that are designated hedges note 24 1.0 Financial assets 313.6 249.3 1.0 Non-current other payables note 22 1.4 1.6 Current trade payables note 20 27.0 18.8 Accruals 48.6 39.9 Provisions note 23 7.6 11.4 Currency derivatives that are not designated hedges note 24 0.2 Currency derivatives that are designated hedges note 24 0.2 Financial liabilities 84.6 0.2 71.7 0.2 The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Groups foreign currency exposures when deemed appropriate.
The key objective of the Groups treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group.
All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework.
The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities.
Additionally, it is the Groups policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
a Market risk The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk The Group has no external debt and has limited exposure to interest rate risk.
The Groups excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and the United States and invested in short term bank deposits.
It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Groups financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 85 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 25.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Short term bank deposits all mature within three months.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts all mature within three months 2009 one year.
The financial instruments bear the following interest rates: Effective Effective 2009 interest rate 2010 interest rate restated % $ million % $ million Fixed rate Fixed deposits 0.40 97.5 0.42 107.4 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts net 0.2 0.8 97.3 108.2 Floating rate Cash at bank and in hand 126.4 66.5 Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
All fixed rate deposits mature within three months after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest.
In addition, $1.1 million 2009 $1.8 million was held in a blocked trust account and was earning interest of 0.71 per cent at 31 December 2010 2009 0.61 per cent.
The maturity of the deposit is three months, at maturity the interest rate will be reset.
This cash must be retained in the blocked trust account in accordance with the terms of the undertakings made at the time of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation in 2004.
The funds must remain in this account until creditors which existed at the date of the Cancellation have been repaid and therefore the maturity of this account is uncertain.
Interest receivable for the year was $0.8 million note 6 2009 $0.6 million and is under the effective interest method.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
A movement of 25 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2010 would increase or reduce interest income and equity by $0.3 million.
Exchange rate risk Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has the majority of its operations in the United States and has chosen with effect from 1 January 2010 to present its consolidated financial statements in US dollars.
The Companys functional currency is sterling and its share capital is denominated in pounds sterling, the Group also has operations in Europe and Asia and therefore its results and assets and liabilities are affected on translation by movements in exchange rates in relation to the US dollar.
The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are considered accounting and not cash exposures.
The Group is not exposed to significant transactional foreign currency risk at 31 December 2010, nor at 31 December 2009, because the majority of its businesses do not enter into non-functional currency transactions.
Where such transactions do occur the Group enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as appropriate.
Group treasury, by means of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out the transaction hedging activity in relation to normal trading activity.
At 31 December 2010 the Group has hedged its financial assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
In 2009 the Group also hedged its forecast trading receipts and payments.
86 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 overview business review governance financial statements 25.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued b Credit risk Investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board and as such short term deposits are limited to banks with a rating of Standard & Poors A or Moodys A.
There are pre-approved limits set for each bank to avoid any concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to cash and bank deposits is equal to the carrying value of $225.0 million 2009 $175.7 million.
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectable amounts where appropriate.
Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of $81.7 million 2009 $67.5 million.
The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows: 2009 2010 restated $ million $ million Neither impaired nor past due 45.0 44.0 Past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days overdue 24.1 15.6 30 to 60 days 5.9 3.2 Over 60 days 6.7 4.7 Trade receivables 81.7 67.5 The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and review of payment history and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits.
Based on these procedures management assessed the quality of those receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk.
The movement on the receivables provision during the year is given in note 18.
The value of impaired trade receivables is $0.6 million 2009 $2.1 million.
For all other financial assets the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount.
c Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements.
Its operations are financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations.
At 31 December 2010 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $223.9 million 2009 $173.9 million all of which matures within three months.
During 2010 the Group generated $99.4 million of cash from operating activities 2009 $96.1 million and considers that with current cash resources, no debt and positive cash flow from its operating activities it has adequate resources available to it to remain in operational existence for the forseeable future.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 87 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 25.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The Group has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts all of which mature within 3 months 2009 one year.
The gross settlement amounts of these contracts are as follows: 2009 2010 restated $ million $ million Sale of US dollars against sterling 14.8 27.9 Purchase of euro against sterling 0.9 2.3 Gross settlement amounts 15.7 30.2 The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable.
Financial liabilities, other than derivative financial liabilities, are trade and other payables, the majority of which are all due to be settled within one year, and provisions note 23.
The Group does not have any other material financial contractual commitments.
d Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The fair value of currency derivatives is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, and is therefore determined to be a level 2 financial instrument as its value is based on observable market inputs.
e Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Groups capital is its total shareholders funds.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions.
During 2009 and 2010 the Company has been operating an on market share repurchase programme.
In 2010 the Company repurchased 10.4 million of its Ordinary Shares at a cost of $19.7 million.
In 2009 the Company repurchased 0.6 million of its Ordinary Shares at a cost of $0.9 million.
Operating lease commitments At 31 December, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2009 2010 restated $ million $ million Within one year 11.2 10.9 In the second to fifth years 16.3 21.6 Over five years 1.0 27.5 33.5 The Group leases certain land and buildings under non-cancellable operating lease agreements with a variety of terms.
The Group also leases certain plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Total future sublease payments receivable relating to the above leases amount to $1.0 million 2009 $2.1 million of which $0.9 million 2009 $1.0 million will be recognised within one year and the balance in the second to fifth year.

There has been no material increase in the issued Ordinary Share capital, whether by exercise of share incentives or otherwise, between 31 December 2010 and 3 March 2011, the date on which these financial statements have been signed.
b Equity and reserves The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows: i Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value: ii Capital redemption reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share capital cancellation: iii Capital reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share option plans in acquired companies: iv Other reserves: share capital, share premium account, capital redemption reserve, capital reserve and cash flow hedge reserve are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and the resultant exchange differences are included in other reserves: Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 89 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 27.
Equity continued v Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries: and vi Cash flow hedge reserve: this reserve records movements in the fair value of effective forward foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares At 31 December 2010, an amount of $300.4 million 2009 $282.6 million has cumulatively been deducted from retained earnings in relation to the cost of investment in own Ordinary Shares.
At 31 December 2010, the ESOT held 4.0 million Ordinary Shares 2009 5.4 million Ordinary Shares to satisfy awards under various share incentive plans.
Of this number, 0.1 million Ordinary Shares were unconditionally vested at 31 December 2010 2009 0.1 million Ordinary Shares.
At 31 December 2010, the SST held 0.5 million Ordinary Shares 2009 0.6 million Ordinary Shares to satisfy awards made to UK based employees under an all employee share scheme.
The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, being in total 4.5 million Ordinary Shares 2009 6.0 million Ordinary Shares, at 31 December 2010 was $10.4 million 2009 $9.8 million.
Cancellation of share premium account and capital redemption reserve On 24 November 2004, Spirent Communications plc was granted an order of the High Court for the approval of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation which stood at that date at $1,321.1 million 702.7 million and $1.3 million 0.7 million, respectively.
The Cancellation created a reserve in the financial statements of the Company which was applied to eliminate the deficit in distributable reserves.
The balance of this reserve, created after the deficit in distributable reserves had been eliminated, was transferred to a special non-distributable reserve.
During 2006 the Company transferred funds equal to the aggregate amount due to any creditors of Spirent Communications plc, who were creditors on 24 November 2004, and who still remained creditors, to a blocked trust account.
Placing these funds in a blocked trust account in accordance with the undertakings made at the time of the Cancellation allowed the special reserve to be released to distributable reserves.
Capital redemption reserve During 2010 the Company cancelled 9.8 million Ordinary Shares 2009 0.6 million Ordinary Shares that had been the subject of the on market share repurchase programme, and transferred $0.5 million 2009 $32,000 to the capital redemption reserve.

Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share-settled stock appreciation rights SARs and Performance shares.
No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have been met.
For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Companys earnings per share EPS and for Performance shares, relate to total shareholder return TSR.
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 46 and 47.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan was primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Grants were also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Under the SSIP, the Company was able to grant share options and share-settled SARs.
No price was payable on the grant of an award.
92 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010 overview business review governance financial statements 28.
Employee share plans continued Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment.
Vesting is not normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the date of grant will lapse.
The vesting of SSIP awards made to Bill Burns prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and to certain other key senior managers within the Communications group, were subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting periods.
Further details of these performance conditions are set out in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 47 and 48.
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over the base price of the SAR in the form of Ordinary Shares.
This SARs approach helps the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded.
Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
At 31 December 2010, 0.5 million EIP SARs and 11.0 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 50 pence and 55 pence respectively were outstanding 2009 1.9 million EIP SARs and 17.6 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 50 pence and 56 pence respectively.
During 2010, 7.3 million EIP and SSIP SARs were exercised resulting in the issue of 4.0 million Ordinary Shares 2009 3.1 million Ordinary Shares were issued on the exercise of 9.4 million EIP and SSIP SARs.
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC approved options, were on a discretionary basis.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised.
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of their respective grant dates.
Acquisition plans Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan NARSOP Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. Netcom in 1999.
$44.5 million of the total consideration was satisfied through the roll-over of outstanding options over Netcom shares into options over approximately 23.8 million Ordinary Shares as adjusted on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
At 31 December 2010 there are no remaining outstanding NARSOP options and the plan has therefore been closed.
Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan ZARSOP Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary Shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems Corporation Zarak in 2000, approximately 3.8 million Ordinary Shares arose in connection with the roll-over of outstanding options over Zarak shares into options over Spirent Ordinary Shares on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
At 31 December 2010 there are no remaining outstanding ZARSOP options and the plan has therefore been closed.
Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan CARSP Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. Caw in 2002 of $49 million, approximately $4 million was in respect of Spirent Ordinary Shares and options which arose on the roll-over of outstanding options and shares under the previous Caw employee stock plan.
The options and shares vested over a period ending in 2006 on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
The options have a ten year life from the original date of grant.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement for Caw, an additional cash payment of 78.8 US cents was payable as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
No further awards can be made under this plan.
The Ordinary Shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak and Caw, or granted under the SSIP, do not count towards ABI scheme limits.

Employee share plans continued All Employee plans UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme.
SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made.
Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the commitment to deliver Ordinary Shares against the exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS.
Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST.
During the year, 0.1 million Ordinary Shares were transferred to participants 2009 0.3 million Ordinary Shares.
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003.
US Employee Stock Purchase Plan US ESPP The US ESPP enables the Company to invite all US employees to acquire shares in the Company on market using deductions from payroll.
In November 2010 such an invitation was made, with deductions from payroll commencing in January 2011.
The US ESPP also enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent Ordinary Shares using the proceeds of a savings contract.
If such a grant were made, when joining the US ESPP, participants would enter into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit of $1,000 per month.
Prior to the invitation in November 2010, no offer had been made under this plan since 2003.
Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP offers employees in countries other than the UK or US an opportunity to share in the Companys performance through share ownership.
The GAESPP was implemented in Canada in January 2002 and operated on similar terms to the US ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual maximum of Cdn $1,000 per month.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003.
UK Employee Share Purchase Plan UK ESPP The UK ESPP, which is an HMRC approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and is available to all UK employees.
The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares.
The UK ESPP will operate in conjunction with a trust, which holds the shares on behalf of participants.
In November 2010, the Company made an invitation to all UK employees to acquire Partnership shares on market using deductions from payroll, commencing in January 2011.
Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP The SARP was introduced in September 1999 as an interim incentive arrangement for the employees of Netcom following the closure of the NARSOP described above and subsequently for certain other employees in the Communications group.
Rights under the SARP vested over four years, 25 per cent vesting one year after the date of grant and the remainder vesting on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Rights granted were not subject to the fulfilment of any performance conditions.
The SARP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary Share over the rights price in the form of existing Ordinary Shares which have been purchased in the market by the Companys ESOT.
The SARP is closed and no further grants can be made under it.
At 31 December 2010 there are no remaining outstanding SARP options and the plan has therefore been closed.

Share-based payment The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows: 2009 2010 restated $ million $ million 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.3 0.2 Spirent Stock Incentive Plan 0.1 0.4 0.4 0.6 All schemes are equity-settled.
No share incentives were granted during 2010.
For 2009 the fair value of share incentives has been estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge and the fair value: 2010 2009 Weighted average share price pence 96.3 Weighted average exercise price pence 3.9 Weighted average fair value pence 29.4 Expected volatility % 5355 Expected life years 4.5 Risk free rate % 2.42.5 Dividend yield % 2.0 The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For Performance shares granted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan, which have a market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be 30 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.

Explanation of the effect of a change to the reporting currency on prior year financial statements As referred to in note 2 during the period the Spirent Communications Group changed its reporting currency from pounds sterling to US dollars.
As a result, the Groups prior year Consolidated income statement, its prior year Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, its Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2009 and 2008, its prior year Consolidated cash flow statement and its Consolidated statement of changes in equity for 2009 and 2008, that were presented in the 2009 Annual Report, have been restated to show all amounts in US dollars.
This note explains the methodology used to translate amounts previously reported by the Group.
Consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2009 The Groups policy has been to translate transactions in foreign currencies at the average rate applicable during the financial year unless this would produce a material difference compared with using the spot rate of exchange.
The Consolidated income statement has therefore been translated into US dollars using an average exchange rate for 2009 of 1.57 US dollars to 1 pound sterling or the spot US dollar to sterling rate ruling on the date of the specific transaction.
