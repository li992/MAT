Notes to the CoNsolidated FiNaNCial statemeNts CoNtiNued 18 post-RetiRement BeneFits the group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
For the uK defined benefit schemes, the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service.
overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
Additionally in the us, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
the valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, updated by the scheme actuaries to December 31, 2010. the most recent funding valuations of the main uK schemes were: Scheme Valuation date Rolls-Royce pension Fund march 31, 2009 Rolls-Royce group pension scheme provisional April 5, 2010 Vickers group pension scheme provisional march 31, 2010 Amounts recognised in the income statement 2010 2009 UK Overseas uK overseas schemes schemes Total schemes schemes total m m m m m m Defined benefit schemes: current service cost 118 34 152 94 29 123 past service cost 1 1 2 4 6 curtailment 6 6 118 29 147 96 33 129 Defined contribution schemes 11 32 43 8 29 37 operating cost 129 61 190 104 62 166 Financing in respect of defined benefit schemes: expected return on assets 374 26 400 285 20 305 interest on liabilities 375 56 431 355 47 402 1 30 31 70 27 97 total income statement charge 130 91 221 174 89 263 the operating cost is charged as follows: Defined benefit Defined contribution Total 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m m m cost of sales 106 94 31 27 137 121 commercial and administrative costs 31 26 9 7 40 33 Research and development 10 9 3 3 13 12 147 129 43 37 190 166 the group operates a paysave scheme in the uK.
this a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and the group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result, there is a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of 35m 2009 36m in the year.

the discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds.
For the main uK schemes, the rate is determined by using the profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
For less significant uK schemes and overseas schemes, the rate is determined as the market yield at the average duration of the forecast benefit payments.
the discount rates above are the weighted average of those for each scheme, based on the value of their respective liabilities.
the assumptions have not been adjusted to reflect the uK governments announcement in 2010 to change the basis for the indexation of occupational pension schemes from the Retail prices index to the consumer price index.
the overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual returns expected from each asset class see below in accordance with the actual asset balance in the schemes investment portfolios.
the mortality assumptions adopted for the uK pension schemes are derived from the sAp actuarial tables, with 80 per cent of long cohort and an underpin of one per cent, published by the institute of Actuaries, projected forward and, where appropriate, adjusted to take account of the relevant schemes actual experience.
the resulting range of life expectancies in the principal uK schemes are as follows: Life expectancy from age 65 current pensioner 22.4 years Future pensioner currently aged 45 24.2 years other demographic assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
the assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the schemes.
Assumptions in respect of overseas schemes are also set in accordance with advice from local actuaries.
the future costs of healthcare benefits are based on an assumed healthcare costs trend rate of 8.4 per cent grading down to 5.0 per cent over five years.

Any surplus in excess of this benefit is not recognised in the balance sheet.
2 A minimum funding liability arises where the statutory funding requirements require future contributions in respect of past service that will result in a future unrecognisable surplus.

the scheme assets do not include any of the groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the group.
the expected rate of return for lDi portfolios is determined by the implicit yield on the portfolio at the balance sheet date.

in the uK, equities and corporate bonds are assumed to generate returns that exceed the return from gilts by 3.25 per cent and 1.0 per cent per annum respectively.
the expected rates of return above are the weighted average of the rates for each scheme.
Future contributions the group expects to contribute approximately 300m to its defined benefit schemes in 2011.
Sensitivities the revised investment strategies are designed to hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation on an economic basis.
A reduction of 0.25 per cent in the discount rate would increase the obligations of the principal uK defined benefit schemes by approximately 259m.
An equivalent movement in interest rates would increase the fair value of the assets by approximately 343m.
the difference arises largely due to differences in the methods used to value the obligations for accounting and economic purposes.
on an economic basis the correlation is in excess of 90 per cent.
the principal remaining risks relate to the assumptions for mortality and increases in salaries.
if the age ratings in respect of the principal uK defined benefit schemes were increased by one year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 119m.
if the rate of increase in salaries were 0.5 per cent higher, scheme liabilities would increase by 132m.
the defined benefit obligation relating to post-retirement medical benefits would increase by 72m if the healthcare trend rate increases by one per cent, and reduce by 58m if it decreases by one per cent.
the pension expense relating to post-retirement medical benefits, comprising service cost and interest cost, would increase by 7m if the healthcare trend increases by one per cent, and reduce by 5m if it decreases by one per cent.
