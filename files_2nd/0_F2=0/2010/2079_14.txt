We continue to invest in our business through economic cycles and maintain a long-term view.
Our consistently strong project execution over the past four years has led us to successfully deliver four major operated projects, the latest one being the Pyrenees floating production storage and offtake facility offshore Western Australia.
Combined with Shenzi and Neptune in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Stybarrow in Western Australia, we have proven our ability to safely deliver large,  projects in diverse and challenging environments.
Our financial strength allows us to continue to aggressively pursue exploration opportunities around the globe.
Our focus is on capturing and operating large acreage positions in areas that are material to BHP Billiton.
Over the past four years, we have substantially grown our captured acreage position and commenced one of the most aggressive drilling campaigns in the Groups history that will continue into the coming years.
