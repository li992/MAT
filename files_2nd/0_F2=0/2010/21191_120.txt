Share options Details of the EDs who were in office for any part of the financial year, and hold or held options over ordinary shares of the Company, pursuant to the Companys share based incentive plans, are set out in Table 16 below.
Savings-related share options in Table 16 refer to options granted under the HMRC approved Aviva Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
Options are normally exercisable during the six-month period following the end of the relevant three-, fiveor seven-year savings contract.
Executive share options approved in Table 16 refer to options granted under the HMRC approved schedule to the Aviva Executive Share Option Plan 2005.
Options will be exercisable on 30 March 2013 to the extent that the LTIP awards granted in 2010 have vested.
Any gain made on exercise of these options will be used to reduce the number of shares vesting under the LTIP.
Therefore, the vesting of the options will not increase the overall number of shares received by the EDs from their LTIP awards.
