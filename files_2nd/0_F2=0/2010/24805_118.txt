Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment which it has entered into with the Company.
The Manager monitors counterparty risk on an ongoing basis.
The Company has investments in convertible loan stocks that have an element of equity.
These securities are viewed as having a risk profile similar to the equity holdings.
This is because the convertibles held are in nascent technology companies that may be loss making and may have weak balance sheets.
For this reason these stocks are categorised as equity holdings.
The fixed interest securities held are UK Government securities and UK corporate bonds.
Credit Risk Exposure The exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: 2010 2009 000 000 Fixed interest investments 20,151 26,027 Cash and short term deposits 39,497 18,551 Debtors and prepayments 1,316 1,593 60,964 46,171 The maximum exposure in fixed interest investments was 27,331,000 2009 28,417,000 and the minimum 20,041,000 2009 15,948,000.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
C. Liquidity Risk The Companys policy with regard to liquidity is to provide a degree of flexibility so that the portfolio can be repositioned when appropriate and that most of the assets can be realised without an excessive discount to the market price.
The Companys unlisted investments are not readily realisable, but these only amount to 0.7% of the Companys total assets at 31 December 2010 2009: 0.9%.
In practice, liquidity in investee companies is imperfect, particularly those with a market value of less than 100 million.
To reduce this liquidity risk it is the policy to diversify the holdings and generally to restrict the holding in any one company to less than 10% of the share capital of that company.
Furthermore the guideline is for no single investment to account for more than 5% of the assets of the Company.
The market valuation of each underlying security gives an indication of value, but the price at which an investment can be made or realised can diverge materially from the bid or offer price depending on market conditions generally and particularly to each investment.
32% 160 million 2009: 36% 135 million of the portfolio is invested in stocks with a market capitalisation below 100 million, where liquidity is expected to be more limited.
If these stocks had on average a realisable value 20% below the bid price the value of the total fund would be adversely affected by 6.4% 2009: 7.1%.

Level 2: reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables includes only data from observable markets.
Level 3: reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on page 40.
