Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, after the deduction of the catch up entitlement of 10.4m on the Tier 1 preference share conversion, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, less the weighted average number of own shares held of the catch-up entitlement of 10.4m on the Tier 1 preference share conversion.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, after the deduction of the catch up entitlement of 10.4m on the Tier 1 preference share conversion, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during that period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Both calculations are performed after taking retrospective account of the restructuring of the Companys share capital.
