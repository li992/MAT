2 Segmental analysis Business segments The Group operates one class of business: rental of equipment.
Operationally, the Group is split into two business units, Sunbelt and A-Plant which separately report to, and are managed by, the chief executive and align with the geographies in which they operate, being the US and UK, respectively.
The Group also owned Ashtead Technology, which was sold in the prior year and therefore classified as a disposal group.
These business units are the basis on which the Group reports its segment information.
The Group manages debt and taxation centrally, rather than by business unit.
Accordingly, segmental results are stated before interest and taxation which are reported as central Group items.
This is consistent with the way the chief executive reviews the business.

a Trade receivables: credit risk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 23.
The credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and the invoicing conventions established in, the Groups markets.
The contractual terms on invoices issued to customers vary between the US and the UK in that, invoices issued by A-Plant are payable within 3060 days whereas, invoices issued by Sunbelt are payable on receipt.
Therefore, on this basis, a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables are contractually past due.
The allowance account for bad and doubtful receivables is calculated based on prior experience reflecting the level of uncollected receivables over the last year within each business.
Accordingly, this cannot be attributed to specific receivables so the aged analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is shown gross of the allowance for bad and doubtful receivables.

The growth rate assumptions used in the plans reflect managements expectations of market developments and take account of past performance.
The annual growth rate used to determine the cash flows beyond the three year period is 2% and does not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows is 9%.
A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken by changing the key assumptions used for both Sunbelt and A-Plant.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible change in the assumptions resulted in the carrying value of the goodwill in Sunbelt or A-Plant being reduced to the recoverable amount.

First priority senior secured credit facility During the year, the $1.84bn first priority asset based senior secured loan facility ABL facility was amended and now consists of a $1,313m revolving credit facility committed until November 2013 and a further $529m available on the original terms until August 2011 consisting of a $303m revolving credit facility and a $226m term loan.
The ABL facility is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.
Pricing for the revolver loan is based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA before exceptional items according to a grid which varies, depending on leverage, from LIBOR plus 300bp to LIBOR plus 375bp for the extended tranche and LIBOR plus 150bp to LIBOR plus 225bp for the non-extended tranche.
At 30 April 2010 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 350bp on the extended facility and LIBOR plus 200bp on the non-extended facility.
The term loan is priced at LIBOR plus 175bp.
The ABL facility carries minimal amortisation of $2.5m per annum on the term loan which will be met out of drawings from the committed revolver facility.
The ABL facility includes a springing covenant package under which quarterly financial performance covenants are tested only if available liquidity is less than $150m.
Available liquidity at 30 April 2010 was 351m $537m reflecting drawings under the facility at that date together with outstanding letters of credit of 19m $29m.
As the ABL facility is asset-based, the maximum amount available to be borrowed which includes drawings in the form of standby letters of credit depends on asset values receivables, inventory, rental equipment and real estate which are subject to periodic independent appraisal.
The maximum amount which could be drawn at 30 April 2010 was 704m $1,078m.
8.625% second priority senior secured notes due 2015 having a nominal value of $250m On 3 August 2005 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ashtead Holdings PLC, issued $250m of 8.625% second priority senior secured notes due 1 August 2015.
The notes are secured by second priority security interests over substantially the same assets as the ABL facility and are also guaranteed by Ashtead Group plc.
9% second priority senior secured notes due 2016 having a nominal value of $550m On 15 August 2006 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ashtead Capital, Inc. issued $550m of 9% second priority senior secured notes due 15 August 2016.
The notes are secured by second priority interests over substantially the same assets as the ABL facility and are also guaranteed by Ashtead Group plc.
Both note issues rank pari passu on a second lien basis.
Under the terms of both the 8.625% and 9% notes the Group is, subject to important exceptions, restricted in its ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with another company.

The provision is established based on advice received from independent actuaries of the estimated total cost of the self-insured retained risk based on historical claims experience.
The amount charged in the year is stated net of a 4.4m adjustment to reduce the provision held at 1 May 2009.
The majority of the provision for vacant property costs is expected to be utilised over a period of up to five years.

At the balance sheet date, no temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries have been recognised.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At 30 April 2010, 50m shares were held by the Company, acquired at an average cost of 67p and a further 5.7m shares were held by the Companys Employee Share Ownership Trust.

It holds a beneficial interest in 5,669,844 ordinary shares of the Company acquired at an average cost of 110.2p per share.
The shares had a market value of 6.7m at 30 April 2010.
The ESOT has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The costs of operating the ESOT are borne by the Group but are not significant.
Performance Share Plan Details of the Performance Share Plan PSP are given on pages 39 and 40.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2010, there was a net charge in respect of the PSP of 0.5m 2009: credit of 0.9m.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 0.2m 2009: credit of 0.7m.
The fair value of awards granted during the year is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price at grant date of 55.5p, nil exercise price, a dividend yield of 4.64%, volatility of 60.0%, a risk free rate of 2.20% and an expected life of three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model is based on the terms of the plan.
Discretionary share option schemes Details of the discretionary share option schemes are given on page 39.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the Group has not recognised any expense for these schemes as they were all granted prior to 7 November 2002.
Save-As-You-Earn SAYE schemes The costs of SAYE schemes are charged to the income statement over the vesting period based upon the fair value of the award at the grant date.
In 2010 the charge in respect of SAYE schemes was 31,000 2009: 0.1m.
All SAYE schemes have now expired.
No options relating to the SAYE scheme were exercised during the year.

22 Pensions The Group operates pension plans for the benefit of qualifying employees.
The major plans for new employees throughout the Group are all defined contribution plans following the introduction of the stakeholder pension plan for UK employees in May 2002.
Pension costs for defined contribution plans were 1.0m 2009: 5.1m.
The Group also has a defined benefit plan for UK employees which was closed to new members in 2001.
This plan is a funded defined benefit plan with trustee administered assets held separately from those of the Group.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 April 2007 and updated to 30 April 2010 by a qualified independent actuary.
The actuary is engaged by the Company to perform a valuation in accordance with IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuary were as follows: 2010 2009 Rate of increase in salaries 4.60% 4.10% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.60% 3.10% Discount rate 5.50% 7.00% Inflation assumption 3.60% 3.10% Weighted average expected return on plan assets 6.60% 7.20% Pensioner life expectancy assumed in the 30 April 2010 update is based on the S1 CMI 2009 projection model mortality tables adjusted so as to apply a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1.5% a year.
Samples of the ages to which pensioners are assumed to live are as follows: Male Female Pensioner aged 65 in 2010 87.1 89.5 Pensioner aged 65 in 2030 89.5 91.9 69 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Current service cost 0.3 0.7 Interest cost 3.0 3.1 Expected return on plan assets 3.2 4.1 Past service cost 0.2 Gains on curtailments and settlements 0.1 Total cost income 0.1 0.2 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2010 2009 m m Fair value of plan assets 55.9 44.0 Present value of defined benefit obligation 63.6 43.7 Net liability asset recognised in the balance sheet 7.7 0.3 Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2010 2009 m m At 1 May 43.7 49.5 Current service cost 0.3 0.7 Interest cost 3.0 3.1 National Insurance rebates received 0.4 0.2 Contributions from members 0.3 0.5 Actuarial loss gain experience gain 2.4 0.2 change in assumptions 20.1 9.1 Benefits paid 1.8 1.1 Past service cost 0.2 Curtailments and settlements 0.1 63.6 43.7 The actuarial loss in the year ended 30 April 2010 reflects the decrease in the required market discount rate that for AA rated corporate bonds in the year from 7.0% to 5.5% which increased the discounted value of accrued defined benefit obligations, partially offset by the adoption of slightly reduced pensioner life expectancy based on the S1 CMI 2009 projection model mortality tables.

23 Financial risk management The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
It is the role of the Group treasury function to manage and monitor the Groups financial risks and internal and external funding requirements in support of the Groups corporate objectives.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the Finance and Administration Committee.
In particular, the Board of directors or, through delegated authority, the Finance and Administration Committee, approves any derivative transactions.
Derivative transactions are only undertaken for the purposes of managing interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor liquidity, currency, credit and financial risks.
The Group reports in pounds sterling and pays dividends in pounds sterling.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to interest rate and currency risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored on a continuous basis and managed, where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps whereas the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk is considered on an individual non-trading transaction basis.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk or equity price risk as defined in IFRS 7.
Interest rate risk Management of fixed and variable rate debt The Group has fixed and variable rate debt in issue with 58% of the drawn debt at a fixed rate as at 30 April 2010.
The Groups accounting policy requires all borrowings to be held at amortised cost.
As a result the carrying value of fixed rate debt is unaffected by changes in credit conditions in the debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups debt that bears interest at a variable rate comprises all outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility.
The interest rates currently applicable to this variable rate debt are LIBOR as applicable to the currency borrowed US dollars or pounds sterling plus 350bp on the extended revolver borrowings, LIBOR plus 200bp on the non-extended revolver borrowings and LIBOR plus 175bp on the term borrowings.
The Group periodically utilises interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates.
However, during the year ended and as at 30 April 2010, the Group had no such outstanding swap agreements.
The Group also may at times hold cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at a variable rate.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity At 30 April 2010, based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding, the Groups pre-tax profits would change by approximately 4m for each one percentage point change in interest rates applicable to the variable rate debt and, after tax effects, equity would change by approximately 2m.
The amount of the Groups variable rate debt may fluctuate as a result of changes in the amount of debt outstanding under the revolving tranches of the senior secured credit facility.
Currency exchange risk Currency exchange risk is limited to translation risk as there are no transactions in the ordinary course of business that take place between foreign entities.
The Groups reporting currency is the pound sterling.
However, a majority of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs is denominated in US dollars.
The Group has arranged its financing such that, at 30 April 2010, virtually all of its debt was denominated in US dollars so that there is a natural partial offset between its dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and its dollar-denominated debt and interest expense.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate movements on trading transactions is relatively limited.
All Group companies invoice revenues in their respective local currency and generally incur expense and purchase assets in their local currency.
Consequently, the Group does not routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of overseas profits into pounds sterling.
Where the Group does hedge, it maintains appropriate hedging documentation.
Foreign exchange risk on significant non-trading transactions e. g. acquisitions is considered on an individual basis.
71 Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates Based upon the level of US operations and of the US dollar-denominated debt balance and US interest rates at 30 April 2010, a 1% change in the US dollar-pound sterling exchange rate would have impacted our pre-tax profits by approximately 40,000 and equity by approximately 2.0m.
At 30 April 2010, the Group had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 2010 2009 m m Cash and cash equivalents 54.8 1.7 Trade and other receivables 134.7 148.3 189.5 150.0 Substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents at 30 April 2010 are deposited with one large UK-based financial institution which is not expected to fail.
The Group has a large number of unrelated customers, serving over 580,000 during the financial year, and does not have any significant credit exposure to any particular customer.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the markets they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across the Group, such as the use of credit reference agencies and the maintenance of credit control functions.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group generates significant free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less replacement capital expenditure net of proceeds of asset disposals, interest paid and tax paid.
This free cash flow is available to the Group to invest in growth capital expenditure, acquisitions and dividend payments or to reduce debt.
In addition to the strong free cash flow from normal trading activities, additional liquidity is available through the Groups ABL facility.
At 30 April 2010, availability under this facility was $537m 351m.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade and other payables which fall due within one year.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.

In order to manage the shortand long-term capital structure, the Group adjusts the amount of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, returns capital to shareholders for example, share buy-backs and arranges appropriate financing to fund business investment and mergers and acquisitions.
The Group targets leverage of between 2 to 3 times net debt to EBITDA over the economic cycle.
Fair value of financial instruments Net fair values of derivative financial instruments At 30 April 2010, the Groups embedded prepayment options included within its secured loan notes had a combined fair value of 5.7m 2009: nil.
At 30 April 2010, the Group had no other derivative financial instruments.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities The table below provides a comparison, by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups non-derivative financial assets and liabilities at 30 April 2010.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and includes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

Amendments to IFRS 1, Additional exemptions for first-time adopters was issued on 23 July 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010.
The amendments exempt entities using the full cost method from retrospective application of IFRSs for oil and gas assets.
They also exempt entities with existing leasing contracts from reassessing the classification of those contracts in accordance with IFRIC 4, Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, when the application of local accounting requirements produced the same result.
As the Group has already adopted IFRS, there will be no effect on the Groups results or financial position on adoption.
Amendment to IFRS 1, Limited exemption from comparative IFRS 1 disclosure for first-time adopters was issued on 28 January 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010.
The amendment relieves first-time adopters of IFRSs from providing the additional disclosures introduced by the Amendment to IFRS 7 Improving disclosures about financial instruments in March 2009.
It thereby ensures that first-time adopters benefit from the same transition provisions that Amendments to IFRS 7 provides to current IFRS preparers.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments was issued on 12 November 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.
The IASB has issued this standard as the first step in its project to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories being amortised cost and fair value.
All equity and debt instruments are to be measured at fair value with the exception of a debt instrument being measured at amortised cost if it is being held by the entity to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest.
The requirement to separate embedded derivatives from financial assets within hybrid contracts has been removed with them being classified in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.
Two of the existing three fair value option criteria being loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments measured at amortised cost will become obsolete under this fair value-driven business model.
The EU has currently postponed its endorsement of this standard as its IFRS technical advisory body, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group EFRAG has decided that more time should be taken to consider the output from the entire package of standards that are expected to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments.
The Group is currently assessing the impact and expected timing of adoption of this standard on the Groups results and financial position.
IAS 24 revised Related party disclosures was issued on 12 November 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
The standard has been revised in response to concerns that disclosure requirements and the definition of a related party were too complex and difficult to apply in practice.
These concerns have been addressed by providing a partial exemption for government related entities and providing a revised definition of a related party.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement was issued on 26 November 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
The amendment removes the unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, where it did not permit the recognition of an asset for any surplus arising from voluntary prepayment of minimum funding contributions in respect to future years of service.
This will affect companies that have prepaid or expect to prepay the minimum funding requirement in respect to future employee service, leading to a pension surplus.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments was issued on 26 November 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010.
This IFRIC clarifies the accounting when an entity renegotiates the terms of its debt with the result that the liability is extinguished by the debtor issuing its own equity instruments to the creditor referred to as a debt for equity swap.
It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss when a liability is settled through the issuance of the entitys own equity instruments.
Improvements to IFRSs 2010 was issued in May 2010 and its requirements are effective over a range of dates, with the earliest effective date being for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
This comprises a number of amendments to IFRSs, which resulted from the IASBs annual improvements project.
The Company does not believe the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Company.
