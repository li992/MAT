Global iron ore demand reached record levels by US$6.30 MMBtu in June 2010, supported by higher gas February 2010, driven primarily by the overall steel and iron demand from the industrial sector coupled with unplanned ore re-stocking cycles in developed economies, and continuing supply outages.

July 2009 coincided with a renewed level of confidence in the recovery and an end to re-stocking.
Prices increased through accelerating new building deliveries took their toll pushing the market into over supply and Capesize rates to a low of November 2009 when demand diminished as consumers looked to minimise their year-end inventories.

These markets have been supported by fewer new building deliveries combined with a record grain season in registered strong performance in FY2010 driven by growing steel and alloy production.
