The key data for 2009 on the table above is shown as reported and on a constant currency basis for ease of comparison.
Revenue increased by 9% and, excluding the impact of exchange rates, fuel prices and acquisitions and disposals, the organic revenue increase was 4%.
Underlying operating profi ts of 110.6 million were 10% higher 2009: 100.5 million, as a result of the increased activity across both divisions, further operational improvements and a 3.0 million net pensions curtailment gain in the period, which arose as the result of the benefi t changes to the Groups UK defi ned benefi t pension scheme in March 2010.
The pension gain partly off sets the absence of a 4.6 million profi t realised in 2009 on accelerated engine sales in Engine Repair and Overhaul ERO.
Operating margins for the Group were maintained at 9.3% 2009: 9.3% although on a constant fuel price basis improved by 0.4%.
The net interest charge was 15.2 million 2009: 22.3 million with the reduction over the prior period primarily due to the lower net debt and lower interest rates.
Interest cover improved to 9.8 times 2009: 6.2 times.
Underlying profi t before tax increased by 22% to 95.4 million 2009: 78.2 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 21% to 17.6p 2009: 14.6p.
Our tax rate was broadly maintained at 21.2% 2009: 21.7%.
20 Directors Report Profi t before tax increased by 42% to 85.2 million 2009: 60.0 million due to the increase in underlying profi t before tax outlined above and a reduction in exceptional items to 10.2 million 2009: 18.2 million, of which 4.9 million was non-cash.
Unadjusted earnings per share were 15.2p 2009: 11.4p.
We continued to build on the excellent cash flo w performance in the prior year and strong cash generation in the fi first half of 2010 with cash conversion for the year as a whole of 124% 2009: 179% and free cash fl ow of 115.2 million 2009: 137.5 million.
Despite the increased activity, free cash fl ow in the period included a working capital infl ow of 15.9 million 2009: infl ow 57.9 million.
This was partly as a result of our continuing focus on improving the working capital effi ciency of the Group, but also included a short-term timing benefi t of approximately 13 million.
Capital expenditure increased to 27.8 million 2009: 18.7 million, mainly due to our investment in the PT6T Twin-Pac engine overhaul authorisation for Europe.
The reduction in the interest charge fl owed through into reduced interest payments of 14.7 million, and tax payments were reduced by 9.0 million to 2.6 million 2009: 11.6 million with the prior year including fi final payments in relation to earlier years.
Free cash fl ow in the prior period included a 17.6 million infl ow in relation to the accelerated sale and leaseback of a number of engines by Dallas Airmotive.
The cash dividend payment in the period was reduced to 17.4 million 2009: 21.9 million with a 46% average take-up of the scrip alternative across the two dividends paid in the year.
There was a reduction in net debt of 77.7 million with a net cash infl ow of 89.7 million 2009: 107.2 million and closing net debt was 313.9 million 2009: 391.6 million.
Net debt to EBITDA improved substantially to 2.1 times from 2.8 times at the end of 2009.
Group return on invested capital improved to 9.5% 2009: 8.4% as a result of the improvement in underlying operating profi t and a continued focus on capital discipline.
