An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put forward at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION AND MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT COMMITTEE The Company currently has seven non-executive directors, two of whom were appointed since the year end.
The Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee comprises the whole Board.
Since 1 March 2010, the fee of the Chairman has been 30,000 per annum, that of Mr Niven Chairman of the Audit Committee has been 24,000 per annum and the fees of the other directors have been 20,000 per annum.
Prior to 1 March 2010 the fees were payable at a rate of 25,000 per annum for the Chairman, 18,000 per annum for Mr Niven and 16,000 per annum for the other directors.
The fee increases followed a recommendation of the Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee.
The Board believes that the current fee level is appropriate given the size of the Company and the responsibilities of the directors.
Further details on the duties of the Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee can be found in the Corporate Governance statement on page 26.
POLICY ON DIRECTORS FEES The Boards policy is that the remuneration of non-executive directors should be fair and should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole.
The non-executive directors fees are determined within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association and they are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ending 31 December 2011 and for subsequent years.
The maximum level of fees payable, in aggregate, to the directors of the Company is currently 150,000 per annum.
DIRECTORS SERVICE CONTRACTS The directors do not have service contracts with the Company and no director is entitled to compensation on loss of office.
The directors have appointment letters which do not state any specific term.
However, they are subject to re-election by shareholders at a maximum interval of three years.
