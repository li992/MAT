FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RISK PROFILE Market Risks The potential market risks are i currency risk, ii interest risk, and iii other price risk.
Each considered in turn below.
i Currency Risk The Company invests in global equity markets and therefore is exposed to currency risks as it affects the value of the shares in the base currency.
These currency exposures are not hedged.
Currency exposures for the Company as at 31 December 2010 are detailed in the table at the end of this note.
ii Interest Rate Risk The Company is typically fully invested in global equities but will from time to time hold interest bearing assets.
These assets are cash balances that earn interest at a floating rate and UK Treasury Bills when large amounts of cash are held.
At the year end the Companys only interest bearing investment was STE Clean Recycling and Energy but a very limited amount of income is receivable on this investment.
The Company does not have interest bearing liabilities.
iii Other Price Risk The principal price risk for the Company is the price volatility of shares that are owned by the Company.
The Company is well diversified across different sub-sectors and geographies and has a volatility level similar to global stock market indices such as the MSCI World Index to which the Company has an expected tracking error of 9.5%.
The historic 3-year annualised volatility of the Company to 31 December 2010 is 25.4%.
Overall Sensitivity The Manager has used the value at risk VAR methodology in UBS PAS a proprietary investment banking model to estimate the maximum expected loss from the portfolio held at 31 December 2010 over 1 day, 5 day, 10 day and 21 day time periods given the historical performance of the fund over the previous five years.
The data in the previous five years is analysed under discrete periods to provide 1 in 10, 1 in 20 and 1 in 100 possible outcomes.
The results of the analysis are shown below.
Expected loss as percentage at limit 1 in 10 90% 1 in 20 95% 1 in 100 99% 1 day return 1.2 1.9 3.5 5 day return 3.4 4.8 7.9 10 day return 4.9 7.1 12.2 21 day return 6.4 9.5 23.3 The above analysis has been based on the following main assumptions: The distribution of share price returns will be the same in the future as they were in the past.
The portfolio weightings will remain as they were at 31 December 2010.
The above results suggest, for example, that there is a 5% or less chance of the NAV falling by 4.8% or more over a 5 day period.
Similarly, there is a 1% or less chance of the NAV falling by 3.5% or more on any given day.
Credit Risk Cash at bank at 31 December 2010 included 4,157,000 2009: 6,902,000 held at the Companys custodian, The Northern Trust Company.
The Company also held 10,632,000 2009: 476,000 at Lloyds TSB Bank plc.
The Board has established guidelines that, under normal circumstances, the maximum level of cash to be held at any one bank should be the lower of i 5% of the Companys net assets and ii 15 million.
These are guidelines and there may be instances when this amount is exceeded for short periods of time.
Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be low as trading is almost always done on a delivery versus payment basis.
There is a significant credit risk on the unquoted interest bearing investment in STE Clean Recycling and Energy which was valued at 703,000 at the year.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company are held by The Northern Trust Company the Custodian or sub-custodians of the Custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Custodian or its sub-custodians may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the Custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Custodian segregates the Companys assets from its own assets and only uses sub-custodians on its approved list of sub-custodians.
The Company invests in broker issued participatory notes to provide economic exposure to underlying shares or securities when it is impracticable to invest directly in those shares or securities.
The Company may be exposed to risk of loss in the event of default or insolvency of any counter-party used to acquire such investments.
The Board has set a maximum limit for investment through participatory notes at 5% of net asset value, subject to a further limit of 2% per broker both limits at time of investment.
