176 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2010 Ore reserves And MinerAl resOurces coPPEr estimates as at 31 December 2010 COPPEr The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.

1 los Bronces : The sub-product estimated grade for molybdenum is 0.014% for the total Ore Reserves quoted, while the average estimated grade for Mineral Resources is 0.007%.
2 los Bronces sulphide Flotation : The decrease in Ore Reserves is the result of changes to the pit design, in response to restrictions imposed by mining permits, as well as variable changes to slope angles driven by geotechnical and operational considerations.
This subsequently resulted in material being re-allocated from Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources.
3 los Bronces sulphide dump leach : Both Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources were reduced based on a change in the modelled sulphate boundary due to new information.
4 el soldado sulphide Flotation : The gain in Ore Reserves was primarily driven by the increase in copper price, adding phase 6 to the Filo area of the mine.
The decrease in Mineral Resources was driven by the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.
5 el soldado Oxide Heap leach : The decrease in Ore Reserves is primarily due to production with transfer of mixed oxide material to the sulphide process contributing to the rest of the decrease.
6 Mantos Blancos sulphide Flotation : The increase was primarily due to the addition of Phase 17 resulting from benefits associated with higher metal prices and stripping benefit associated with the development of the Mercedes Dump Leach project.
7 Mantos Blancos Oxide vat and Heap leach : The decrease in Ore Reserves is predominantly a result of production depletion and a change in the cut-off grade strategy driven by costs.
Thedecrease in Mineral Resources was driven by conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves in the Mercedes Dump Leach project area.
8 Mantos Blancos Oxide dump leach : The increase in Ore Reserves was driven by the conversion of Mineral Resources from the Mercedes Dump Leach area and the change in the life-of-mine plan to re-process old Vat and Heap-Leach tailings.
The increase in Mineral Resources was based on new material introduced from the phase II area of the Mercedes Dump.
9 Mantoverde Oxide Heap leach : The increase in Ore Reserves was due to new mine designs driven by higher copper prices, lowering of the cut-off grades and a reduction in the carbonate restriction for Heap material, resulting in the addition of several new phases and satellite pits.
The decrease in Mineral Resources was primarily due to conversion to Ore Reserves.
10 Mantoverde Oxide dump leach : The significant increase in Ore Reserves is a result of new pit designs driven by higher copper prices in conjunction with lower cut-off grades supported by operational performance.
11 collahuasi: The increase in Ore Reserves was primarily driven by the increase in metal prices coupled with new drilling information Rosario and the lowering of the breakeven cut-off grade for sulphide ore feed 0.4% to 0.34%TCu.
Significant increases in sulphide Mineral Resources were due to new drilling information Rosario West as a primary factor and higher metal prices coupled with the change in cut-off grade as a secondary factor.
The sub-product estimated grade for molybdenum is 0.022% for Ore Reserves, while the average estimated grade for Mineral Resources is 0.024%.
12 collahuasi Oxide and Mixed: Increase in Oxide reserves was driven by higher metal prices and new drilling information from the Dulcinea and La Borracha pits.
The previously reported Secondary Sulphides have been re-allocated to Mineral Deposit due to uneconomic metallurgical recoveries.
13 copper resources: A test of reasonable eventual economic extraction is applied through consideration of an optimised pit shell.
Materials outside the optimised shell that have potential of eventual economic extraction via underground means are included in the Mineral Resource statement.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statements were carried out by independent consultants during 2010 at the following operations: Los Bronces, El Soldado, Mantos Blancos, Mantoverde and Collahuasi.

Mining method: OP Open Pit, UG Underground.
1 Quellaveco: New drilling information resulted in improvements in the proportion of Proven and Probable Ore Reserves.
While there was no significant increase in Ore Reserves, the use of higher metal prices for the determination of the resource pit resulted in a significant increase in Mineral Resources.
The sub-product estimated grade for molybdenum is 0.019% for Ore Reserves, while the average estimated grade for Mineral Resources is 0.016%.
Due to a rounding error on average grades reported in 2009, a correction of -12kt in contained metal was necessary for the 2009 Ore Reserves.
This resulted in a small change in the average grade reported for 2009 Ore Reserves from 0.65% to 0.64% TCu.
2 Mantoverde sulphide Project: New drilling information significantly improved the proportion of Measured and Indicated category material, while a change in the copper price also increased the overall volume of Mineral Resources.
3 Pebble: The Mineral Resources are based on drilling to May 2009 and a block model finalised in December 2009.
Reported Mineral Resources fall within a volume defined by resource price estimates and are based on a cut-off grade of 0.40% CuEq.
Calculation of copper equivalent CuEq is based on long-term metal prices and takes into consideration the recovery of copper, gold and molybdenum.
At a cut-off of 0.60% CuEq the estimate of Measured Resources is 277Mt at 0.40% Cu, 0.42 g t Au, 0.020% Mo while the estimate of Indicated Resources is 3,391Mt at 0.56% Cu, 0.41 g t Au, 0.029% Mo.
4 Pebble co-product estimated grades 2010 Measured : Gold 0.36g t, Molybdenum 0.018%.
5 Pebble co-product estimated grades 2010 indicated : Gold 0.36g t, Molybdenum 0.027%.
6 Pebble co-product estimated grades 2010 inferred : Gold 0.30g t, Molybdenum 0.026%.
7 Pebble: The property comprises a continuous block of 1,335 located Alaska State mineral claims which total 98,000 acres 39,659 hectares and which are currently valid.
There are no known factors affecting the claims.
8 los sulfatos: The 2010 work programme focused on development of Tunel Sur, an 8km tunnel that will provide underground access for resource drilling.
Drilling is planned to commence during 2012.
The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
9 san enrique Monolito: Exploration drilling during 2010 focused on the confirmation of extension at depth for the underground resource.
10 West Wall: Exploration in 2010 focused on in-fill drilling of the Lagunillas sector of the project.
The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an open pit operation to a depth of 600m below surface.
Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statements were carried out by independent consultants during 2010 at the following projects: Quellaveco, Mantoverde Sulphide Project and Pebble.
