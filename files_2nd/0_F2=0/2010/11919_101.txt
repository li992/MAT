This perpetuity growth rate is a conservative rate and is considered to be lower than the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates and the long-term growth rate prospects of the sectors in which the CGU operates.
Cash flow growth rates The cash flow growth rates are derived from managements latest forecast of sales taking into consideration experience of operating margins achieved in the CGU.
Historically, such forecasts have been reasonably accurate.
sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in assumptions used, most notably the discount rates, the perpetuity growth rates and expected future cash flows.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions is unlikely to cause an impairment in any of the CGUs.
