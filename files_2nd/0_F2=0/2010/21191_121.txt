Share ownership requirements An internal shareholding requirement was introduced in 2005 that the group chief executive and any ED should build, over a five-year period, a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 175% of basic salary and 150% of basic salary respectively and no specific value per share was designated for the calculation.
As outlined in section 2, the shareholding requirement in 2011 is increasing to 200% for the Group Chief Executive.
In addition, the EDs will be required to retain 50% of the net share releases from the deferred annual bonuses and LTIPs until the shareholding requirements have been reached, which will not have a target date.
Shares held in compulsory bonus deferrals and performance shares held in unvested LTIPs are not taken into account in applying this test.
Table 18 shows the position at 31 December 2010, based on that days closing middle market price of an ordinary share of the Company of 393 pence.
Table 18: EDs share ownership requirements Shareholding excluding restricted Basic salary shares Value of shareholding Percentage of basic salary Shareholding requirement 1 Andrew Moss 925,000 326,460 1,282,988 139% 175% 2 Patrick Regan 600,000 0% 150% 2 Mark Hodges 600,000 183,155 719,799 120% 150% 3 Andrea Moneta 780,000 394 1,548 0% N A Notes 1.
Andrew Moss did not meet the internal shareholding requirement target of 150% of salary by April 2010, although he is on target to meet 175% of salary by July 2012 through the vesting of share awards.
Patrick Regan and Mark Hodges are on target to meet 150% of salary by their target dates through the vesting of share awards.
Andrea Moneta resigned from the Board on 19 January 2011 and therefore no longer has any share ownership requirements.
External Board appointments Aviva recognises its EDs can benefit from serving in a personal capacity as a NED of non-Aviva Group companies.
It is, at the same time, conscious of the corporate governance recommendations that EDs should take account of the time commitment required by a NED position and ensure any such role does not impact their ability to carry out fully their executive duties.
The Company therefore has a policy of normally allowing senior executives to serve as a NED of one external company, subject to approval by the Board, and to retain any board fees.
The only ED who held an external NED appointment during 2010 was Philip Scott, who was appointed to the board of Diageo plc on 17 October 2007 and, following the announcement of his intended retirement from the Company, to the board of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc on 1 November 2009.
As a NED of Diageo plc, Mr Scott received fees totalling 10,274 in the period from 1 January 2010 until his retirement from the Aviva plc Board on 26 January 2010.
As a NED of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, Mr Scott received fees totalling 6,849 in the period from 1 January 2010 until his retirement from the Aviva plc Board on 26 January 2010.
All employee share plans EDs are eligible to participate in a number of HMRC approved all employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees.
These plans include a free share element of the Aviva All Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP.
Under this element of the plan, eligible employees can receive up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum in shares based upon the profits of the Companys UK businesses.
The shares are free of tax subject to a retention period.
Free shares were not awarded in 2010.
In addition, the partnership element of the AESOP, which the Company also operates, allows participants to invest up to 125 per month out of their gross salary in the Companys shares.
There is no matching to this investment by the Company.
Shares awarded to, or investments made by, EDs through the AESOP are included in Table 24 below.
The Aviva Savings Related Share Option Scheme allows eligible employees to acquire options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market value at the date of grant.
In order to exercise these options, participants must have saved through a three-, fiveor seven-year HMRC approved savings contract, subject to a maximum savings limit of 250 per month.
Details of options granted to EDs under this scheme can be found in Table 16 above.
Dilution Awards granted under the Aviva employee shares plans are met by the funding of an employee trust administered by an external trustee that acquires shares in the market.
The current practice is that new issue shares will generally only be issued where it is not practicable to use the trust and the funding policy is kept under review by the committee and the Board.
Details of the shares currently held in the employee trust are set out in note 30 to the accounts.
During 2010 loans totalling 13.9 million were made to RBC Trustees CI Limited to ensure sufficient shares were available to meet its ongoing liabilities.
