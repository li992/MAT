com annualreport10 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31st December 2010 continued 42 Reclassication of financial assets held for trading Prior to 2010, the Group reclassied certain financial assets, originally classied as held for trading that were deemed to be not held for trading purposes, and thus considered as loans and receivables.
There were no additional reclassications of financial assets during 2010.
The carrying value of the securities previously reclassied into loans and receivables has decreased from 9,378m to 8,625m as a result of sales, paydowns and maturities of the underlying securities, offset by foreign exchange movements and increases due to reversal of the discount on reclassication.
Sales of securities from the 16th December 2008 reclassication totalled 390m 2009: 1,280m and sales of securities from the 25th November 2009 reclassication totalled 178m 2009: nil.
The following table provides a summary of the assets reclassied from held for trading to loans and receivables.
