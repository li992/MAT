Included within the provision is 199,000 in respect of possible recourse on leases transferred to the purchaser on the sale of the Belgian operation.
The key area of uncertainty relates to the net future rental costs to be incurred on closed shops and, in particular, whether the shops can be sublet until lease exit.
The provision assumes that subletting is unlikely in the current climate.
The provision is expected to be substantially utilised within three years such that the impact of discounting would not be material.
