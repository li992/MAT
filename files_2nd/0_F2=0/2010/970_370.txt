None of these credits expire within five years.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures, where the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures is represented by the contribution of those investments to the Groups retained earnings and amounted to $20,277 million 2009: $16,843 million.
RetiRement benefits The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for the majority of its employees.
It also operates post employment medical arrangements in southern Africa.
In 2009 plans in North America related to businesses which were disposed of in 2010.
Defined contribution plans The defined contribution pension and medical cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
At 31 December 2010 there were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions and so no accrual or prepayment has been disclosed in the balance sheet in relation to these plans.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
The charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans net of amounts capitalised was $216million 2009: $172 million and for defined contribution medical plans net of amounts capitalised was $23million 2009: $18 million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world.
The unfunded pension plans are principally in South America.
The post employment medical arrangements provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded.
The Groups provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff has not significantly impacted the post employment medical plan liability.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every three years using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31December 2010.

2 The long term expected return on plan assets has been set with reference to current market yields on government and corporate bonds and expected equity bond-outperformance in the relevant jurisdictions.
The expected return on cash assets has been set with reference to expected bank base rates.
The overall long term expected rate of return for each class is weighted by the asset allocation to the class at the balance sheet date.
