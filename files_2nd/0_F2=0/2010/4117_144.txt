the Groups financial liabilities are denominated in sterling.
the proportion of the Groups net assets denominated in foreign currencies is immaterial.
the Groups other financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
PAGe 83 | CRANSWICK plc RePoRt & ACCoUnts 2010 Credit risk the Group makes a significant proportion of its sales to the major UK supermarket groups, which correspondingly represent a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables at any one time.
Based on the financial strength of these customers, the Directors do not consider that the Group faces a significant credit risk in this regard.
All cash financial assets are held by UK financial institutions.
the maximum credit exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.
Fair value hierarchy the Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
the Groups assets and liabilities measured at fair value, comprising the interest rate swap and forward currency contracts, are all measured using Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
the Groups 5.5% retained shareholding in Cranswick Pet & Aquatics Limited described in note 9 would have been classified as level 3, however as the investment is an unquoted entity and cannot be reliably measured the Directors consider that its value is immaterial and no fair value has been applied.
Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arms length basis.
the fair value of floating rate assets and liabilities is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
All derivative financial instruments are shown on the balance sheet at fair value.
Details of these financial assets and liabilities are included in notes 18 and 20.
Hedges Financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are held at fair value in the balance sheet.
the Group hedges two types of cash flows: i Forward contracts to hedge expected future purchases the Group hedges a proportion of its near-term expected purchases denominated in overseas currencies.
Where these hedges meet the hedge criteria of iAs 39 changes in fair value are posted directly to equity and subsequently reclassified through the income statement at the time that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Group Currency Amount Maturities Exchange rates Fair value 000 euros euros 14,750,000 12 April 2010 to 1.09 1.15 263 22 september 2010 these contracts were effective cash flow hedges under the criteria set out in iAs 39 and therefore these fair value gains were recognised directly in equity.
the Company does not hold any forward contracts.
ii Interest rate swaps the Group hedges a proportion of the interest cash flows payable in respect of bank loans.
Interest rate swap 1 note 19 Under the terms of this interest rate swap relating to the Groups previous bank facilities, which have now been repaid the Group received LiBoR interest and paid fixed interest of 4.98 per cent.
the notional principal amount of the swap stood at 9,000,000 as at 31 march 2009 and reduced in equal semi-annual instalments of 4,500,000 to nil by January 2010. the swap was an ineffective cash flow hedge under the criteria set out in iAs 39 and therefore movements in fair value have been posted to the income statement.
PAGe 85 | CRANSWICK plc RePoRt & ACCoUnts 2010 Interest rate swap 2 note 19 Under the terms of this interest rate swap relating to the Groups current bank facilities the Group receives LiBoR interest and pays fixed interest of 2.04 per cent.
the notional principal amount of the swap stands at 26,750,000 as at 31 march 2010 and reduces in equal quarterly instalments of 1,750,000 with a final notional payment of principal of 16,250,000 in December 2011. the swap was an effective cash flow hedge under the criteria set out in iAs 39 and therefore movements in fair value have been posted directly to equity and reclassified through the income statement, in finance costs, at the time the hedged item affects the income statement.
Interest rate risk the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
there is no material impact on the Groups equity.
Currency derivatives have not been included in the sensitivity analysis below as they are not considered to be exposed to interest rate risk.
