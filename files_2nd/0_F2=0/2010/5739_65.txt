PROVISION FOR DECOMMISSIONING As at 31 December 2010 2009 $000 $000 Balance at the beginning of the year 2,704 - Acquisition of Exillon WS and Exillon TP - 2,173 Additions 2,140 54 Change in estimates 1,105 91 Unwinding of the present value discount Note 17 168 188 Translation difference 42 198 Balance at the end of the year 3,949 2,704 In accordance with the licence agreements the Group is liable for site restoration, clean up and abandonment of the wells upon completion of their production cycle.
The provision for future site restoration relates to obligations to restore the oilfields after use.
All of these costs are expected to be incurred at the end of the life of wells after 2027.
They depend on the estimated lives of the wells, the scale of any possible contamination and the timing and extent of corrective actions.
The summary of the key assumptions on which the discounted carrying amount of the obligation is based is provided in the Note 5 to these consolidated financial statements.
The unwinding of the discount related to future site restoration and abandonment reserve is included within finance costs.
The management believes that this estimate of the future liability is appropriate to the size of the fields.
