10 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per share for the year ended 31 January 2010 is based on the profit after taxation of 60,467,009 2009: 83,650,000.
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on a weighted average number of 346,512,537 2009: 345,895,311 shares in issue during the year.
The number of shares used in these calculations and the reconciliation of denominators used for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations is set out in the table below: Effect of Basic share options Diluted Year ended 31 January 2010 346,512,537 677,327 347,189,864 Year ended 31 January 2009 345,895,311 1,128,717 347,024,028 Additional disclosure has been provided in respect of earnings per share before non-recurring costs as the directors believe this gives a better view of ongoing maintainable earnings in the prior year.

The related depreciation charge for the year was 893,736 2009: 579,056.
The main finance leases are for EPOS equipment.

Press forward The GAME Group plc 98 Annual Report & Accounts 2009-2010 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January 2010 12 Intangible fixed assets continued The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The growth rates are based on industry forecasts, changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for no more than 13 years using a steady growth rate applicable to the relevant market.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The cash flows were discounted using pre-tax discount rates between 3 per cent and 8 per cent dependent on the territories concerned and GAMEs operations in those territories.
No impairments were recognised in the year.
To cause the carrying value of any of the Groups business units to exceed their recoverable amount would require material and significant adverse changes in one or a number of the assumptions made.
The Board do not consider these to be reasonably possible changes.
13 Inventories 2010 2009 000 000 Finished goods and goods held for resale 176,045 181,965 The Directors consider that the replacement value of inventories is not materially different from their carrying value.

GAME bears no risk of recovery and as a result, the risk of impairment of accounts receivable is not considered by the Directors to be significant.
As at 31 January 2010 and 31 January 2009 there were no amounts which were past due and no amounts which were impaired.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are the same as book values as credit risk has been addressed as part of impairment provisioning and due to the short-term nature of the amounts receivable they are not subject to other fluctuations in market rates.

Book values approximate to fair value at 31 January 2010 and 31 January 2009 due to the short-term nature of these items and taking into account the credit risk of the Group.
The difference between the book and fair values is not considered to be material.

The directors review any requirement for interest rate hedging during the year dependent upon the level of borrowings.
a Interest rate and currency of borrowings The currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups borrowings is shown below: 2010 2009 000 000 Floating rate Euro borrowings 1,128 2,131 Floating rate Sterling borrowings 40,141 56,041 41,269 58,172 The floating rate borrowings comprise bank borrowings and finance leases bearing interest rates based upon LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The Group holds a Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 125 million to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes.
As at 31 January 2010 an amount of nil 2009: nil was drawn down for use in Spain.
The interest rate on the RCF is based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The floating rate sterling borrowings comprise a 41.7 million Term Loan taken out in order to refinance the existing debt at GAME.
The interest rate on the loan is based on LIBOR.
The second repayment is due in July 2010 and four further instalments are due.
The terms of the loan facility indicates a fixed charge over the freehold property and a floating charge over assets.
b Interest rate and currency of cash balances The currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups floating rate cash balances is shown below: 2010 2009 000 000 Sterling 45,500 109,254 Euro 26,783 21,765 Swedish Krona 4,473 3,377 Danish Krone 229 624 Norwegian Krone 806 1,115 Australian Dollar 7,447 3,157 Czech Koruna 890 322 86,128 139,614 The floating rate assets comprise bank accounts bearing interest rates based upon LIBOR and EURIBOR.

Press forward The GAME Group plc 102 Annual Report & Accounts 2009-2010 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January 2010 17 Financial instruments continued c Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated, for example, a change in interest rate and a change in foreign currency interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis prepared by management for foreign currency risk and interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
At 31 January 2010, if interest rates on the floating rate borrowings denominated in sterling had been 100 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the period would be 1,131,051 lower 2009: 1,137,427 lower.
At 31 January 2010, if interest rates on the floating rate borrowings denominated in euros had been 100 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the period would be 271,576 lower 2009: 145,682 lower.
The directors consider that 100 basis points is the maximum likely change to Sterling and Euro interest rates over the next year, being the period up to the next point at which the Group expects to make these disclosures.
The tables in a and b above present financial liabilities and assets denominated in foreign currencies held by the Group in 2010 and 2009.
If the Euro weakened or strengthened by 10 per cent against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, profit after tax and equity would reduce by 331,991 2009: reduce by 850,255. d Fair value of borrowings and financial assets Set out below is an analysis of all the Groups borrowings and financial assets by category.
The fair value of floating rate borrowings is the amortised cost because the interest rate payments are based on market value.
2010 2009 000 000 Trade and other receivables 29,156 38,327 Net cash and cash equivalents 86,128 139,614 Current portion of long-term debt 17,361 26,325 Non current portion of long-term debt 23,908 31,847 The Directors believe that as they are short term, the fair values for all items, other than long-term debt, equate to their book value.
The fair values of both current and non-current bank borrowings are based on cash flows discounted using rates based on the applicable market rate.
The discount rate applied were within the range 3 per cent to 4 per cent 2009: 2 per cent to 3 per cent.
e The Group had no material monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
f As at 30 March 2010, the Group had undrawn working capital facilities available to it of 54.8 million 2009: 32.0 million.
There are no significant conditions attached to these facilities.

27 Risks Global Economic Conditions There is a high degree of uncertainty in the global economy, with issues around government and bank liquidity, business failures, and rising unemployment rates.
We recognise that all of these factors may have an impact on our customers willingness or ability to spend.
Our trading performance to date suggests that compared to some sectors of retailing we are not being as significantly impacted by these wider economic issues.
We will continue to put forward compelling product offers to meet the more value conscious demands of our consumers.
Technology As with music and DVD entertainment, the opportunity exists for pc and video games to be distributed digitally via the internet.
PC games which tend to have smaller file sizes are available from a number of websites whereas video games digital content is offered in a limited way via official format channels, e. g. Microsofts Xbox Live service.
As broadband technology improves there is a risk that more gamers start playing their games online.
This will reduce the number of people buying boxed product from retailers such as ourselves.
Given the ever increasing size of pc and video games up to 50Gb, the existing broadband infrastructure in all of the countries in which we operate is not currently sufficient to allow total online play.
Additionally, we have recognised the increasing prominence of eCommerce and digital downloading and we have invested in state-of-the-art eCommerce websites.
Press forward The GAME Group plc 112 Annual Report & Accounts 2009-2010 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January 2010 27 Risks continued Competition The pc and video games market has become an increasingly attractive proposition for retailers.
We have seen new entrants to the market place, including specialists, existing generalists and supermarkets and online players.
We believe that the specialist has all of the attributes to succeed in the pc and video games market place.
We measure our stores performance against specific KPIs to ensure our proposition is always appealing and relevant to consumers.
Seasonality The Groups business is seasonal with the key trading period being the Christmas season.
Turnover, operating profit and cash flow may be adversely impacted by variations in demand during this period.
The Group works closely with suppliers to secure stock and implement high profile preorder campaigns in advance of all major releases.
The Group also undertakes extensive marketing campaigns to drive consumer awareness, and flexes headcount in store to maximise the sales potential.
Reputation As a specialist retailer our customers demand that we stock the broadest range of product.
This means that we deal with a variety of video games, for example age restricted products.
Mis-selling such titles is illegal.
To mitigate any issues that may arise through the mis-selling of these games, we employ the very highest levels of training throughout our organisation.
