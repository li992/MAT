114 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 NOTES TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2010 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The Directors Report, Corporate Governance and Directors Remuneration Report disclosures have been made in the Group section of this annual report, refer to pages 44 to 61.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
The Company has utilised the exemptions provided under FRS 1 Revised and has not presented a cash flow statement.
The Groups cash flow statement has been presented in the Group financial statements.
In accordance with FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures, the Company is exempt from disclosing transactions with other Group Companies as it is a parent publishing consolidated financial statements.
As the parent company of a group drawing up consolidated financial statements that meet the requirements of IFRS 7, it is exempt from disclosures that comply with its UK GAAP equivalent, FRS 29 Financial Instruments Disclosures.
Employee benefits The retirement benefits for employees are provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from the Company and employees.
The amount charged to profit and loss is the contribution payable in the year.
Share-based payments The Company applies the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
Certain employees receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, including shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the instruments concerned at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
The fair value determined at the Grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit and loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where a parent entity grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, UITF 44 requires the subsidiary to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payment, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, the Company has recognised an addition to fixed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions of 7.3 million 2009: 6.0 million, with a credit to equity for the same amount.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Leased assets Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to income statement over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability and recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis.
115 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all fixed assets to their residual value over their expected useful lives using the straight-line method.
It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets at the following rates: Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10% to 20% per annum or over the period of the lease, if shorter Office furniture, fixtures, equipment and vehicles 10% to 50% per annum Software 20% to 50% per annum Other 10% to 50% per annum The carrying value of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are held in the Company balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Loans Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to profit and loss as incurred using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Companys operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of fixed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Companys financial statements.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise.
Profit for the year As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
Aegis Group plc reported a profit, before the payment of dividends, for the financial year ended 31 December 2010 of 24.0m 2009: 66.3 m. The profit for the year of 24.0m includes dividends received of 77.6 m from group companies.

Derivative financial instruments 2010 2009 m m Current Derivative financial liabilities 2.1 0.1 Non-current Derivative financial assets 8.5 Derivative financial liabilities 13.4 25.0 The derivative financial assets and liabilities represent the fair value of the external and intra-group foreign exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, interest rate swap and cross currency interest rate swaps which are accounted for as fair value through profit and loss.
Cross currency swaps The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents movements in the Euro USD foreign exchange spot rate and in Euro and USD interest rate yields.
The cross currency swaps are synthetically split to reflect the Companys functional currency of Sterling.
The USD Sterling legs of the swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges against the Companys USD loan notes.
The Euro Sterling legs of the swaps have been designated as fair value through profit and loss.
Interest rate swap The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents unrecognised movements which the Company expects to realise as a result of lower or higher variable interest payments under the swap compared with the fixed interest rate applicable on the underlying loan note.
The interest rate swap is designated and effective as fair value hedge against changes in the fair value of the debt caused by changes in interest rates risk.
Movement in the fair value of the interest rate swap is taken to profit and loss where it offsets against similar but opposite movement in the fair value of the debt caused by movement in interest rates.
Cross currency interest rate swaps The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market yield curves applicable and represents movements in the GBP USD foreign exchange spot rate and in GBP and USD interest rate yields.
Movements in the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps excluding the credit spread are taken to profit and loss where they offset against opposite movements in the fair value of the USD loan notes caused by changes in interest rates and foreign exchange spot rates.
Movements in the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps relating to the credit spread are taken to reserves and released to the profit and loss when the underlying portion of USD loan notes interest is recognised in profit and loss.
Details of the fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments are set out in note 19 of the Groups financial statements.
