The fair value of the Groups investment and development properties as at 31 December 2010 was determined by independent external valuers King Sturge for Earls Court & Olympia, and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Groups investment and development property.
The valuation conforms with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Standards, and was arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
Fees paid to valuers are based on xed price contracts.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent or business profitability, taking into account forecast growth rates and yields based on known transactions for similar properties and likely incentives offered to tenants.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
The Groups investment in Seagrave Road, a car park supporting Earls Court, has been valued as a site with development potential.
The exhibition halls at Earls Court & Olympia are fair valued as fully equipped operational entities, having regard to trading potential.
There are certain restrictions on the realisability of investment property when a credit facility is in place.
