4. Business and geographical segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into two distinct business groups, one of these being the provision of mezzanine finance and the other being fund management, which includes mezzanine and credit fund management.
Segment information about these businesses, as reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, is presented below in i and ii : During the year the Group has changed the presentation of internal management reporting information from that presented in the interim financial statements and in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2009, to report the profit of the Fund Management Company FMC, separately from the profits generated by the Investment Company IC.
The FMC is defined as the operating unit and as such carries the bulk of the Groups costs, including the cost of the investment network, i. e. the investment executives and the local offices, as well as the cost of most support functions, primarily Information technology and human resources and marketing.
Previously only the direct costs of the Fund Management business were attributed to that sector.
The IC is charged a management fee of 1 per cent of the carrying value of the investment portfolio by the FMC and this is shown below as Fee income from the Balance Sheet.
The costs of finance, treasury, and portfolio administration teams and the costs related to being a listed entity are allocated to the IC.
The cost of the Medium Term Incentive Scheme, MTIS is charged to the IC, while the scheme remains operational.
The remuneration of the Managing Directors excluding MTIS is allocated equally to the FMC and the IC.
Previously both income and expenses of the IC were reported by geographical segment.
Under the new format, only the mezzanine fund management fee income of the FMC is reported by geographical segment.
Amounts reported for the prior year have been restated to conform to the requirements of IFRS 8. i Analysis of income and profit before tax Mezzanine Fund Management Credit Fund Year ended 31 March 2010 Europe Asia US Management Total FMC IC Total External fund management fee income 26.6 8.0 14.0 48.6 48.6 Fee income from Balance Sheet inter segment 23.4 2.2 1.3 0.9 27.8 27.8 Fund management fee income 50.0 10.2 1.3 14.9 76.4 76.4 209.7 209.7 Net interest income 1.9 1.9 Dividend income Other fee income 3.4 3.4 Staff costs 22.4 2.3 24.7 Medium Term Incentive Scheme 28.9 28.9 Balance Sheet fee income charge 27.8 27.8 inter segment expense Administrative costs 17.9 1.7 19.6 77.1 77.1 Net gains on investments 161.8 161.8 Impairments Add back net fair value gain on derivatives 0.1 0.1 held for hedging purposes Profit before tax 38.0 67.8 105.8 Net gain relating to movements in the fair value of derivatives used to hedge certain liabilities of the Group, excluding any interest accruals and spot F X translation movements on these derivatives, are not considered part of net interest income for segmental reporting.

As these instruments are all held in private companies with no ready market, the events to crystallise such a valuation include the sale of shares to a third party by a substantial shareholder or the approach of an exit to the transaction, either by way of a float or a sale.
Therefore, the fair valuing of such unquoted shares has been restricted to those instruments whose value may be reliably measured, for example by one of the above events.
These instruments are otherwise held at cost.

These estimates take into account the level and quality of the investees earnings, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the investee operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Estimating the quantum and timing of these future proceeds involves significant judgement.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date that they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those recognised in the financial statements.

Share based payments Equity settled share option schemes Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme The Company has a number of share option schemes for certain employees of the Group.
The terms of the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme are shown on page 81.
In July 2009 ICG completed a seven for two rights issue at 121.0p per share.
In accordance with the terms of the ICG PLC 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the ICG PLC 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme all outstanding option exercise prices were adjusted by a factor of 0.414 and the number of all outstanding options were adjusted by a factor of 2.41493.
The purpose of these adjustments was to preserve the rights of the holders after such a capital change.
Share based payments continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in 2009 was 14.16.
The options outstanding at 31 March 2010 have a range of exercise prices between 2.230 and 6.008 following the rights issue adjustment 2009: 6.944 and 15.704 as follows, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.56 years 2009: 7.46 years.
The aggregate of estimated fair values of the options granted on these dates are 2.2m 2009: 6.8m.

The expected life used in the model has been calculated using actual exercise periods over the previous five years.
Key Employee Retention Share Plan KERSP In the year to 31 March 2010, no new shares were granted under the KERSP scheme.
2009: 365,361 shares were granted on 12 June 2008 with an aggregated estimated fair value of 3.9m.
The inputs for the Black-Scholes model for the prior year are as follows: 13 June 2008 Exercise price nil Expected volatility 38.52% Expected life 6.0 years Risk free rate 4.88% Dividend yield 3.90% For shares granted on 13 June 2008, the expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous two years.
20 per cent of the options granted vest in each successive year starting four years from the date granted.
The expected life has thus been calculated by assuming that options are exercised as soon as they vest, there being no exercise cost.
The Group recognised total expenses of 0.6m and 4.2m related to equity settled share based payment transactions in 2010 and 2009 respectively.
Financial commitments At 31 March 2010, the Group estimated that it had no contractual obligations to provide further funding apart from an obligation to lend a further 36.5m 2009: 46.8m on four existing investments and one new investment, and one co-investment agreement with Intermediate Capital Asia Pacific Fund 2008.

Financial assets and liabilities a Treasury and hedging policies The Groups treasury policies seek to manage the following risks.
i Interest rate risk The Groups assets include both fixed and floating rate loans and non interest bearing equity investments.
The Groups operations are financed with a combination of shareholders funds, bank borrowings, private placement notes and floating rate notes.
The Group manages its exposure to market interest rate movements by matching, to the extent possible, the interest profiles of assets and liabilities and by using derivative instruments.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
The sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is disclosed in d, page 121. ii Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of net assets, currency transactions and the translation of net asset, and profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups most significant exposures are to the euro and the US dollar.
The Group manages its exposure to market currency risk by matching assets with debt to the extent possible and through the use of derivative instruments.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.
The financial assets and liabilities by currency and the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to foreign exchange rates is shown in d page 121.
This is before the effect of derivative instruments.
iii Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining headroom on its financing facilities, particularly the bank facilities.
The table below shows the liquidity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, based on contractual repayment dates of principal and interest payments.
Future interest and principal cash flows have been calculated based on exchange rates and floating rate interest rates as at 31 March 2010.
It is assumed that borrowings under the Groups revolving credit facility remains at the level as at 31 March 2010 until contractual maturity.
iv Refinancing risk The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding.
Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets the Group seeks to ensure that the maturity of its debt instruments is matched to the expected maturity of its assets.
This has been achieved by the ongoing private placement programme with notes maturing between five and 10 years, short term borrowings under bank facilities and by issuing floating rate notes.
v Credit risk The Groups policy is to diversify its portfolio in terms of geography, sector and size and has in place disciplined credit procedures both before and during the period of investment to protect its portfolio.
The carrying amount of financial assets before any impairments best represents both the Group and Companys maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
The Group believes that all financial assets that are neither past due or impaired will be recovered in full.
Details on impairments are included in note 15, which sets out the factors the Group considers when determining if a financial asset is impaired.
Additional information on the concentrations of credit risk are provided by industry and country on page 50.

The total carrying amount of these instruments is 266.3m 2009: 221.1m.
The fair value of these warrants and unlisted shares cannot be reliably measured.
The range of estimates within which the aggregate fair value is highly likely to lie is 60m to 100m higher than the carrying value 2009: 55m to 95m.
Apart from the unlisted shares and warrants held at cost, the following methods and assumptions that were used to estimate the fair values are shown below: Accounts Accounts Accounts 119 Accounts 119 27.
Financial assets and liabilities continued Loans and receivables Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered by the Directors to be a good approximation for fair value.
AFS financial assets and warrants fair value is based on quoted prices, where available.
Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is based on recent significant transactions or an earning based valuation technique.
Where a reliable fair value cannot be established, these are held at cost.
Loans and receivables designated as FVTPL The maximum exposure to credit risk of loans and receivables designated as FVTPL is 11.9m 2009: 0.3m.
Of the change in fair value in the period 2.1m 2009: nil is due to changes in credit risk of the asset.
Other derivatives The fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, including maturity, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
The Group has loans and receivables with a conversion option embedded.
Given the low probability of conversion by the Group, the value attributed to these embedded derivatives is nil.
Revolving credit facility, private placements and secured notes Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method.
The fair value of fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on these instruments at current market interest rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Due to their short term nature, the Directors consider the carrying value to be a good approximation of fair value.

Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
