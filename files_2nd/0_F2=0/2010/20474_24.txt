There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent assets deployed in the UK Car Insurance, Price Comparison and Non-UK Car Insurance segments is not allocated in arriving at segment profi ts.
This is consistent with regular management reporting.
Eliminations represent inter-segment funding and balances included in trade and other receivables and other payables.

As described in the accounting policies, the amortisation of this asset ceased on transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
All annual impairment reviews since the transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of the asset is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment losses have been recognised.

Financial assets and liabilities The Groups fi financial instruments can be analysed as follows: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 m m Financial assets: Investments held at fair value 363.6 237.7 Held to maturity deposits with credit institutions 299.6 183.5 Receivables amounts owed by policyholders 341.5 209.7 Total fi financial assets 1,004.7 630.9 Trade and other receivables 47.9 32.7 Cash and cash equivalents 246.7 211.8 1,299.3 875.4 Financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 561.0 306.8 All receivables from policyholders are due within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
All investments held at fair value are invested in AAA-rated money market liquidity funds.
These funds target a short-term cash return with capital security and low volatility and continue to achieve these goals.
The approximate fair value of held to maturity deposits is 285.2 million 2009: 183.5 million based on a calculation to discount expected cash fl ows arising at the Groups WACC.
The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Risk Management Committee RMC and non-UK equivalent Committees.
There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Groups investment strategy.
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group.
These are detailed in full in the Corporate Governance statement.
Specifi c considerations for the risks arising from fi financial assets and liabilities are detailed below.
Credit risk The Group defi fines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations or fails to perform them in a timely fashion.
The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and policyholder receivables.
Economic and fi financial market conditions have led the Directors to consider counterparty exposure more frequently and in signifi cant detail.
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Groups risk appetite, and no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specifi c concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds which invest in a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities.
Cash balances and deposits are placed only with credit institutions with a fi financial strength rating of A or above.
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers, the Group only conducts business with companies of specifi ed fi financial strength ratings.
In addition, most reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk.
The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by instalment payers.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable.
There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous high and low level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2010 is 1,251.4 million 2009: 842.7 million, being the carrying value of fi financial assets and cash.
The Group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure.
The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2010 and 2009 is insignifi cant.
There were no signifi cant fi financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2010 or 2009.
The Groups fi financial instruments can be analysed as follows: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 Rating m m Financial institutions Money market funds AAA 363.6 237.7 Financial institutions Credit institutions AA 252.6 85.0 Financial institutions Credit institutions A 47.0 310.3 Reinsurers A 104.4 96.0 Interest rate risk The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital values of fi financial assets and liabilities.
This relates primarily to investments held at fair value.
As noted above, the Group invests in money market liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of very short dated fi xed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certifi cates of deposits, fl oating rate notes and other commercial paper.
Admiral Group plc | Annual Report 2010 76 The funds are not permitted to have an average maturity greater than 60 days and hence are not subject to large movements in yield and value resulting from changes in market interest rates as longer duration fi xed income portfolios can experience.
Returns are likely to closely track the LIBID benchmark and hence while the Groups investment return will vary according to market interest rates, the capital value of these investment funds will not be impacted by rate movements.
The interest rate risk arising is therefore considered to be minimal.
The Group also holds a number of fi xed rate, longer-term deposits with UK credit institutions rated A or above.
These are classifi ed as held to maturity and valued at amortised cost.
Therefore neither the capital value of the deposits, or the interest return will be impacted by fl uctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defi ned as the risk that the Group does not have suffi cient, available, fi financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
The Group has traditionally been strongly cash generative due to the large proportion of profi t arising from non-underwriting activity.
Further, as noted above, a signifi cant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion of the Group cash and investments are immediately available.
A breakdown of the Groups fi financial liabilities trade and other payables is shown in note 22.
In terms of the maturity profi le of these liabilities, all amounts may potentially mature within three to six months of the balance sheet date except for a minority of fi finance lease liabilities which will expire after 12 months.
Refer to note 23 and the maturity profi le at the start of this note for further details.
In practice, the Groups Directors expect actual cashfl ows to be consistent with this maturity profi le except for amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers.
Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of 327.4 million 2009: 154.4 million, 218.3 million 2009: 91.3 million is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 18.
The maturity profi le for fi financial assets is included at the start of this note.
The Groups Directors believe that the cash fl ows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profi le.
Liquidity risk is not, therefore, considered to be signifi cant.
Foreign exchange risks Foreign exchange risks arise from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of overseas assets.
The Group may be exposed to foreign exchange risk through its expanding operations overseas.
Although the relative size of these operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates result in larger potential gains or losses.
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities, however surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
The Group hedges certain items of foreseen expenditure using forward contracts and similar instruments.
None were outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Fair value The carrying value of all of the Groups fi financial assets equate to fair value.
For, cash at bank and cash deposits, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.
For assets held at fair value through profi t and loss, their value equates to level 1 quoted prices in active markets of the fair value hierarchy specifi ed in the amendment to IFRS 7.
Admiral Group plc | Annual Report 2010 77 Notes to the fi financial statements continued Objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to continue as going concerns and also to ensure that regulated entities comfortably meet regulatory requirements.
Excess capital above these levels within subsidiaries is paid up to the Group holding company in the form of dividends on a regular basis.
The Groups dividend policy is to make distributions after taking into account capital that is required to be held a for regulatory purposes: b to fund expansion activities: and c as a further prudent buffer against unforeseen events.
This policy gives the Directors fl exibility in managing the Groups capital.
Capital continues to be held in equity form, with no debt.
Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities A Objectives, policies and procedures for the management of insurance risk: The Group is involved in issuing motor insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its underwriting partners.
Insurance risk primarily involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued.
The key reserving risk is that the frequency and or value of the claims arising exceeds expectation and the value of insurance liabilities established.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 17, it has delegated the task of supervising risk management to the Risk Management Committee RMC and its overseas equivalents.
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group.
These include underwriting partnership arrangements, pricing policies and claims management and administration policies.
A number of the key elements of these policies and procedures are detailed below: i Co-insurance and reinsurance: As noted in the business review, the Group cedes a signifi cant amount of the motor insurance business generated to external underwriters.
In 2010, 45% of the UK risk was shared under a co-insurance contract, under which the primary risk is borne by the co-insurer.
A further 27.5% was ceded under quota share reinsurance contracts.
As well as these proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
Arrangements outside of the UK are set out in the business review on page 17. ii Data driven pricing: The Groups underwriting philosophy is focused on a sophisticated data-driven approach to pricing and underwriting and on exploiting the competitive advantages direct insurers enjoy over traditional insurers through: Collating and analysing more comprehensive data from customers Tight control over the pricing guidelines in order to target profi table business sectors: and Fast and fl exible responsiveness to data analysis and market trends The Group is committed to establishing premium rates that appropriately price the underwriting risk and exposure.
Rates are set utilising a larger than average number of underwriting criteria.
The Directors believe that there is a strong link between the increase in depth of data that the Group has been able to collate over time and the lower than average historic reported loss ratios enjoyed by the Group.
Admiral Group plc | Annual Report 2010 78 iii Effective claims management: The Group adopts various claims management strategies designed to ensure that claims are paid at an appropriate level and to minimise the expenses associated with claims management.
These include: An effective, computerised workfl ow system which along with the appropriate level of resources employed helps reduce the scope for error and avoids signifi cant backlogs Use of an outbound telephone team to contact third parties aiming to minimise the potential claims costs and to ensure that more third parties utilise the Group approved repairers Use of sophisticated and innovative methods to check for fraudulent claims Concentration of insurance risk: The Directors do not believe there are signifi cant concentrations of insurance risk.
This is because, although the Group only writes one line of insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wide regional base.
B Sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes in assumptions: The following table sets out the impact on equity at 31 December 2010 that would result from a 1% worsening in the UK loss ratios used for each underwriting year for which material amounts remain outstanding.

Whilst an announcement is expected imminently, at the date the fi financial statements were approved the discount rate used in these calculations remained at 2.5%.
Including an allowance for the estimated impact of a signifi cant reduction in the discount rate, the Directors remain satisfi ed that the selected reserves included in the fi financial statements provide an appropriate and consistent margin over projected ultimate loss ratios.

Non-current assets held for sale On 6 January 2011, the Group disclosed that following exclusive discussions, it had sold its German operation, AdmiralDirekt, to Itzehoer Versicherung Itzehoer.
The insurance contracts generated by AdmiralDirekt and underwritten by the Group in 2011 will be fully reinsured by Itzehoer, and it is intended to transfer 2011 and prior year underwriting business to Itzehoer subject to regulatory and court approval.
At the balance sheet date, a disposal group consisting of property, plant and equipment assets belonging to the AdmiralDirekt operation were separately classifi ed as held for sale.
The carrying amount of these assets is lower than the fair value of the assets less costs to sell and therefore no impairment loss has been recognised on the reclassifi cation.
No other assets or liabilities of the AdmiralDirekt operation were included in the sale.
The results of the AdmiralDirekt operation in 2010 are not material to the results of the Group and therefore have not been separately presented.
The results and balances of AdmiralDirekt are included in the Non-UK Car Insurance segment in note 4.

Events after the balance sheet date On 1 March 2011, the European Court of Justice ECJ gave a preliminary ruling that upheld the recommendation that Article 5 2 of the Gender Directive is invalid, due to it being incompatible with the general principle of equal treatment for men and women which is a fundamental principal under EU law.
Article 5 2 of the Gender Directive allowed insurers to use gender related information in determining insurance premiums and benefi ts if insurers can provide statistically valid data that proved gender is a determining risk factor.

The requirement for unisex premiums and benefi ts will come into effect after a transitional period on 21December 2012, by which time the Groups EU insurers will have gender neutral pricing and benefi ts inplace.
