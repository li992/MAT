Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 89 Notes to the accounts 1 CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY, NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS Change in presentation currency Following a period of sustained international growth, the Groups cash flows and economic returns are now principally denominated in US Dollars.
From 1 January 2010, BG Group changed the currency in which it presents its consolidated and parent Company Financial Statements from Pounds Sterling to US Dollars.
A change in presentation currency is a change in accounting policy which is accounted for retrospectively.
Statutory financial information included in the Groups Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31December 2010 previously reported in Pounds Sterling has been restated into US Dollars using the procedures outlined below: assets and liabilities denominated in non-US Dollar currencies were translated into US Dollars at closing rates of exchange.
Non-US Dollar trading results were translated into US Dollars at average rates of exchange.
Differences resulting from the retranslation of the opening net assets and the results for the year have been taken to reserves: the cumulative translation reserve was set to nil at 1 January 2003 i. e. the transition date to IFRS.
All subsequent movements comprising differences on the retranslation of the opening net assets of non-US Dollar subsidiaries have been charged to the translation reserve.
Share capital, share premium and other reserves were translated at the historic rates prevailing at the dates of transactions: and all exchange rates used were extracted from the Groups underlying financial records.
The exchange rates of US Dollar to Pound Sterling over the periods included in this Annual Report and Accounts are as follows: US Dollar Pound Sterling exchange rate 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Closing rate 1.5657 1.6149 1.4378 1.9906 1.9572 Average rate 1.5489 1.5510 1.8934 2.0029 1.8282 The impact of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations on BG Groups Financial Statements for 2010 is set out below.
These did not result in any changes to the Financial Statements of the parent Company.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC issued IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements in November 2006.
Theinterpretation provides guidance on the accounting by operators for public-to-private service concession arrangements and was applicable for the year ended 31December 2010.
IFRIC 12 requires infrastructure considered to be under the control of a regulator rather than an operator to be recognised as an intangible concession asset and amortised over the concession period.
Prior to the adoption of IFRIC 12 such infrastructure was recognised as property, plant and equipment of the operator and depreciated over its useful economic life.
The interpretation also requires additions to the infrastructure incurred by the operator to be accounted for as a construction contract with the regulator, with revenues and associated costs recognised in the income statement on a percentage of completion basis.
The Group has concluded that the Comgs concession in Brazil falls within the scope of the interpretation.
Accordingly, on 1 January 2010 infrastructure which forms part of the transmission and distribution network operated by Comgs of approximately $1.6 billion 1 January 2009 $1.1billion was recognised as intangible assets resulting in a corresponding decrease to property, plant and equipment.
Comparative information has been restated to reflect this arrangement.
The application of this interpretation increased both revenue and operating costs by $148m in 2010 2009 $114m.
There was no impact on net earnings, basic earnings per share or diluted earnings per share.
IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations The International Accounting Standards Board IASB issued IFRS 3 revised in January 2008.
The revised standard introduced changes to the accounting for contingent consideration and transaction costs, as well as allowing an option to calculate goodwill based on the parents share of net assets only or including goodwill relating to non-controlling interests.
The standard was applicable for the year ended 31December 2010 but did not result in any changes to the Groups Financial Statements.
IAS 27 revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements The IASB issued IAS 27 revised in January 2008.
The revisions require the effects of transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity when there is no change in control, and specify the accounting on loss of control.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items The IASB issued an amendment to IAS 39 in July 2008.
The amendment clarifies how the existing principles underlying hedge accounting should be applied in the designation of a one-sided risk in a hedged item and inflation in a financial hedged item.
The amendment was applicable for the year ended 31December 2010 but did not result in any changes to the Groups Financial Statements.
com A year of delivery Financial statements 90 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes to the accounts continued 1 CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY, NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS continued Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 in June 2009.
The amendment clarifies the scope and accounting for group cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the separate or individual financial statements of the entity receiving goods or services when that entity has no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction.
IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners The IFRIC issued IFRIC 17 in November 2008.
The interpretation clarifies how an entity should account for the distribution of non-cash assets when paying dividends to its owners.
This interpretation was applicable for the year ended 31December 2010 but did not result in any changes to the Groups Financial Statements.
Improvements to IFRSs The IASB issued amendments to a number of IFRSs in April 2009 as part of its annual improvement project.
These amendments were applicable for the year ended 31December 2010 but did not result in any changes to the Groups Financial Statements.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and IFRIC up to the date of this report, but have not been adopted by the Group in these Financial Statements and in some cases have not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The IASB issued IFRS 9 in November 2009 and subsequently added to the scope of the standard in October 2010.
The standard introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities and is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
BG Group is currently reviewing the standard to determine the likely impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
IAS 24 revised Related Party Disclosures The IASB issued IAS 24 revised in November 2009.
The revisions provide a partial exemption from the disclosure requirements for governmentrelated entities and simplify the definition of a related party.
The revisions are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 7 in October 2010.
The amendment primarily introduces new disclosure requirements associated with the transfer and securitisation of financial assets.
The revisions are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Improvements to IFRSs The IASB issued amendments to a number of IFRSs in May 2010 as part of its annual improvement project.
These amendments will be adopted by the Group for the year ending 31December 2011 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Other amendments and interpretations Up to the end of 2010, IFRIC issued IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010 and amendments to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
The IASB issued amendments to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010.
These amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS BG Group has important businesses in Tunisia and Egypt.
Recent events in these countries have had no material impact on BG Group and management continues to monitor developments closely.
com BG Group A year of delivery Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 91 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PRESENTATION BG Groups reportable segments are those used by the Groups Board and management the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined in IFRS 8 Operating Segments to run the business and are based on differences in the Groups products and services.
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
BG Groups three principal operating and reporting segments in 2010 comprise Exploration and Production E&P, Liquefied Natural Gas LNG, and Transmission and Distribution T&D.
E&P comprises exploration, development, production and marketing of hydrocarbons with a focus on natural gas.
LNG combines the development and use of LNG import and export facilities with the purchase, shipping and sale of LNG and regasified natural gas.
T&D develops, owns and operates major pipelines, distribution networks and power stations, and supplies natural gas and electricity through these to the end customer.
Other activities primarily comprise costs relating to business development expenditure and certain corporate activities.
Following the disposal of the majority of the Groups Power Generation Power businesses, the Power segment has been treated as discontinued operations.
The Power businesses that remain with BG Group have been allocated to other business segments based on their activity and location.
Comparative information has been restated to reflect the presentation of discontinued operations as a separate line item.
See note 8, page 104, for further details.
In 2010, the operations were structured in four main geographical areas: Europe and Central Asia region: Africa, Middle East and Asia region: Americas and Global LNG region: and Australia region.
Intra-group and inter-segment sales are settled at market prices and are generally based on the same prices as those charged to third parties arms length principle.
Group revenue, profit for the year, non-current assets, net assets, gross assets and gross liabilities, depreciation and amortisation and capital investment attributable to BG Group activities are shown on pages 91 to 94, analysed by operating segment.
Additional information on capital investment is also provided on a regional basis.
The presentation of BG Groups results under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS separately identifies the effect of the remeasurement of certain financial instruments and profits and losses on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets and businesses.
Results excluding discontinued operations and disposals, certain re-measurements and impairments Business Performance are used by management and are presented in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance of the Groups ongoing business.
Further information on Business Performance is given on page 144.
The disposals, re-measurements and impairments column includes unrealised gains and losses in respect of certain long-term UK gas sales contracts classified as derivatives under IAS 39, commodity instruments that represent economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting, and financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure.
The separate presentation of these items best reflects the underlying performance of the business since it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurements under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Under IFRS the results from jointly controlled entities joint ventures and associates are presented net of tax and finance costs on the face of the income statement.
BG Group also presents the operating profit of the Group including results of joint ventures and associates before interest and tax, as this approach provides additional information on the source of the Groups operating profits.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between the overall results and Business Performance and operating profit, including and excluding the results of joint ventures and associates.
The geographical information provided for external revenue is based on destination.

In 2010, 2.0m of these awards were in the form of nil-cost options 2009 1.4m.
The costs in respect of these awards are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the shares at the award date.
In 2010, the charge in respect of Group Share Awards was $26m 2009 $14m.
Dividend equivalents accrue on the award during the vesting period.
Accordingly, the fair value of the shares awarded is based on the weighted average market value of the shares on the award date, which was 10.66 in 2010 2009 10.19.
As at 31 December 2010, total awards of 7.0m shares 2009 4.2m were outstanding, which included nil-cost options over 3.2m shares 2009 1.4m.

In 2010, 2.7m of these awards were in the form of nil-cost options 2009 3.7m.
The costs in respect of these awards are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the shares at the award date, adjusted for the probability of market-related performance conditions being achieved.
In 2010, the charge in respect of Performance Share Awards was $20m 2009 $11m.
The fair value of shares awarded during the year in respect of Performance Share Awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 10.63 2009 10.19, exercise price of nil 2009 nil, a risk-free rate of 0.9% 2009 1.9% and a vesting period of three years 2009 three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group and each member of the industry peer group as set out on page 63 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
The fair value reflects the probability of market performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares awarded during the year was 5.97 per share 2009 4.79 per share.
The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of shares for the Performance Share Awards are based on US data because most of the companies selected as industry peers are US-based.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Share price correlation was determined by calculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historical growth over the previous year.
As at 31 December 2010, total awards of 10.2m shares 2009 7.4m were outstanding, which included nil-cost options over 6.0m shares 2009 3.5m.

The fair value of share options granted during the year was 4.13 per share 2009 4.35 per share.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three-year period.
The expected life used in the model is based on the contractual terms in the Sharesave Plan.
Share Incentive Plan Details of the Share Incentive Plan SIP are given on page 64.

A charge of $nil has been made in respect of cash-settled CSOS awards 2009 $5m, the terms of which are the same as the equity-settled CSOS awards, and a charge of $8m 2009 $9m has been made in respect of social security costs on employee share option and share plans.
During the vesting period, the costs of the cash-settled CSOS awards are charged to the income statement based on the fair value of the share option at the balance sheet date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
The charge to the income statement in respect of social security costs has been calculated based on the fair value of the awards at the balance sheet date multiplied by the current employers social security rate.
The fair value of the awards that had not vested at the balance sheet date has been estimated using the year-end share price or a Black-Scholes option pricing model, where appropriate.
To determine the social security costs in respect of the Performance Share Awards the following assumptions were used: share price of 12.96 2009 11.22, volatility of 43% 2009 43%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 1.02% 2009 1.45% and a weighted average expected life of two years 2009 two years.
The weighted average fair value of Performance Share Awards at the balance sheet date was 6.48 2009 5.31.
For the Group Share Awards, the fair value of the award was based on the market price of the shares at the balance sheet date.

As at 31December 2010, $817m of the goodwill recognised related to Comgs 2009 $778m, which is classified within the T&D segment.
Comgs is defined as a CGU for impairment testing purposes.
No goodwill impairment has been recognised in respect of this CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Comgs CGU is determined from value in use calculations, using cash flow projections based on approved financial plans covering a five-year period.
The projected cash flows are adjusted for associated risks and are discounted using a nominal rate of 8% pre-tax.

c Broadly equivalent to cash flows attributable to investing activities arising from exploration and evaluation.
d Disposals and unsuccessful exploration expenditure includes $382m 2009 $545m in respect of unsuccessful exploration expenditure written off.
The net book value of Other intangible assets as at 1 January 2009 was $6 422m.
Comgs operates under a concession arrangement with the local regulator ARSESP to distribute gas to a number of different market segments in the state of So Paulo, Brazil.
The Comgs concession is a 30 year franchise, with a potential to extend for a further 20 years when the primary concession period ends in 2029.
The arrangements between Comgs and the local regulator are classified as a service concession arrangement in accordance with IFRIC 12.
The regulator reviews the maximum margin that can be charged to each market segment every five years.
Changes to the tariff primarily reflect the economic balance between investments, operating expenses, cost of capital, inflation, efficiency and changes in the cost of gas purchased by Comgs.
At least once a year, the Regulator adjusts the tariff for inflation and gas cost variances.
The current tariff structure covering the period 2009 to 2014 was agreed with the Regulator in 2009.
There were no significant changes to the concession arrangement in 2010.
Under the terms of each tariff review, Comgs commits to a certain level of expenditure necessary to develop and maintain the gas distribution network within the concession area.
Comgs is required to use the network infrastructure to supply gas to industrial, commercial, residential, natural gas vehicle, cogeneration and power customers.
At the end of the concession period, ownership of the infrastructure passes to the Regulator in exchange for consideration based on the residual value.
In accordance with IFRIC 12, which was applicable to the Group for the year ended 31December 2010, all infrastructure associated with the service concession arrangement is recognised as an intangible concession asset with additions to the infrastructure being accounted for as a construction contract with the Regulator.
Comparative information has been restated accordingly.
During the year, additions to infrastructure of $148m 2009 $114m were recognised as revenue.
No profit or loss has been recognised in respect of additions to infrastructure in 2010 or 2009.
Additional information on the adoption of IFRIC 12 can be found in note 1, page 89.

As part of its business operations, the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the composition of floating and fixed rate debt.
The Group enters into currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign currency cash flows and to adjust the currency composition of its assets and liabilities.
Certain agreements are combined foreign currency and interest swap transactions, described as cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy is to enter into interest or exchange rate derivatives only where these are matched by an underlying asset, liability or transaction.
Further information on treasury risks is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 34 to 39.
COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain long-term gas sales contracts in the UK fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts include pricing terms that are based on a variety of commodities and indices.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in other comprehensive income and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet within Other commodity derivatives at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 34 to 39.

The amounts in respect of other commodity derivatives represent the gross combination of notional principals relating to all purchase and sale contracts and accordingly do not show the extent to which these contracts may offset.
These notional principal amounts give an indication of the scale of derivatives held, but do not reflect the risks that the Group is exposed to from their use.
VALUATION All financial instruments that are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value have been classified in accordance with the hierarchy described in IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Fair value measurement hierarchy The fair value hierarchy, described below, reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived directly from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those including inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability directly or indirectly.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate and currency exchange rate derivatives and the majority of the Groups commodity derivatives are calculated from relevant market prices and yield curves at the balance sheet date and are therefore based solely on observable price information.
These instruments are not directly quoted in active markets and are accordingly classified as Level 2 in the fair valuehierarchy.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Where observable market valuations of commodity contracts are unavailable, the fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price and is subsequently determined using the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
Due to the assumptions underlying their fair value, certain long-term UK gas contracts are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
One of the assumptions used for their valuation is that the gas market in the UK is liquid for four years 2009 two years.
As at 31December 2010, the average four-year forward price for UK gas was 61p per therm 2009 average two-year forward price of 42p per therm.
Beyond this period a seasonally adjusted UK gas price of 45p per therm 2009 45p per therm has been used, along with an electricity price of 45 per megawatt hour 2009 45 per megawatt hour, subject to annual inflation of 2.0%.
The fair values of the long-term commodity contracts are then calculated using the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Using these assumptions, the change in fair value of long-term UK gas contracts charged to the income statement in the year was $132m 2009 $73m credit.
com BG Group A year of delivery Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 115 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued As at 31December 2010, the potential change in the fair value of long-term UK commodity contracts, assuming changes in the price assumptions of gas 15p per therm, Brent $10 per bbl and electricity 15 per megawatt hour, was $4m 2009 $116m.

One of the assumptions underlying the valuation of long-term UK gas contracts is the liquidity in the UK gas market.
Following a period of increased activity, the assumed period of liquidity in the UK gas market as at 31December 2010 was increased from two years to four years, resulting in a transfer of $406m of financial liabilities from Level 3 to Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Total gains or losses recognised in profit or loss are presented in other operating income.
All of the gains or losses for the period are related to financial assets and liabilities held at 31December 2010.
All of the gains or losses for the period ended 31December 2009 related to financial assets and liabilities held at 31December 2009.
A reasonably foreseeable change in the valuation assumptions underlying other commodity derivatives classified as Level 3 would not significantly change their fair value measurement.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING In line with the Groups risk management policies, certain derivative and non-derivative instruments are designated as hedges of currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures in accordance with IAS 39.
Further information can be found in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 34 to 39.
Fair value hedges As at 31December 2010, the Group held a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
The Group also held a number of commodity derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with fixed price firm sales commitments.
The hedged items and the related derivatives have the same critical terms to ensure that they are an effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31December 2010 is $ 27 m 2009 $5m.
During 2010, adjustments of $20m 2009 $ 57 m have been made to hedged items in respect of the risks being hedged.
Cash flow hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts, currency exchange rate derivatives and interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales, and of interest flows on floating rate debt.
As at 31December 2010, an unrealised pre-tax loss of $564m 2009 $179m gain was deferred in other comprehensive income in respect of effective cash flow hedges.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within 27 years 2009 28 years and the associated gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income will be released to the income statement as the underlying transaction crystallises.
As at 31December 2010, deferred pre-tax losses of $507m 2009 $284m gains are expected to be released to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as at 31December 2010 is $ 798 m 2009 $ 357 m : these amounts exclude dedesignated cash flow hedges.
During 2010, certain forecast commodity sales for which cash flow hedge accounting was used were no longer expected to occur.
This resulted in the transfer of an unrealised pre-tax gain of $42m 2009 $71m from other comprehensive income to the income statement.
Page 84 identifies the amounts that have been transferred from other comprehensive income in respect of transactions completed during the year.
These items are reported within the income statement or non-current assets to match against the underlying transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 31December 2010, certain borrowings and currency derivatives have been designated as hedges of the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations.
The portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments determined to be an effective hedge are transferred to other comprehensive income to offset the gains or losses arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax loss on effective hedging instruments deferred within other comprehensive income as at 31December 2010 is $138m 2009 $158m.
The fair value of financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding as at 31December 2010 is $1 924m 2009 $730m.

The fair values of the fixed rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans have been estimated based on quoted market prices where available, or by discounting all future cash flows by the relevant market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans approximate book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associates as repayment of these loans is linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associate and other considerations and it is therefore not practicable to assign fair values.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The principal financial risks arising from financial instruments are commodity price risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit and liquidity risk.
A description of these principal risks is outlined in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 34 to 39.
Additional quantitative information and market sensitivities in relation to certain principal market risks are included in the section below.
Liquidity risk The Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures keep liquidity risk low.
The Group proposes to meet its financial commitments from both the operating cash flows of the business and from use of the money and capital markets, including existing committed lines of credit.

com BG Group A year of delivery Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 119 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures of commercial counterparties including exposures in respect of outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A are normally accepted as a counterparty, and credit limits are established based on credit ratings and other assessment factors.
If a commercial counterparty is independently credit rated, the rating is used to determine credit quality and limits.
If there is no independent credit rating, credit quality is assessed in accordance with credit policies which take account of the counterpartys financial position and other factors.
Exposures are monitored by the relevant Group businesses and at a consolidated Group level.
As at 31December 2010, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under interest rate related derivatives was $104m 2009 $115m, currency derivatives $123m 2009 $258m and commodity related derivatives $292m 2009 $639m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under short-term receivables and other financial assets is represented by the book values.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Market risk Financial instruments used by the Group that are affected by market risks primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivative contracts.
The principal market variables that affect the value of these financial instruments are UK and US interest rates, US Dollar to Pound Sterling exchange rates, UK and US gas prices, and Japan Custom-cleared Crude JCC and Brent oil prices.
The table below illustrates the indicative post-tax effects on the income statement and other comprehensive income of applying reasonably foreseeable market movements to the Groups financial instruments at the balance sheet date.

The effect of a corresponding decrease in these variables is approximately equal and opposite.
The following assumptions have been made: a the sensitivity includes a full years change in interest payable and receivable from floating rate borrowings and investments based on the post-swap amounts and composition as at the balance sheet date: b fair value changes from derivative instruments designated as cash flow or net investment hedges are considered fully effective and are recorded in other comprehensive income: c fair value changes from derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are considered fully effective and entirely offset by adjustments to the underlying hedged item: d fair value changes from derivatives not in a hedge relationship are recorded in the income statement: and e fair value changes from certain long-term UK gas contracts arise entirely from sensitivity to the four-year 2009 two-year forward price for UK gas.
Thelong-term gas price assumptions used in the valuation ofsuch contracts are unaffected by reasonably foreseeable movements in UK gas prices.

The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is approximately $4.4bn 2009 $5.0bn.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences either because no liability is expected to arise on distribution under applicable tax legislation or because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

E LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Criminal charges have been brought in Italy against certain former employees and consultants of BG Group in connection with allegations of improper conduct associated with the authorisation process for the planned Brindisi LNG S. p. A. Brindisi LNG regasification terminal.
BG Italia S. p. A. BG Italia, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Group, has also been charged in relation to some of these allegations under Italian Legislative Decree No.
231 2001, an Italian anti-corruption statute which imposes liability on corporate entities under certain circumstances in the event certain criminal acts are committed by management or employees of the company.
Charges have also been brought against certain former directors of Brindisi LNG, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Italia, who are alleged to have unlawfully permitted the occupation and alteration of public land, namely the port area in Brindisi where the regasification terminal is due to be constructed, as a result of improperly authorised permits.
The charges in relation to this offence against some of these former directors were extinguished via an Oblazione granted by the court.
The decision to grant the Oblazione has been challenged by the Public Prosecutor.
The trial in relation to the criminal charges commenced on 4 February 2009.
In addition, the Italian authorities may still be carrying out further investigations, the scope of which is unknown.
The Municipality of Brindisi, Province of Brindisi and Region of Puglia and three groups of environmentalists Italia Nostra, Legambiente and World Wildlife Fund WWF Italia have separately commenced civil claims seeking damages against the accused individuals and against BG Italia.
Theseclaims have been brought within the framework of the criminal case.
In October 2007, BG Group received formal notification from the Ministry of Economic Development that the original Article 8 authorisation for the construction and operation of Brindisi LNG had been suspended pending the submission by BG Group of a full Environmental Impact Assessment EIA and confirmation from the Italian authorities as to the validity of the Article 8 authorisation.
On 15 January 2008, BG Group commenced the EIA approval process by submitting an EIA.
The EIA was re-published on 7 August 2009.
On 1 July 2010, a positive EIA Decree was issued, subject to certain conditions.
Several parties have challenged the EIA approval, including Brindisi LNG which is seeking to clarify the accompanying conditions.
There are various other ongoing legal proceedings relating to the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal, for example relating to consents necessary for the construction work and environmental procedures.
The impact of these legal proceedings cannot yet be quantified but could delay or deny BG Group access to the Brindisi LNG terminal site.
BG Karachaganak Ltd, as one of the Karachaganak Contracting Companies KCC, has made claims against the Republic of Kazakhstan ROK.

The arbitration relates to certain taxes, fines and penalties paid by KPO and the KCC.
The ROK has also commenced arbitration in relation to certain unresolved items of expenditure incurred by the KCC which has led to the ROK making certain claims against the KCC.
Both arbitrations are currently suspended while the KCC and the ROK are seeking a negotiated solution.
It is not practicable at this time to estimate: the financial effects: indicate the uncertainties relating to either the amounts or timing of any economic inflows or outflows: or the possibility of any reimbursements, in relation to the legal proceedings detailed above.

com BG Group A year of delivery Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 125 27 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The majority of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme BGPS, a defined benefit registered pension plan established under trust.
The Trustee is BGGroup Pension Trustees Limited.
The BGPS is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions that, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the BGPSs assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable.
For the year ended 31December 2010, the employers contribution rate in respect of most BGPS members was effectively 35.2% of pensionable pay excluding plan expenses which were met directly by the Company.
In addition, 3% of pensionable pay was contributed by most members either directly or by their employer via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
A full independent actuarial valuation of the BGPS for funding purposes was completed as at 31March 2008.
This showed that the aggregate market value of the plan assets at 31March 2008 was 577m, representing some 83% of the accrued liabilities.
The Group made payments of 27m in 2009 and 2010 and intends to make four further payments of 27m in the years to 2014 in order to reduce the plans deficit.
Aggregate Company contributions for the year ending 31December 2011 are expected to be 69m.
The BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme BGSBS provides benefits in excess of the lifetime allowance.
This defined benefit plan is an unfunded, unregistered arrangement.
There is also an unfunded defined benefit post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare in respect of employees of Comgs.
With effect from 2 April 2007, new UK employees have been offered membership of a defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, the BGGroup Retirement Benefits Plan BGRBP.
Life assurance and income protection benefits are also provided under separate plans: these benefits are fully insured.
Members may choose the rate at which they contribute to the BGRBP, either directly or via salary sacrifice, and the additional employers contribution is determined by the rate that the member selects.
A wide range of funds is available from which members may choose how the contributions will be invested.
The cost of the BGRBP has been included in the amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group also has a number of smaller defined contribution and defined benefit plans which are not material in Group terms.
Valuations of plan assets and expected liabilities as at 31December 2010 were carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19.
In calculating the charge to the income statement including any recognised actuarial gains and losses, a 10% corridor was applied.
This means that a portion of actuarial gains and losses is recognised as income or expense only if it exceeds the greater of: a 10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at that date before deducting plan assets : and b 10% of the fair value of any plan assets at that date.
These limits are calculated and applied separately for each defined benefit plan at each balance sheet date and the portion of actuarial gains and losses to be recognised in future years for each plan is the excess of actuarial gains and losses over and above the 10% limits divided by the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in that plan.
The fair value of plan assets, the present value of plan liabilities and the net balance sheet liability were as follows: as at 31Dec 31Dec 1 Jan 2010 2009 2009 $m $m $m Fair value of plan assets 1 290 1 073 728 Present value of liabilities 1 635 1 665 1 055 Deficit in plans 345 592 327 Unrecognised net loss 85 313 71 Net balance sheet liability 260 279 256 BG Group www.

If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BGPS and BGSBS was reduced by 0.1% to 5.4%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by $33m and the service cost for 2011 would increase by $2m.
In determining the defined benefit obligation as at 31December 2010 for the BGPS and BGSBS, mortality assumptions are based on the 00 mortality series issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to each members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMI Bureaus medium cohort tables, subject to a minimum rate of improvement on the projected mortality rates of 1% per annum.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in ten years time are as follows: Life expectancy of pensioners years 31Dec 2010 31Dec 2020 Male age 60 27.6 28.7 Male age 65 22.7 23.7 Female age 60 30.2 31.1 Female age 65 25.1 26.1 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the defined benefit obligation in respect of the BGPS and BGSBS would increase by $33m and the service cost for 2011 would increase by $2m.
The defined benefit obligation for the Comgs post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare was $109m 2009 $87m.
The effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates with all other assumptions remaining constant on the aggregate service and interest costs for the Comgs plan would be an increase or decrease of $1m 2009 $1m and on the defined benefit obligation would be an increase of $13m or a decrease of $11m 2009 $10m increase or $8m decrease.
