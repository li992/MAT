23 Capital management, financial instruments and financial risk management The Group finances its operations by a combination of shareholders funds, minority interest, deposits and on account contract receipts and, where taken out, borrowings.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to maintain an appropriate capital structure in the business to allow management to focus on creating sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, with flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise in the short and medium-term.
The Group monitors capital levels principally by monitoring net debt cash levels, cash generated and return on average capital employed.
The Groups financial instruments comprise financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities being: loan stock, bank loans, trade payables, deposits and on account receipts, loans from joint ventures and accruals.
Cash and cash equivalents is the principal financial instrument used to finance the business.
The other financial instruments highlighted arise in the ordinary course of business.
As all of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling there is no direct currency risk, and, therefore the Groups main financial risks are primarily: liquidity risk the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available: market interest rate risk the risk that Group financing activities are adversely affected by fluctuation in market interest rates: and market credit risk the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Group.
