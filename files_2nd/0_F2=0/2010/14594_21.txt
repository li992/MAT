The most significant elements of the groups total consolidated goodwill of 355.1m at 31 December 2010 are allocated to PANalytical: 97.7m 2009: 99.3m, BTG: 54.7m 2009: 54.9m, HBM: 72.3m 2009: 74.7m and Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration: 68.9m 2009: 59.4m.
Acquired entities are quickly integrated into existing group companies with the result that it is not appropriate to consider their individual performance when determining cash-generating units and performing goodwill impairment testing.
Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is a specific indication of impairment.
There were no indications of impairment in 2010.
As part of the annual impairment test review, the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity, reflecting the projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit based on actual operating results, the most recent budget for the next financial year, and strategic review projections for 2012 and 2013.
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based relate to business performance over the next three years, longterm growth rates beyond 2013 and the discount rates applied.
There are no individually significant business level cash flow assumptions in respect of any business that materially impact the impairment testing.
The key judgements are the level of revenue and operating margins anticipated and the proportion of operating profit converted to cash in each year.
Growth rates for the period beyond 2013 are assumed to be 2.5% 2009: 2.5%, which is considered to be at or below long-term market trends for each business.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using entity-specific pre-tax discount rates between 12% and 17% 2009: 14% and 18%.
These rates have been determined taking size of business and specific geographic and industry risk factors into account.
No impairment charge has been required to be recognised in either 2010 or 2009.
76 Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Highlights Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements The directors do not consider that there are any reasonable possible sensitivities that could arise in the next 12 months that could result in a significant impairment charge arising.
For illustration, the directors have considered the following specific individual sensitivities: a 2% increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to each business would result in an impairment of nil 2009: nil : if the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced to 1% no impairment would arise 2009: nil : and if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 25% for the next two years no impairment would arise 2009: nil.
Management considers that operating results in 2010 confirm that none of the groups trading businesses have suffered permanent diminutions in value as a result of recent difficult economic conditions.

Trade and other receivables continued An impairment has been recorded against the trade receivables that the group believes may not be recoverable.
In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as any disputes, or other factors delaying payment, and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historic collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
All trade receivables past due for more than 120 days have been fully provided in line with the groups credit risk policy.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.

Secured bank loans Bank loans are secured by fixed charges over property at three of the groups subsidiaries.
Of these 1.5m is denominated in Chinese renminbi and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%, 0.5m is denominated in US dollars and is repayable by instalments until December 2014 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin, and 0.2m is denominated in euros and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin.
Unsecured loan notes The interest rates on the unsecured loan notes are those contracted on the underlying borrowings before taking into account any cross-currency interest rate swaps, and remain fixed until redemption.
On issue of the US$100m loan notes in October 2003, the group entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap which has the effect of converting this US dollar borrowing into fixed interest euro-denominated debt.
The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of 90.5m with a fixed interest rate of 5.64%.
This interest rate remains fixed until redemption.
80 Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Highlights Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Under adopted IFRS, where cross-currency interest rate swaps are used, the value of the underlying US dollar borrowing is presented in this borrowings note and the value of the related cross-currency interest rate swaps is presented separately within derivative financial instruments in Note 20.
For management purposes, the value attributed to the portion of the swap arrangements that converts US dollar borrowings into euro borrowings is viewed as part of the groups net debt, as analysed below.

The fair value of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net present values.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2010 is an asset of 2.3m 2009: 0.9m of which 1.9m has been credited to the hedging reserve 2009: 1.0m, and 0.4m credited to the income statement 2009: 0.1m debit.
These contracts mature over periods not exceeding 12 months.

Under adopted IFRS, the underlying US dollar borrowings are required to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the crosscurrency interest rate swaps.
In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is required to be recognised in full on the balance sheet.
The table below shows the movements in the total value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps during the year and also how it is attributed to its currency and interest portions.

However, the interest portion of the swap is ineffective in this hedging relationship.
Accordingly, the change in value of the currency portion of the swap is recognised together with the change in value of the underlying US dollar borrowings in the statement of comprehensive income, and the change in value of the interest portion of the swap is recognised in the statement of income within financing costs.
The groups US$75.6m borrowings have been designated as a net investment hedge of the groups net investment in its US businesses.
The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data and represent a Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.

Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2010 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the groups profit before tax by approximately 0.5m 2009: increase of 0.2m.
Based on foreign exchange translational exposures for the year ended 31 December 2010 it is estimated that a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the groups profit before tax by approximately 2.2m 2009: 0.6m, a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the euro Danish krone against sterling would have decreased the groups profit before tax by approximately 2.9m 2009: 1.1m and a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the Swiss franc against sterling would have decreased the groups profit before tax by approximately 2.2m 2009: 1.6m.
In addition, a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the groups net assets by approximately 26.1m and a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the groups net assets by approximately 41.2m: exposures to other currencies are not considered to have a material impact on net assets.

Provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where the effect is significant, generally only where it is anticipated that a liability will crystallise in more than one year.
Reorganisation Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business and represent the directors best estimate of the cost to complete the restructuring.
Costs are expected to be incurred within one year and there is little judgement in determining the amount.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the groups standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, with the occasional extension up to 36 months.
These extended warranties are not significant.
The provision represents the directors best estimate of the groups liability based on past experience, and barring significant unforeseen events, there is little judgement involved in determining the amount.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other comprises mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes.
The company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations although there is a higher degree of judgement involved.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against group companies unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified, but the directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully, and therefore the possibility of any material outflow in settlement in excess of amounts provided is assessed as remote.

This rate reduction has no material impact on the financial statements as at 31 December 2010.
No account will be taken of the expected further 3% reduction in UK tax rates until substantive enactment of these changes.
Until this change and other potential changes are enacted it is not possible to identify the impact these changes might have.
However, for indicative purposes only, had the UK main corporate tax rate been reduced to 24% the net impact on recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2010 would not have been material.

Other reserves Movements in reserves are set out in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The retained earnings reserve also includes own shares purchased by the company and treated as treasury shares see Note 27.
The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
86 Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Highlights Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Hedging reserve This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve records the historical repurchase of the groups own shares.
Share-based payments Under the Save As You Earn scheme, equity shares are issued following a vesting period of three years.

There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under the Save As You Earn scheme.
The Executive Share Option Scheme and Save As You Earn share option schemes were set up in order to provide executives and selected employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the company.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
Share options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are also subject to performance criteria, being the fulfilment of earnings growth targets.

The group recognised a total charge of 7.3m 2009: 0.4m credit in the statement of income, of which 6.6m related to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
Disposal of businesses During the year the group did not divest any businesses.
On 30 September 2009, the group sold its operation in Hungary for a profit on disposal of 0.1m.
The total consideration was 0.1m net of transaction costs.
Treasury shares At 31 December 2010, the group held 9,073,760 treasury shares 2009: 9,493,575.
419,815 of these shares were issued to satisfy options exercised by employees which were granted under the groups share schemes 2009: 200,920.
No shares were repurchased by the group during the year 2009: nil and no shares were cancelled during the year 2009: nil.
Acquisitions On 7 April 2010, the group acquired the trade and assets of Reologica Instruments AB, located in Sweden, for a consideration of 0.5m.
No goodwill arose on the Reologica Instruments AB acquisition, with the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired represented by technology-based intangibles.
This business has been integrated into the Materials Analysis segment.
On 6 July 2010, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Zhuhai Omec Instruments Co. Ltd, a company based in China, which extends the group's capabilities in analytical systems for particle characterisation, for a total consideration of 9.2m including 1.9m contingent on the future performance of the acquired business.
This forms part of the Materials Analysis segment.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer-related and marketing based intangibles and the value of a non-compete agreement entered into with the previous owners of the business.
On 1 October 2010, the group acquired the trade and assets of a distributor in Japan where direct presence was sought for a consideration of 4.6m including 1.7m contingent on the future performance of the acquired business.
This also forms part of the Materials Analysis segment.
No goodwill arose on this acquisition with the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired represented by customer-based intangibles.
There was no material fair value attaching to the preexisting relationships with the distributor.
Also on 1 October 2010, the group acquired the trade and assets of N-Tron Corp, a company based in the USA, which extends the group's capabilities in industrial networking products, for a consideration of 32.9m including deferred consideration of 0.1m.
This forms part of the Industrial Controls segment.
An analysis of the assets acquired is provided below.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired is represented by customer-related, technology and other intangibles of 9.1m, 2.5m and 2.1m, respectively, with residual goodwill arising of 16.7m.
The goodwill arising is considered to represent the value of the acquired workforce and the ability to exploit the groups existing distribution arrangements to expand N-Trons routes to market, particularly outside of North America where it currently makes limited sales.
On 24 November 2010, the group acquired 100% of the shares of the Delta F Corporation, a company based in the USA, which extends the group's capabilities in trace oxygen and water measurement, for a consideration of 15.8m, including deferred consideration of 0.4m.
This forms part of the In-line Instrumentation segment.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired is represented by technology-based intangibles of 9.0m with residual goodwill arising of 7.6m.
The goodwill arising is considered to represent the value of the acquired workforce and the ability to exploit the groups existing customer relationships and know-how to expand Delta Fs routes to market, particularly into markets both geographic and industry where it currently makes limited sales.
The assets and liabilities acquired as a result of the above transactions, together with the aggregate purchase consideration, are summarised below.
The revenue and operating profit contribution from the acquisitions in the year to the group's results for the year were 8.1m and 1.1m respectively.
Group revenue and operating profit would have been 929.6m and 135.4m, respectively, had each of these acquisitions taken place on the first day of the year.
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2010 89 Notes to the Accounts continued 28.
Acquisitions continued On acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010, the deferred and contingent consideration has been revised to reflect the increased earn-out payments amounting to 8.3m that were not accrued at 31 December 2009 with a corresponding increase to goodwill.
The group also paid 4.5m in respect of prior period acquisitions, which had been accrued as deferred or contingent consideration at 31 December 2009.
Acquisition-related costs of 1.9m have been recognised in the statement of income under IFRS 3 Revised and included within administrative expenses.
The effect of the acquisition on the individual assets and liabilities of the group is as follows: Book 2010 value Adjustments Fair value Net assets acquired under 2010 acquisitions m m m Intangible fixed assets 0.1 36.5 36.6 Tangible fixed assets 0.5 0.1 0.4 Inventories 4.1 0.2 3.9 Trade and other receivables 4.5 4.5 Trade and other payables 1.7 1.7 Provisions 0.1 0.1 Deferred tax liabilities 5.7 5.7 Cash 0.8 0.8 Net assets acquired 8.2 30.5 38.7 Goodwill 24.3 Total consideration in respect of 2010 acquisitions 63.0 Analysis of cash outflow in consolidated cash flow statement Total consideration in respect of 2010 acquisitions 63.0 Adjustment for cash acquired on 2010 acquisitions 0.8 Deferred and contingent consideration on 2010 acquisitions to be paid in future years 4.1 Cash paid in 2010 in respect of 2010 acquisitions 58.1 Prior year acquisitions Purchase price adjustment re prior year acquisition 8.3 Deferred and contingent consideration in relation to prior year acquisitions: Accrued at 31 December 2009 4.5 Accrued during 2010 but not paid at 31 December 2010 8.3 Cash paid in 2010 in respect of prior year acquisitions 4.5 Net cash outflow relating to acquisitions 62.6 An additional purchase price of 8.3m in relation to prior period acquisitions has been accrued but not paid during the year based on updated expectations of the amounts to be paid under contingent consideration arrangements.
Due to their contractual due dates, the fair value of receivables acquired shown above approximates the gross contractual amounts receivable.
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 Revised.
Contingent consideration exists on two of the acquisitions made in 2010.
The maximum amounts payable which will be settled in cash total 4.1m and are contingent based on the future performance of the acquired businesses over periods of up to three years.
Reflecting the levels of the performance targets set and expected business performance, these amounts have been accrued in full at the respective acquisition dates as the fair value of the contingent consideration is considered by the directors to approximate the full amounts potentially payable under the earn out arrangements.
16.7m of the goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is expected to be amortised and deductible for tax purposes.
