Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010 1.
Reporting entity HSBC Infrastructure Company Limited the Company is a company domiciled in Guernsey, Channel Islands, whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 March 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Consolidated Group.
The Consolidated Group invests in infrastructure projects in the UK and Europe.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Consolidated Group.
Of the Consolidated Groups portfolio of 33 investments, 22 have been accounted for as investments the Entity Investments in accordance with the accounting policies set out in parts b and d of note 2.
The eleven remaining investments are deemed to be subsidiaries of the Company the Operating Subsidiaries, and are therefore treated as business combinations as described in parts b and c of note 2.
Certain items of the accounting policies apply only to the Operating Subsidiaries.
Where applicable, this is noted in the relevant accounting policy note.
Key accounting policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements and the company financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 May 2010.
The consolidated financial statements which give a true and fair view have been prepared in compliance with the Companies Guernsey Law 2008 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU using the historical cost basis, except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Consolidated Groups functional currency.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU, requires the Directors and advisers to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Investment Advisers Report on pages 10 to 16.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Results on pages 17 to 20.
In addition, notes 1 to 4 and 21 to 22 of the financial statements include the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with long-term contracts with various public sector customers and suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Note 3 shows critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.
Supplementary information has been provided analysing the income statement between those items of a revenue nature and those of a capital nature, in order to better reflect the Consolidated Groups activities as an investment company.
Those items of income and expenditure which relate to the interest and dividend yield of investments and annual operating and interest expenditure are shown as revenue.
Those items of income and expenditure which arise from changes in the fair value of investments, foreign exchange movements, finance receivables and derivative financial instruments are recognised as capital.
Standards adopted early by the Consolidated Group During the year and the prior year no new standards were adopted early by the Consolidated Group.
Key accounting policies continued New standards effective for the current year The following standards which have been applied in this years financial statements are: IFRS 8 Operating Segments the Directors and the Investment Adviser are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment in infrastructure which is currently predominantly in private finance initiative and public private partnership companies.
The financial information used by the Directors and the Investment Adviser to allocate resources and manage the group presents the business as a single segment.
IAS 1 revised 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements the Directors are of the opinion there are no other items of comprehensive income or expense apart from those disclosed in the consolidated income statement.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments which requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair value measurement hierarchy.
Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate.
This amendment removes the definition of the cost method and requires the presentation of all dividends including those paid from pre-acquisition profits as income in the separate financial statements of the investor.
IAS 23 revised 2007 Borrowing Costs the amendments remove the option of expensing borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets.
Although the amendments are intended to clarify definitions of qualifying assets and eligible borrowing costs especially in the case of land under development the amendments are not intended to change the definitions fundamentally.
Improvements to IFRSs May 2008 the Improvements to IFRSs 2008, which are endorsed for use in the EU, is the result of the IASBs first annual improvements project AIP.
The Improvements to IFRSs 2008 contains 35 amendments and is divided into two parts: Part I includes 24 amendments that result in accounting changes for presentation, recognition or measurement purposes Part I amendments.
The effective dates and transitional requirements are set out on a standard by standard basis.
Part II includes 11 terminology or editorial amendments that the IASB expects to have either no or only minimal effects on accounting Part II amendments.
The amendments in Part II shall be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Amendment to IFRS2 Share-Based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations.
This clarifies the definition of vesting conditions and introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions and the relevant accounting treatment.
Amendments to IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
This amendment clarifies that a reassessment of embedded derivatives is required whenever a financial asset has been reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category.
The adoption of these standards has not led to any changes in the Consolidated Groups accounting policies.
Standards not yet applied As at 31 March 2010 the following standards applicable to the Consolidated Group, which have not been applied in this financial information, were in issue and endorsed by the EU but not yet effective: IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation which is mandatory for EU adopters for annual periods commencing on or after 30 June 2009.
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for hedges of net investments in foreign operations in an entitys consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations which is applicable for annual periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, however, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, some contingent payments are subsequently re-measured at fair value through income, goodwill may be calculated based on the parents share of net assets or it may include goodwill related to the minority interest, and all transaction costs are expensed.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements which is applicable for annual periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
Requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control: any remaining interest in an investee is re-measured to fair value in determining the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss where control over the investee is lost.
HICL ANNUAL REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2010 51 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2010 2.
Key accounting policies continued Standards not yet applied continued IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners which is applicable for annual periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
Provides accounting guidance for non-reciprocal distributions of non-cash assets to owners and those in which owners may elect to receive a cash alternative.

Clarifies the requirements for IFRSs for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the above standards in future years will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Consolidated Group.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Consolidated Group include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries up to 31 March 2010.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities as defined in IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line by line basis from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
Nine of the eleven subsidiaries have a different statutory financial reporting date to the Company, being 31 December.
Their results for the year to 31 March are included by reference to management accounts.
Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence as defined in IAS 28 Investments in Associates.
By virtue of the Companys status as an investment fund and the exemption provided by IAS 28.1, investments in such entities are designated upon initial recognition to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Joint ventures are those entities over which the Company has joint control as defined by IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
By virtue of the Companys status as an investment fund and the exemption provided by IAS 31.1, investments in such entities are designated upon initial recognition to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Intra-Group receivables, liabilities, revenue and expenses are eliminated in their entirety when preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Gains that arise from intra-group transactions and that are unrealised from the standpoint of the Consolidated Group on the balance sheet date are eliminated in their entirety.
Unrealised losses on intra-group transactions are also eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, to the extent that the loss does not correspond to an impairment loss.
c Acquisition of subsidiaries All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition over the Consolidated Groups share of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed including intangible assets of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be measured reliably, sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Costs comprise the fair values of assets given and liabilities assumed, plus any direct costs of acquisition.
d Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Key accounting policies continued i Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, finance receivables, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs, except for financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
Investments in equity and debt securities Entity Investments investments in the equity and loanstock of entities engaged in infrastructure activities which are not classified as subsidiaries of the Consolidated Group are designated at fair value through profit or loss since the Consolidated Group manages these investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value.
The initial difference between the transaction price and the fair value, derived from using the discounted cash flows methodology at the date of acquisition, is recognised only when observable market data indicates there is a change in a factor that market participants would consider in setting the price of that investment.
After initial recognition, investments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement.
Finance receivables Finance receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, finance receivables are measured at fair value using the discounted cash flows methodology, with changes recognised in the income statement as gains loss on finance receivables as a capital item.
Finance receivables are designated at fair value through profit or loss because it eliminates or significantly reduces the accounting mismatch that would result from fair value movements in interest rate swaps.
Loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration received, less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Other Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
ii Derivative financial instruments The Operating Subsidiaries hold derivative financial instruments to mitigate their interest rate risk and inflation rate risk exposures.
All derivatives are recognised initially at fair value with attributable transaction costs recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Thereafter, derivatives are measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement as part of finance costs.
Fair value is based on price quotations from financial institutions active in the relevant market.
The Consolidated Group has not used hedge accounting.
iii Fair values The fair values are determined using the income approach, except for derivative financial instruments, which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to each asset at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, regard is had to risk free rates, the specific risks of each investment and the evidence of recent transactions.
iv Effective interest The effective interest rate is that rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant assets carrying amount.
e Intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised as part of a business combination if they are reliably measurable and separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual legal rights.
Only one category of intangible asset has been recognised as part of a business combination to date, being the fair value of service concessions in Operating Subsidiaries as at the date of acquisition.
These assets are being amortised over the life of the concessions concerned on a straight-line basis.
The accounting policies for intangible assets arising under IFRIC 12 are disclosed in part k of this note.
HICL ANNUAL REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2010 53 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2010 2.
Key accounting policies continued f Impairment i Financial assets Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis.
The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
ii Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Consolidated Groups non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any evidence of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value in use.
The value in use is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would, have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
g Share capital and share premium Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written-off against the balance of the share premium account.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
i Minority interests The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the carrying value of the minority interest are allocated against the interest of the parent, except to the extent that the minority has both a binding obligation and the ability to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
j Revenue i Services revenue Services revenue in accordance with IFRIC 12, which relates solely to the Operating Subsidiaries, is comprised of the following components: revenues from the provision of facilities management services to Private Finance Initiative PFI projects calculated as the fair value of services provided see note k i : the fair value of the consideration receivable on construction and upgrade services: availability fees and usage fees on PFI projects where the principal asset is accounted for as an intangible asset see note k ii : and third party revenues on PFI projects.
Key accounting policies continued ii Gains on finance receivables Gains on finance receivables relate solely to the Operating Subsidiaries.
Revenue Gains on finance receivables included in the revenue category includes interest, dividends and other operating income relating to finance receivables designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Interest income arising on finance receivables at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or origination date.
Dividends are recognised when the Consolidated Groups rights to receive payment have been established.
That part of the dividend which has already been recognised in the fair value of finance receivable is deducted from the carrying amount of the relevant finance receivable.
Fees and other operating income are recognised when the Consolidated Groups rights to receive payment have been established.
Capital Gains on finance receivables included in the capital category arise from the movement in the fair value of the finance receivables excluding the movements shown as revenue above.
iii Gains on investments Gains on investments relates solely to the Entity Investments.
Revenue Gains on investments included in the revenue category includes interest, dividends and other operating income relating to the Entity Investments.
Interest income arising on Entity Investments is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or origination date.
That part of the dividend which has already been recognised in the fair value of investments is deducted from the carrying amount of the relevant investment.
Capital Gains on investments included in the capital category arise from the movement in the fair value of the Entity Investments excluding the movements shown as revenue above.
k Service concessions In accordance with IFRIC 12 and the various provisions of IFRS, the Consolidated Group has determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar contracts within the Operating Subsidiaries.
Results of all service concessions which fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 conform to the following policies depending on the rights to consideration under the service concessions: i Service concessions treated as financial assets Service concessions are determined to give rise to finance receivables where the Consolidated Group, as operator, has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor.
Revenue is recognised by allocating a proportion of total cash receivable to construction income and service income.
The consideration received will be allocated by reference to the relative fair value of the services delivered, when the amounts are separately identifiable.
During the construction phase, revenue is recognised at cost, plus attributable profit to the extent that this is reasonably certain, in accordance with IAS 11.
Costs for this purpose include valuation of all work done by subcontractors whether certified or not, and all overheads other than those relating to the general administration of the relevant companies.
During the operational stage, cash received in respect of the service concessions is allocated to services revenue see part j i of this note based on its fair value, with the remainder being allocated between capital repayment and interest income using the effective interest method see part j ii of this note.
The finance receivables are designated as at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with part d of this note.
The fair values of the finance receivables are determined in a similar manner to that described in part d i, with changes recognised in the income statement.
HICL ANNUAL REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2010 55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2010 2.
Key accounting policies continued ii Service concessions treated as intangible assets Service concessions are determined to give rise to intangible assets to the extent the Consolidated Group, as operator, has a contractual right to charge users of the public services.
The intangible asset represents the construction cost of assets which give rise to the contractual right to charge.
The intangible asset is amortised to estimated residual value over the remaining life of the service concession and tested each year for impairment.
Revenue arising in respect of these service concessions is recognised when the services are delivered.
l Borrowing costs Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use.
Other borrowing costs are expensed.
m Income tax Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company itself is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend and interest income received by the Consolidated Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income, but all such tax is currently recoverable.
Income tax on the profit for the year of the Operating Subsidiaries comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
n Foreign exchange gains and losses Transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as capital amounts.
o Segmental reporting The Chief Operating Decision Maker the CODM is of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment in infrastructure which is currently predominately in private finance initiatives and public private partnership companies in one geographical area, the United Kingdom.
The financial information used by the CODM to allocate resources and manage the group presents the business as a single segment is prepared on an Investment basis.
The Investment basis deconsolidates the subsidiary investments.
A reconciliation of the consolidated financial statements to pro-forma statements on an Investment basis is shown within the Financial Results of the annual report.
p Expenses All expenses and the profit share of the General Partner are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The Consolidated Groups investment management and administration fees, finance costs including interest on long-term borrowings and all other expenses are charged through the consolidated income statement.
q Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends, this is when declared by the directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
Key accounting policies continued r Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Consolidated Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Consolidated Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
s Statement of compliance Pursuant to the Protection of Investors Bailiwick of Guernsey Law, 1987 the Company is an Authorised Closed-Ended Investment Scheme.
As an authorised scheme, the Company is subject to certain ongoing obligations to the Guernsey Financial Services Commission.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
i Investments at fair value through profit or loss The Consolidated Group has a greater than 50% shareholding in certain entities see Note 15, where in the opinion of the Directors it is unable to govern the financial and operating policies of the entities by virtue of agreements with the other shareholder s. These entities are consequently not treated as subsidiaries, and instead they are accounted for as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, as set out in Note 2 b.
By virtue of the Companys status as an investment fund and the exemption provided by IAS 28.1 and IAS 31.1, investments in associates and joint ventures are designated upon initial recognition to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Fair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows at the appropriate rate.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to risk free rates, specific risks and the evidence of recent transactions.
The Directors have satisfied themselves that the PFI PPP investments share the same investment characteristics and as such constitute a single asset class for IFRS 7 disclosure purposes.
The carrying amount of the PFI PPP investments would be an estimated 7.5m higher or 7.2m lower 2009: 7.0m higher or 6.7m lower if the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis were to differ by 25 basis points from that used in the fair value calculation.
The weighted average discount rate for the PFI PPP portfolio as at 31 March 2010 was 8.7% 2009: 8.1%.
The carrying amount of the PFI PPP investments would be an estimated 6.0m higher or 5.3m lower 2009: 5.4m higher or 5.7m lower if the inflation rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis were to differ by 25 basis points from that used in the fair value calculation.
The inflation rate assumed for all future periods from 31 March 2010 was 2.75% 2009: 0% to March 2011 and 2.75% thereafter.
The carrying amount of the PFI PPP investments would be an estimated 1.9m higher or 2.0m lower 2009: 1.7m higher or 1.6m lower if the deposit rates used in the discounted cash flow analysis were to differ by 25 basis points from that used in the fair value calculation.
The deposit rates assumed for all future periods from 31 March 2010 were 1% to March 2012 and 4.5% thereafter 2009: 1% to March 2011 and 4.5% thereafter.
ii Finance receivables at fair value through profit or loss Fair values are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows at the appropriate rate.
The carrying amount of finance receivables would be an estimated 14.4m higher or 13.8m lower 2009: 15.9m higher or 15.3m lower if the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis were to differ by 25 basis points from that used in the fair value calculation.
The discount rates at 31 March 2010 were between 5.4% and 6.8% 2009: between 5.0% and 6.4%.
HICL ANNUAL REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2010 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2010 3.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued iii IFRIC 12 Service concessions fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 where the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and the price: and the grantor controls, through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise, any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the service agreement.
Each subsidiary has been assessed to determine whether they fall within the scope of IFRIC 12.
Following this review it was determined that all eleven subsidiaries controlled at the year end, fall within this scope.
Service concessions are determined to be finance receivables where the operator has a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor.
Alternatively, service concessions are determined to be intangible assets to the extent the operator has a contractual right to charge users of the public services.
iv Intangible assets Intangible assets represent fair value of customer contracts for operating subsidiary projects recognised on acquisition, which are primarily attributable to the service portion of the project contracts, and intangible assets recognised under IFRIC 12.
Fair values are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to the services portion of the service concessions acquired at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, regard is had to risk free rates and the specific risks of each project.
Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk is managed by the Group on an investment basis, so for the purposes of this note, the Group comprises the Company, its two wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiaries HICL Infrastructure 1 SARL and HICL Infrastructure 2 SARL and the English Limited Partnership Infrastructure Investments Limited Partnership IILP, and is referred to as the Investment Group.
The objective of the Investment Groups financial risk management is to manage and control the risk exposures of its investment portfolio.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks, however the review and management of financial risks are delegated to the Investment Adviser and the Operator of the Group which has documented procedures designed to identify, monitor and manage the financial risks to which the Investment Group is exposed.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to financial risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing risk and the Groups management of its financial resources.
The Investment Group owns a portfolio of investments predominantly in the subordinated loanstock and ordinary equity of project finance companies.
These companies are structured at the outset to minimise financial risks where possible, and the Investment Adviser and Operator primarily focus their risk management on the direct financial risks of acquiring and holding the portfolio, but continue to monitor the indirect financial risks of the underlying projects through representation, where appropriate, on the Boards of the project companies and the receipt of regular financial and operational performance reports.
Interest rate risk The Investment Group invests in subordinated loanstock of project companies, usually with fixed interest rate coupons.
Where floating rate debt is owned the primary risk is that the Consolidated Groups cash flows will be subject to variation depending upon changes to base interest rates.
The portfolios cash flows are continually monitored and reforecasted both over the near future five year time horizon and the long-term over whole period of projects concessions to analyse the cash flow returns from investments.
The Investment Group has made limited use of borrowings to finance the acquisition of investments and the forecasts are used to monitor the impact of changes in borrowing rates against cash flow returns from investments as increases in borrowing rates will reduce net interest margins.
The Groups policy is to ensure that interest rates are sufficiently hedged to protect the groups net interest margins from significant fluctuations when entering into material medium long term borrowings.
This includes engaging in interest rate swaps or other interest rate derivative contracts.
The Investment Group has an indirect exposure to changes in interest rates through its investment in project companies, which are financed by senior debt.
Senior debt financing of project companies is generally either through floating rate debt, fixed rate bonds or index linked bonds.
Where senior debt is floating rate, the projects typically have concession length hedging arrangements in place, which are monitored by the project companies managers, finance parties and boards of directors.
Floating rate debt is hedged using fixed floating interest rate swaps.
The finance costs in the income statement would be an estimated 9.7m higher or 9.7m lower 2009: 8.4m higher or 8.4m lower if the interest rates used in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swaps were to differ by 25 basis points.
Financial instruments continued Inflation risk The Groups project companies are generally structured so that contractual income and costs are either wholly or partially linked to specific inflation where possible to minimise the risks of mismatch between income and costs due to movements in inflation indexes.
The Investment Groups overall cashflows are estimated to partially vary with inflation and consequently the portfolio valuation will vary with inflation.
The effects of these inflation changes do not always immediately flow through to the Investment Groups cashflows, particularly where a projects loanstock debt carries a fixed coupon and the inflation change flows through by way of dividends.
The sensitivity of the portfolio valuation is shown in Note 3 i.
The finance costs in the income statement would be an estimated 5.0m higher or 5.0m lower 2009: 2.4m higher or 2.4m lower if the RPI rates used in the fair value calculation of the inflation swaps were to differ by 25 basis points.
Market risk Returns from the Investment Groups investments are affected by the price at which they are acquired.
The value of these investments will be a function of the discounted value of their expected future cash flows, and as such will vary with, inter alia, movements in interest rates, market prices and the competition for such assets.
Currency risk The projects in which the Group invests all conduct their business and pay interest, dividends and principal in sterling other than its investment in Dutch High Speed Rail project, which conducts its business and pays its interest, dividends and principal in Euros.
The group monitors its foreign exchange exposures using its near term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
Its policy is to use foreign exchange hedging to provide protection to the level of sterling distributions that the Investment Group aims to pay over the medium term, where considered appropriate.
This may involve the use of forward exchange and other currency hedging contracts, as well as the use of Euro and other currency denominated borrowings.
The Investment Group hedged its Euro exposure on its investment in Dutch High Speed Rail project through 3.1m of Euro borrowings which are included within loans and borrowings see Note 21, and through the forward sale of Euros.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Group will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
The Groups key direct counterparties are the project companies in which it makes investments.
The Investment Groups near term cash flow forecasts are used to monitor the timing of cash receipts from project counterparties.
Underlying the cash flow forecast are project company cash flow models, which are regularly updated by project companies and provided to the Operator, for the purposes of demonstrating the projects ability to pay interest and dividends based on a set of detailed assumptions.
Many of the Investment Groups investment and subsidiary entities generally receive revenue from government departments, and public sector or local authority clients.
Therefore a significant portion of the Groups investments revenue is with counterparties of good financial standing.
The Group is also reliant on the projects subcontractors continuing to perform their service delivery obligations such that revenues to projects are not disrupted.
The Investment Adviser has a subcontractor counterparty monitoring procedure in place.
The credit standing of subcontractors is reviewed, and the risk of default estimated for each significant counterparty position.
Monitoring is ongoing, and period end positions are reported to the Board on a quarterly basis.
The Investment Groups largest credit risk exposure to a project at 31 March was to the Home Office project 16.2% of portfolio by value and the largest subcontractor counterparty risk exposure was to subsidiaries of the Bouygues group which provided facilities management services in respect of 27% of the portfolio by value.
The Consolidated Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, cash and deposits.
The Consolidated Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of well known banks.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
Fair value adjustments, or loan impairments, are made when the net present value of the future cash flows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases a loan impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
As at 31 March 2010, the ageing of trade receivables past due but not impaired were as follows: 31 March 31 March 2010 2009 million million 3 to 6 months due 0.2 0.1 Over 6 months due 0.1 0.3 0.1 At 31 March 2010 there were no loans and other receivables considered past due or impaired 2009: nil for the Consolidated Group.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk continued The Consolidated Groups maximum exposure to credit risk over financial assets is the carrying value of those assets in the balance sheet.
The Consolidated Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as these fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to meets its liabilities when due.
The Group ensures it maintains adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Investment Groups investments are predominantly funded by share capital and medium term debt funding.
The Investment Groups investments are generally in private companies in which there is no listed market and therefore such investment would take time to realise and there is no assurance that the valuations placed on the investments would be achieved from any such sale process.
One of the Investment Groups investments is a loan to Kemble Water, the acquisition vehicle for Thames Water.
There is an informal unlisted market for this investment providing a level of liquidity above that of the Investment Groups other investments.
The Investment Groups investments have borrowings which rank senior to the Investment Groups own investments into the companies.
This senior debt is structured such that, under normal operating conditions, it will be repaid within the expected life of the projects.
Debt raised by the investment companies from third parties is without recourse to the Investment Group.
The Investment Groups investments may include obligations to meet future subscription amounts.
These obligations will typically be supported by standby letters of credit, issued by the Investment Groups bankers in favour of the senior lenders to the investment companies.
Such subscription obligations are met from the Investment Groups cash resources when they fall due.
Such obligations totalled 8.3m 2009: nil at the year end.
The Investment Group currently has a committed 200m five year revolving bank facility expiring in December 2012 and is secured over all assets of the Consolidated Group.
The facility is of a sufficient size to meet the Investment Groups foreseeable funding requirements, and to provide significant headroom available to support acquisitions, should suitable opportunities be identified and executed.
The table below analyses the Consolidated Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

Financial instruments continued Capital management The Board utilises its 200m revolving acquisition facility to fund acquisitions.
Further equity raisings are considered when debt drawings are at an appropriate level.
The proceeds from the share issues are used to repay debt or to fund future investment commitments.
The Investment Group makes prudent use of its leverage.

per annum of its issued Ordinary Shares: and make tender offers for the Ordinary Shares.
There were no changes in the Investment Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Fair value estimation The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Non-derivative financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Consolidated Group uses the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to each asset at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to risk free rates, the specific risks of each investment and the evidence of recent transactions.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Consolidated Group is the current bid price.
Note 2 discloses the methods used in determining fair values on a specific asset liability basis.
Where applicable, further information about the assumptions used in determining fair value is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

See note 21 for the comparison between fair values and the carrying values of the fixed rate and RPI-linked bonds.
Secured bank and bond borrowings totalling 642.3m 2009: 606.7m are secured by fixed and or floating charges over the Consolidated Groups financial assets.
The terms of these charges are generally of a form that are usual and customary to project finance borrowing and lending activities.
Fair value hierarchy The fair value hierarchy is defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

The Kemble Water junior loan, which is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, had a gain in valuation of 6.4m during the year 2009: 7.7m loss.
The remaining investments were all classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
The Investment Adviser has carried out fair market valuations of the investments as at 31 March 2010.
The Directors have satisfied themselves as to the methodology used, the discount rates applied, and the valuation.
The Directors have also obtained an independent opinion from a third party, with considerable expertise in valuing these type of investments, supporting the reasonableness of the valuation.
The Kemble Water junior loan was valued on a market quote basis and the other investments, which are all investments in PFI PPP projects, are valued using a discounted cashflow methodology.
The valuation techniques and methodologies have been applied consistently with the prior year.
Discount rates applied range from 8.4% to 11.0% weighed average of 8.7% 2009: 7.8% to 8.6% weighted average of 8.1%.
The following economic assumptions were used in the discounted cashflow valuations: UK inflation rates 2.75% UK deposit interest rates 1% for 2 years to March 2012 and 4.5% thereafter Euro Sterling exchange rate 0.89 for all future periods The economic assumptions for the year ended 31 March 2009 were as follows: UK inflation rates Zero for 2 years to March 2011 and 2.75% thereafter UK deposit interest rates 1% for 2 years to March 2011 and 4.5% thereafter Euro Sterling exchange rate 0.93 for all future periods Investments are generally restricted on their ability to transfer funds to the Group under the terms of their senior funding arrangement for that investment.
Significant restrictions include: Historic and projected debt service and loan life cover ratios exceed a given threshold: Required cash reserve account levels are met: Senior lenders have agreed the current financial model that forecasts the economic performance of the project company: Project company is in compliance with the terms of its senior funding arrangements: and Senior lenders have approved the annual budget for the company.

The Consolidated Groups economic interest in the Helicopter Training project includes the above investment in CAE Aircrew Training Services Plc Op Co and the controlling interest in CVS Leasing Limited Asset Co see note 28.
The Consolidated Group has future loanstock commitments of 8.3m and its share of the projects capital commitments is 23.8m.
There are no other future loanstock or capital commitments on other investments at fair value through the profit or loss.
Acquisition of subsidiaries During the year the Group acquired additional interests in the equity and loan stock of Durham and Cleveland Firearms Training Centre, GMPA Police Stations and MPA Specialist Training Centre.
These acquisitions take the Groups economic interest in these four projects to 72.9% in each.
The total consideration paid in cash for the interests in these projects was 8.0m.
The transaction cost for the three acquisitions was fide minimus.
Prior to the acquisition of the additional equity these PFI projects were held as investments at fair value and therefore there has been no gain or loss as a result of re-measuring to fair value the interests held prior to the acquisitions.
Fair values were determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to each asset at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
Intangible assets represent the fair value of customer contracts for operating subsidiary projects recognised on acquisition, which are primarily attributable to the service portion of the project contracts, and intangible assets recognised under IFRIC 12.
Intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the concessions concerned.
