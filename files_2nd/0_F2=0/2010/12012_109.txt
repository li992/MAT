These savings can then be used to buy ordinary shares at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period at the third, fifth or seventh year anniversary of the option being granted.
Options expire six months following the exercise date and, except for certain specific circumstances such as redundancy, lapse if the employee leaves the Group before the option exercise period commences.
