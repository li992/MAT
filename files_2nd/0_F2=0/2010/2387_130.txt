Impairment In assessing whether a write-down is required in the carrying value of a potentially impaired intangible asset, item of property, plant and equipment or an equity-accounted investment, the assets carrying value is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Unless indicated otherwise, the recoverable amount used in assessing the impairment charges described below is value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset and are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
This discount rate is derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted where applicable to take into account any specific risks relating to the country where the cash-generating unit is located, although other rates may be used if appropriate to the specific circumstances.
The rate applied in each country is re-assessed each year.
In certain circumstances an impairment assessment may be carried out using fair value less costs to sell as the recoverable amount when, for example, a recent market transaction for a similar asset has taken place.
For impairments of available-for-sale financial assets that are quoted investments, the fair value is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business at the balance sheet date.
Any cumulative loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.
