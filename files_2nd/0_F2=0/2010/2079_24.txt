NGL production is now shown separately.
The change resulted in 2,545 thousand barrels, 1,129 thousand barrels and 809 thousand barrels additional NGL production and 5.41 billion cubic feet, 2.05 billion cubic feet and 1.48 billion cubic feet lower natural gas production in the years ended 30 June 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Prior amounts have been restated to ensure consistency.
2 LPG and Ethane are reported as Natural Gas Liquids NGL.
3 Total boe conversion is based on the following: 6,000 scf of natural gas equals 1 boe.
4 Average production costs include direct and indirect costs relating to the production of hydrocarbons and the foreign exchange effect of translating local currency denominated costs into US dollars but excludes ad valorem and severance taxes.
