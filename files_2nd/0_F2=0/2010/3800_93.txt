This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
For the UK, to which goodwill of 1,787 million is allocated, an increase in the discount rate of 0.4% or a decrease in the long-term growth rate of 0.6% would eliminate the headroom of approximately 100 million under each scenario.
There are no other CGUs that are sensitive to possible changes in key assumptions.
