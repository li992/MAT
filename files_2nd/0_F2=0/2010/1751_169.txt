Retirement benefits and liabilities The Group has established a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal funds are those in the UK.
Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Defined contribution schemes 17.8 13.9 Defined benefit schemes Balance sheet assets and liabilities recognised are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Retirement benefits funds in surplus 90.9 Retirement benefits funds in deficit 324.0 40.2 324.0 50.7 The Group operates four principal defined benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom: the Devonport Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme, the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme, the Rosyth Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme and the First Engineering Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pensions Scheme.
All four schemes are funded by payments to separate trustee-administered funds and the level of the Groups contributions to the schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, qualified actuaries.
The details of the latest formal actuarial valuations of these four schemes are as follows: Devonport Royal Babcock Dockyard International Rosyth Royal First Engineering Scheme Group Scheme Dockland Scheme Scheme Date of last formal actuarial valuation 31 03 08 01 04 07 31 03 06 31 12 07 Number of active members at 31 March 2009 3,426 938 1,014 506 Actuarial valuation method Projected unit Projected unit Projected unit Projected unit Results of formal actuarial valuation: Value of assets 850.0m 468.9m 448.3m 185.2m Level of funding 95% 103% 98% 102% Principal valuation assumptions: Excess of investment returns over earnings increases 2.0% 1.65%2.4% 1.75% 2.0% Excess of investment returns over pension increases 3.0% 1.6%3.25% 2.75% 2.5% As a result of the level of surplus the Groups required contribution to the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme is currently suspended in respect of the majority of active members until at least the results of the next formal valuation are available.
The Group does however make voluntary payments to the Scheme.
The employers future service contribution rate for the vast majority of members in the Devonport Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme is 20.5% of pensionable pay with additional payments of 5 million per annum to meet the funding deficit plus 4.8 million per annum to fund the deficit relating to the longevity swap entered into during the year.
The contribution rate for the Rosyth Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme is 16.4% and the First Engineering Scheme is 17.1%.
Where salary sacrifice arrangements are in place the employer effectively meets the employees contributions, in addition.
The employer cash contributions forecast for next year are: the Devonport Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme 16.9 million, the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme 6.4 million, the Rosyth Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme 5.8 million and the First Engineering Scheme 2.4 million.
15 million has already been paid into the Devonport Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme in 2009 10 in respect of next years contributions.

The Company made a contribution of 0.2 million during the year to 31 March 2010.
