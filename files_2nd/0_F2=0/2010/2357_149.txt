Financial risk management The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future development.
In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide for returns for shareholders as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a trading business.
The Groups capital comprises its shareholders equity, added together with its net borrowings stated before issue costs.
A five year record of its capital employed is displayed on page 82 together with a return on capital employed, which indicates that the Group has historically delivered both absolute growth in capital and a return on capital employed of over 20%, although not in the recent past following the market decline.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Groups decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders equity and debt financing, the Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing or cash in hand.
This is because the Group recognises that housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks.
The Group would seek to manage its capital base through control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its capital structure.
Following the sharp market movements in 2008, the Group saw a fall in its capital employed, as inventory provisions have reduced the asset base of the Group, leading to a reduction in retained earnings and thus shareholders equity.
This was partially reversed in 2009 following a successful equity placing.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank and other loans and overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also utilises financial assets and liabilities such as trade payables or receivables that arise directly from operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk.
The valuation of the Groups available for sale financial assets and a financial liability are also impacted by housing market price fluctuations, giving rise to market price risk.
Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Hedging The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings where appropriate through procuring interest rate swaps, denominated in sterling.
The decision whether to enter into a swap, and the timing of procurement of swaps depends on a number of key variables, on which management form judgements.
These matters include managements view of likely cash flows and indebtedness, interest rate movements and other macro-economic factors looking ahead.
These assumptions are reviewed with the Group Finance Director on a periodic basis prior to any decision being made.
Decisions made by management in this area are discussed with the Board to ensure transparency of decision making.
At 31 December 2010, the Group held 50 million of interest rate cap and floor collar swaps which are deemed ineffective.
All costs are being taken directly through income.
At present this cost is estimated at 0.1 million until expiry in March 2011, which reflects the fair value of the interest rate swap.
The fair value measurement of the Groups derivative financial instruments include inputs which are based on observable market data.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 77 Notes to the financial statements continued Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 18.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Groups earnings, given that Group borrowings are variable in terms of interest rate.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would increase the Groups profit before tax by approximately 779,000 2009: increase profit by 200,000. b.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There are certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales.
The largest single amount outstanding at the year end was 10.0 million 2009: 3.8 million.
The 2010 amount is secured against consented land.
The Group retains these outstanding balances as trade and other receivables.
The Group also carries credit risk with regard to available for sale financial assets which it classifies as other receivables.
Whilst material in total, the individual risk is low given the high number of counterparties.
Average exposure per transaction is 24,000 2009: 26,000, and a second charge is retained to protect the Groups interests.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables equates to the Groups exposure to credit risk.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction.
This assessment is based upon management knowledge and experience.
In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
c. Liquidity risk The Groups banking arrangements outlined in note 18 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk.
The Groups approach to assessment of liquidity risk is outlined in the section on the report on corporate governance relating to Going Concern which can be found on page 38. d. Housing market price risk The performance of the UK housing market affects the valuation of certain of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress.
