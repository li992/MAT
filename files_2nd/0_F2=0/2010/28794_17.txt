In a number of cases the Group owns more than 50% of a particular class of shares issued by an investee company or partnership interests totalling more than 50%.
The Group does not hold more than 50% of the voting rights of any of its investee companies or partnerships.
As such, holding more than 50% of a particular class of shares does not give the Group control of any the investee companies or partnerships within the meaning of IAS 27.
The Group has chosen to account for associated companies which they hold for investment purposes as fair value through the profit and loss.

During the year the Company made an investment into Augmentum 1 LP.
The Company holds 99% of aggregate contributions.
The fund is managed by J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited.

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED Provisions in respect of investments include 1.7 million 31 March 2009: nil which are expected to settle within the next twelve months.
It is anticipated that all of the other provisions noted above will be settled more than twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Indemnity Provision In 1991 the Company acquired an investment in Newmont Mining and at the same time effected a disposal of its indirect interest in Cavenham Forest Industries Inc CFI.
As part of these arrangements the Company indemnified the purchaser of CFI against certain ongoing costs being incurred by that company.
The relevant indemnified costs are expected to be incurred between 2010 and 2027 and the indemnity provision has been based on the Companys share of the projected costs.
Investment Provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.
The provision has been calculated by reference to the carrying value of the underlying investments.
In respect of segregated accounts where performance criteria have been exceeded at the end of the year, the value of the associated performance fee payable to the manager has been provided for under current liabilities.
Property The Group has a short leasehold interest in a property which is being sub-let to a third party.
The net income receivable is less than the annual outgoings and, based on a professional valuation, the Group has recognised a provision of 0.2 million as at 31 March 2010 31 March 2009: 0.2 million.
Long-term Incentive Plan This provision represents amounts accrued under a long-term incentive arrangement structured in the form of a phantom option scheme: the Share Appreciation Rights SAR plan.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, certain Directors and employees are entitled to a bonus calculated by reference to a notional number of shares in the Company.
The bonus amount payable would be equal to the increase, since the date of grant of the relevant SARs, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares, provided the relevant performance conditions are met: the provision also includes the corresponding employers national insurance liability.
The SARs can be exercised between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
The provision can be analysed by reference to the date of grant of the relevant SARs as set out below: 31 March 31 March 2010 2009 million million Date of grant 26 March 2003 1.3 25 March 2004 0.1 30 March 2005 0.1 19 July 2005 0.1 15 March 2006 0.0 1 January 2007 0.0 15 March 2007 0.5 13 March 2009 2.0 0.3 24 June 2009 0.4 19 October 2009 0.1 26 March 2010 0.1 Intrinsic value of all SARs 3.3 1.7 IFRS 2 adjustment to provision 1.0 0.6 Carrying amount of SAR provision 2.3 2.3 Intrinsic value of SARs vested as at 31 March 0.7 1.5 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 72 The Company has used a trinomial option valuation model to estimate the fair value of the SARs.
The inputs to the model included the following: expected volatility of 21% 31 March 2009: 22%, dividends of 4.0p 31 March 2009: 4.0p per share per annum, contractual life of ten years, and a risk-free interest rate based on the Sterling Benchmark Swap Curve.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on relevant historic data in respect of RITs share price.
The vesting requirements are set out in detail in the section headed Long-term Incentive Plan in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 40.
To allow for the effects of early exercise and staff turnover, it was assumed that the majority of the SARs, in terms of value, would be exercised four and a half years after the relevant grant dates.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As an investment trust, financial instruments make up the vast majority of the Groups financial position and generate its performance.
The Group holds investments in a variety of financial instruments in order to meet its investment objective to deliver long-term capital growth while preserving shareholders capital.
Asset allocation is determined by the executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
The assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares, partnership interests and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives.
The investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss FVPL : cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: long-term borrowings used to enhance returns: and derivative transactions undertaken by the Group in accordance with the Groups investment objectives, and to manage market risks and currency risks.

In relation to debtors, creditors and short-term borrowings the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The fair value of the term loans was estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
As at 31 March 2010 this amounted to 288 million 31 March 2009: 383 million.
No financial assets or liabilities were reclassified during 2010 or 2009 by the Group or the Company.
26.2 Financial Risk Management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive management under the authority of the Board and the Audit Committee, and is described in more detail below.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The objectives, policies and processes for managing risks have not changed since the previous accounting period.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole and it is at the Group level that the majority of the risk management procedures are performed.
Where relevant and materially different to the Group position, Company specific risk exposures are explained alongside those of the Group.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three types of risk: Price Risk b. below The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk Interest Rate Risk c. below The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates Currency Risk d. below The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates Management of market risk Management of market risk is fundamental to the Groups investment objective and the investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward.
Exposure to any one entity is monitored by the executive Directors and senior management.
The Company complies with the requirement of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets by taking positions in index futures and options relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging some or all of the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those particular markets or to enable increased exposure when deemed appropriate.
Price Risk Price risk other than caused by interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments held by the Group.
Management of price risk The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to price risk and take appropriate action to mitigate the risk.
The Group has a widely diversified investment portfolio which significantly reduces the exposure to individual asset price risk.
The performance of third party investment managers is regularly reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance with their mandates and that their performance is compatible with the Groups investment objective.
Exposure to price risk The Groups exposure to pricing risk can be assumed to be equivalent to the investment portfolio, excluding interests in debt securities and including relevant derivatives balances, as set out below: 31 March 31 March 2010 2009 million million Exposure to price risk 1,730.5 1,108.0 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 80 As at the year-end, the Groups exposure to listed equities after adjusting for index futures and unquoted investments represented 95.3% of net assets 31 March 2009: 82.2%.
Price Risk Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS with regards to changes in market prices is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% increase in the fair value of the investments and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into in order to provide a hedge against such movements.
31 March 31 March 2010 2009 Impact on IS Impact on IS & Net Assets & Net Assets million million Total 178.1 100.5 c. Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
Changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value or future cash flows of the following financial assets and liabilities Gilts and other government securities Money market funds Cash and cash equivalents Group borrowings Certain derivative contracts Changes in interest rates indirectly affect the fair value of the Groups investments in quoted and unquoted equity securities.
Management of Interest Rate Risk The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making decisions on investments and borrowings.
The Company uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of future interest payments and this has the effect of increasing the proportion of its fixed interest debt.
Exposure to Interest Rate Risk The Groups exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set and fixed interest rates giving fair value risk, is shown below.
31 March 2010 31 March 2009 Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Rate Rate Total Rate Rate Total million million million million million million Portfolio investments debt securities 69.7 169.9 239.6 51.2 415.3 466.5 Derivative financial instruments 3.9 0.9 3.0 6.8 6.8 Cash 115.3 115.3 98.5 98.5 Bank loans and overdrafts: due within one year 157.6 157.6 0.1 0.1 due after more than one year 133.6 133.6 369.3 369.3 Total Exposure 188.9 122.2 66.7 149.6 52.8 202.4 81 26.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Group arising out of investment, borrowing and risk management processes.
Portfolio investments include direct and indirect via external managed funds investments in government securities, money markets, and unquoted debt securities issued by portfolio companies.
Interest received on cash and cash equivalents is at prevailing market rates.
The Group has total borrowings of 290.3 million outstanding at the year-end 31 March 2009: 369.3 million.
All of the term loans, comprising this total, incur fixed interest payments through the operation of interest rate swaps.
Further details are provided in note 18.
Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis The approximate sensitivity of the Groups net assets and profit and loss in regard to changes in interest rates is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 200 basis points annualised increase in prevailing interest rates at the balance sheet date applied to the floating rate assets and liabilities and the following assumptions: the fair values of assets and liabilities is not affected by a change in interest rates funds will be reinvested in similar interest bearing securities on maturity all other variables are held constant A 200 basis points decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite impact.
31 March 31 March 2010 2009 Impact on IS Impact on IS & Net Assets & Net Assets million million Total 3.8 3.0 d. Currency Risk Consistent with its investment objective, the Group invests in financial instruments and transactions denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
As such, the Groups profits and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements.
Management of Currency Risk The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular currencies.
These contracts are used for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
Part of the Companys currency exposure in respect of its US Dollar and Euro investments is also hedged by way of the Companys borrowings denominated in those currencies.

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS in regard to changes in key currencies is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% strengthening of Sterling relative to the foreign currencies as at 31 March, and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% weakening is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the net foreign currency assets held at the balance sheet dates and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.

Credit Risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument held by the Group will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group which could result in a loss to the Group.
Management of Credit Risk This risk is not considered significant and is managed as follows: The vast majority of the Groups transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis Using a large number of brokers.
Liquid investments cash and cash equivalents are divided between a number of different financial institutions.
The majority of the portfolio investments exposed to credit risk relate to government securities.
A credit exposure could arise in respect of derivative contracts entered into by the Group if the counterparty were unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The Group has exposure to certain debt instruments acquired as part of its private equity transactions.
The credit risk associated with these instruments is managed as part of the overall investment risk in the relevant portfolio companies and is not considered separately.
Exposure to Credit Risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March was: 31 March 31 March 2010 2009 million million Portfolio investments debt securities 233.1 466.5 Derivative financial instruments 42.3 28.4 Other receivables 14.0 13.5 Sales for future settlement 4.9 14.7 Cash at bank 115.3 98.5 Maximum exposure to credit risk 409.6 621.6 The majority of financial assets exposed to credit risk are the Groups liquidity balances which are mainly held by highly rated banks or in highly rated instruments.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Substantially all of the portfolio investments are held by Bank of New York Mellon as custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Groups rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed: however, the custodians subordinated debt was rated A by Fitch in the most recent rating prior to 31 March 2010. f. Liquidity Risk Liquidity Risk is the risk that the Group will have difficulty in meeting its obligations in respect of financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has significant investments in and commitments to unquoted companies and unquoted funds which are inherently illiquid.
In addition the Group holds investments with other third party organisations which may require notice periods in order to be realised.
Management of Liquidity Risk The Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet all of its contractual commitments.
It monitors the level of short-term funding and balances the need for access to short-term funding with the long-term funding needs of the Group.
Exposure to Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is not viewed as significant as a substantial proportion of the Groups net assets are in liquid or readily realisable assets, which could be utilised to meet funding requirements if necessary.
The Company has the power, under its Articles of Association, to take out both short and long-term borrowings.
The Group has existing term facilities totalling 290.3 million details of which are disclosed in Note 18 as well as access to an undrawn committed short-term debt facility of 65.8 million 31 March 2009: 104.6 million.
Of these, 156.7 million was repaid on 17 May 2010.
The Groups contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year-end, based on the earliest date on which payment could be required are as follows: 31 March 2010 31 March 2009 3m or 3m or less 3-12m 1 yr Total less 3-12m 1 yr Total million million million million million million million million Current liabilities Bank loan overdraft 157.6 157.6 0.1 0.1 Other liabilities 47.3 47.3 24.4 24.4 Non current liabilities Bank loans 133.6 133.6 369.3 369.3 Other liabilities 5.3 5.3 13.7 13.7 Total 204.9 138.9 343.8 24.5 383.0 407.5 Commitments 241.6 241.6 220.2 220.2 Total 446.5 138.9 585.4 244.7 383.0 627.7 26.3 Collateral Collateral is posted by the Group in relation to derivative transactions.
These are transacted under ISDA and may require collateral to be posted from time to time.
The Group does not hold collateral from other counterparties.

The notional amount of certain types of financial instruments provides a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but does not necessarily indicate the amount of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the derivatives.
The derivative instruments become favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, security prices or foreign exchange rates relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.

This requires the Group to classify its fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making those measurements.
These are as follows: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Group.
The Group considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
Where adjustments have been required to quoted prices to arrive at fair value, or where a market price is available but the market is not considered active, the Directors have classified these investments as level 2.
The Directors consider all unquoted direct investments and unquoted funds as described in pages 17 to 20 of the Investment Review as level 3 assets, as the valuations of these assets are not based on observable market data.
Where funds within the absolute return and real asset categories invest into illiquid stocks, these are also considered by the Group to be level 3 assets.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 26.6 Capital Management The Groups primary objectives in relation to the management of capital are: to ensure its ability to continue as a going concern to maximise the long-term capital growth for its shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and gearing The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements: the Companys articles restrict borrowings to a cap of five times share capital and reserves, and additionally prohibit the distribution of capital profits as a dividend The Companys borrowings are subject to covenants limiting the total exposure based on a cap of borrowings as a percentage of adjusted net asset value.
All these conditions were met during this and the previous financial year.
In addition, one of the Companys subsidiaries is subject to capital requirements imposed by the Financial Services Authority and that subsidiary must ensure that it has sufficient capital to meet the requirements as set out by the Financial Services Authority.
The subsidiary was in compliance with those capital requirements throughout the year.
The Groups capital at 31 March comprises: 31 March 31 March 2010 2009 million million Equity share capital 153.9 154.5 Retained earnings and other reserves 1,661.8 1,196.0 Net asset value 1,815.7 1,350.5 Bank loans term loans 290.3 369.3 Total Capital 2,106.0 1,719.8 Debt as a % total capital 13.8% 21.5% There have been no significant changes to the Groups capital management objectives, policies and processes in the year, nor has there been any change in what the Group considers to be its capital.
PENSION COMMITMENTS J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The Scheme consists of a defined benefit section which is closed to new members.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
The Group has adopted the revised version of International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits IAS 19, published in December 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of the Schemes assets as reduced by the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method.
The employer contribution rate to the Scheme for the year ended 31 March 2010 was 49.9% of pensionable salaries 31 March 2009: 47%.
It is estimated that the contributions payable to the Scheme during the year ending 31 March 2011 will be 0.8 million 31 March 2010: 0.8 million.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of the assets held.
The full actuarial valuation of the scheme which was carried out as at 1 January 2008 was updated to 31 March 2010 by a qualified independent actuary.
