notes to the consolidated Financial statements 1 accounting policies general information Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC the company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom UK.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the group and equity-account the groups interest in associates.
The parent company financial statements present information about the entity and not about its group.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and, therefore, comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note 2. a Relevant new standards, amendments and interpretations issued and applied in the 2010 financial year IFRS 3 Business Combinations effective for accounting periods beginning on or after July 1 2009.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations with some significant changes.
For example all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt and subsequently re-measured through the Income Statement.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All acquisition-related costs are expensed: IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 requires non-owner changes in equity to be presented separately from owner changes in equity.
As a result, non-owner changes in equity are included in a new primary statement called a Statement of Comprehensive Income.
This change in accounting policy only affects presentational aspects and there is no impact on the groups net assets or income: IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009 requires that, where there is no change in ownership of an existing controlled entity, this is accounted for as an equity transaction, with no adjustment to goodwill or gains or losses.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
This differs from the groups previous approach whereby goodwill was calculated separately for each transaction and the acquirees assets and liabilities were fair valued at the date of acquisition.
The new requirements have been applied prospectively to the purchase of additional interests in controlled entities during the year see note 14 : Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 clarifies the definition of vesting conditions for the purposes of IFRS 2 and introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions.
The amendment has been applied retrospectively in accordance with the relevant transitional provision.
This has had no impact on the group in the year to September 30 2010: Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 amends the criteria for debt or equity classification by permitting certain puttable financial instruments and instruments or components of instruments that impose on an entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation, to be classified as equity, subject to specified criteria being met.
This has had no impact on the group in the year to September 30 2010: IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 requires a management approach under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
This has not resulted in a change to segments reported: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009.
The amendment requires enhanced disclosures in relation to fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements according to the following fair value measurement hierarchy as follows: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
This change in accounting standards results in additional disclosure only see note 19.

This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the groups accounting for its financial assets.
This standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact.
Revised IAS 24 revised Related party disclosures, issued in November 2009 effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2011.
It supersedes IAS 24 Related party disclosures issued in 2003.
IAS 24 revised is mandatory for periods beginning on or after January 1 2011.
Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted.
However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party.
The group is putting systems in place to capture the necessary information.
It is, therefore, not possible at this stage to disclose the impact, if any, of the revised standard on the related party disclosures.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures.
basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
The directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing this report as explained in detail on page 25. basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment.
Cost is adjusted to reflect amendments from contingent consideration.
Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment.
The group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations.
The amount recognised as consideration by the group equates to the fair value of the assets, liabilities and equity acquired by the group plus contingent consideration should there be any such arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at acquisition.
On an  basis, the group recognises any noncontrolling interest in the aquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
To the extent the consideration including the assumed contingent consideration provided by the acquirer is greater than the fair value of the assets and liabilities, this amount is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill also incorporates the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired.
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Step acquisitions Where a business combination is achieved by more than one exchange transaction the previously held interest is treated as if it has been disposed of in return, along with consideration transferred for the controlling interest in the subsidiary.
The fair value of the previously held interest then forms one of the components that is used to calculate goodwill, along with consideration and non-controlling interest less the fair value of identifiable net assets.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 54 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 1 accounting policies continued b Transactions and non-controlling interests Transactions with non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately and included in the groups equity.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and its share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest, in excess of the non-controlling interest in the subsidiarys equity, are allocated against the interests of the group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Where the group owns a non-controlling interest in the equity share capital of a non-quoted company and does not exercise significant influence, it is held as an investment and stated in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
c Associates An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The groups investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
The groups share of associate post-acquisition profit or losses is recognised in the Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the groups share of losses in an associate equals its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the associates.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the Income Statement.
Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The functional and presentation currency of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC and its UK subsidiaries is sterling.
The functional currency of subsidiaries and associates is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings and derivative instruments, to the extent that they are used to provide a hedge against the groups equity investments in overseas undertakings, are taken to equity together with the exchange difference arising on the net investment in those undertakings.
All other exchange differences are taken to the Income Statement.
Group companies The Income Statements of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the weighted average exchange rates for the year and their balance sheets are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken to equity.
In the event of the disposal of an operation, the related cumulative translation differences are recognised in the Income Statement in the period of disposal.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Freehold land do not depreciate Freehold buildings 2% Long-term leasehold premises over term of lease Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Office equipment 11% 33% Motor vehicles 20% intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that have benefited from the acquisition.
Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and may not subsequently be reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on foreign subsidiary investments held in the consolidated balance sheet are retranslated into sterling at the applicable period end exchange rates.
Any exchange differences arising are taken directly to equity as part of the retranslation of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts having been tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP before October 1 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets For all other intangible assets, the group initially makes an assessment of their fair value at acquisition.
An intangible asset will be recognised as long as the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Subsequent to acquisition, amortisation is charged to other intangibles so as to write off the costs of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, using a straight-line or reducing balance method.
All other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as described below.
The costs of acquiring and developing software that are not integral to the related hardware are capitalised separately as an intangible asset.
These intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
amortisation Amortisation of intangible assets is provided on a reducing balance basis or straight-line basis as appropriate over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Brands 2030 years Data provider contracts 5 years Customer relationships 316 years Licences and software 3 years Subscription contracts 1 year Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 56 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 1 accounting policies continued impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Nonfinancial assets, other than goodwill, that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, less provision for impairment.
A provision is made and charged to the Income Statement when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
More information on impairment is included in the impairment of financial assets section below.
cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial assets The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
Classification Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss This category has two sub categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets.
The groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Available-for-sale Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Recognition and measurement Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
All financial assets, other than those carried at fair value through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the profit and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the profit and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.
Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the profit and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income as part of other income when the groups right to receive payments is established.

Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value.
Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Impairment of financial assets The group assesses at each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria that the group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include: Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor: A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: The group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, granting to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider: It becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation: The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties: or Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimate future cash flows from a portfolio of financial asset since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the portfolio, including: i Adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio: and ii National or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
The group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The assets carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the profit and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.
As a practical expedient, the group may measure impairment on the basis of an instruments fair value using an observable market price.
If the assets carrying amount is reduced, the amount of the loss is recognised in the profit and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised such as an improvement in the debtors credit rating, the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Financial liabilities Committed borrowings and bank overdrafts Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the amounts received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to the Income Statement as incurred using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value of the borrowings or overdraft to the extent they are not settled in the period which they arise.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 58 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 1 accounting policies continued Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Derivatives financial instruments The group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps.
All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
The recognition of gains or losses on derivative instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge.
The group designates certain derivatives as either: a hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction cash flow hedge : or b hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation net investment hedge.
The group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the derivative matures in more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the derivative matures in less than 12 months.
Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.
Cash flow hedge The effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognised in the Income Statement immediately.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement for example, when the forecast transaction that is hedged takes place.
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in the Income Statement accordingly, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the Income Statement immediately.
However, whenever the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset for example fixed assets, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset.
The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
When a hedging instruments expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognised as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in the same way as cash flow hedges.
Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income together with the gains and losses on the underlying net investment.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are transferred to the Income Statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.

These discounts are unwound and charged to the Income Statement as notional interest over the period up to the date of the potential future payment.
Taxation The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of IAS 12 Income tax and is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
No provision is made for temporary differences on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries or associates where the group has control and the reversal of the temporary difference is not foreseeable.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Pensions Contributions to pension schemes in respect of current and past service, ex gratia pensions, and cost of living adjustments to existing pensions are based on the advice of independent actuaries.
Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate non-group related entity.
Payments to the Euromoney Pension Plan and the Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan, both defined contribution pension schemes, are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The group also participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme which is operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plan as a whole to the individual entities, the group recognises an expense equal to its contributions payable in the period and does not recognise any unfunded liability of this pension scheme on its balance sheet.
In other words, this scheme is treated as a defined contribution plan.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 60 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 1 accounting policies continued Defined Benefit Plans Defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The group operates the Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.
The present value of providing benefits is determined by triennial valuations using the attained age method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
share-based payments The group makes share-based payments to certain employees which are equity and cash-settled.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At the period end the vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair value of these options updated.
For cash-settled share-based payments a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair value as determined at each balance sheet date.
revenue Revenue represents income from advertising, subscriptions, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
Advertising revenues are recognised in the Income Statement on the date of publication.
Subscription revenues are recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription.
Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognised in the Income Statement over the period the event is run.
Revenues invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred and treated as deferred income in the Statement of Financial Position.
leased assets Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line or other systematic basis as allowed by IAS 17 Leases.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Own shares held by employees share Ownership Trust Transactions of the group-sponsored trust are included in the group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts holdings of shares in the company are debited direct to equity.
earnings per share The earnings per share and diluted earnings per share calculations follow the provisions of IAS 33 Earnings per share.
The diluted earnings per share figure is calculated by adjusting for the dilution effect of the exercise of all ordinary share options, SAYE options and the Capital Appreciation Plan options granted by the company, but excluding the ordinary shares held by the Euromoney Employees Share Ownership Trust.
exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income or expense considered by the directors, either individually or if of a similar type in aggregate, as being either material or significant and which require additional disclosure in order to provide an indication of the underlying trading performance of the group.
segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the board and executive committee members who are responsible for strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 61 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Company Accounts Group Accounts Our Governance Our Performance notes to the consolidated Financial statements continued 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these financial statements The group prepares its group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the application of which often requires judgements to be made by management when formulating the groups financial position and results.
Under IFRS, the directors are required to adopt those accounting policies most appropriate to the groups circumstances for the purpose of presenting fairly the groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the reported results or net asset position of the group should it later be determined that a different choice would have been more appropriate.
Management considers the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed below to be its key judgemental areas and, accordingly, provides an explanation of each below.
Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the groups audit committee.
The discussion below should also be read in conjunction with the groups disclosure of IFRS accounting policies, which is provided in note 1. acquisitions The groups accounting policy is that on acquisition of a subsidiary or business, the purchase consideration is allocated over the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Fair value Determining the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired requires managements judgement and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, recoverability of assets, and unprovided liabilities and commitments particularly in relation to tax and VAT.
Intangible assets The group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
The measurement of the fair value of intangible assets acquired requires significant management judgement particularly in relation to the expected future cash flows from the acquired marketing databases which are generally based on managements estimate of marketing response rates, trademarks, brands, repeat and well established events.
At September 30 2010 the net book value of intangible assets was 124.7 million 2009: 134.0 million.
Goodwill Goodwill is impaired where the carrying value of goodwill is higher than the net present value of future cash flows of those cash generating units to which it relates.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the net present value are the forecast cash flows, the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
During the year the group recognised a goodwill impairment of 1.2 million 2009: 21.9 million note 5.
Goodwill held on the Statement of Financial Position at September 30 2010 was 297.6 million 2009: 291.3 million.
Acquisition option commitments The group is party to a number of put and call options over the remaining minority interests in some of its subsidiaries.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires the discounted present value of these acquisition option commitments to be recognised as a liability on the balance sheet with a corresponding decrease in reserves.
The discounts are unwound as a notional interest charge to the Income Statement.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the discounted present value of the options are the expected future cash flows and earnings of the business, the period remaining until the option is exercised and the discount rate.
At September 30 2010 the discounted present value of these acquisition option commitments was 1.1 million 2009: 11.9 million.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 62 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these financial statements continued share-based payments The group makes long-term incentive payments to certain employees.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the groups share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives.
These assumptions are set out in note 24.
Management regularly perform a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest, which is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
The charge for long-term incentive payments for the year ended September 30 2010 is 4.4 million 2009: 2.7 million.
Defined benefit pension scheme The surplus or deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme that is recognised through the Statement of Comprehensive Income is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties.
The calculated liabilities of the scheme are based on assumptions regarding salary increases, inflation rates, discount rates, the long-term expected return on the schemes assets and member longevity.
Details of the assumptions used are shown in note 27.
Such assumptions are based on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against similar pension schemes.
Taxation The groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The group is a multi-national group with tax affairs in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to a higher than usual complexity to the groups tax structure and makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the group and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legislative processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which the group operates.
Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the Income Statement and tax payments.
The group has certain significant open items in several tax jurisdictions and as a result the amounts recognised in the group financial statements in respect of these items are derived from the groups best estimation and judgement, as described above.
However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these items means eventual resolution could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore affect the groups results and cash flows.
recognition of deferred tax assets The recognition of net deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Historical differences between forecast and actual taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of deferred tax assets.
At September 30 2010, the group had a deferred tax asset of 20.8 million 2009: 18.5 million.

The maturity profile of these derivatives is matched with the expected future debt profile of the group.
The groups policy is to fix the interest rates on approximately 80% of its term debt looking forward over five years.
The expected future debt profile of the group is based on estimates of both timings and size of future, as yet unknown, acquisitions offset by an estimate of the cash generated by the group over a five year period.
If management materially underestimate the groups future debt profile this would lead to too few interest rate instruments being in place and the group more exposed to swings in interest rates.
An overestimate of the groups future debt profile would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess interest rate instruments.
At September 30 2010, the fair value of the groups interest rate swaps was a 5.9 million liability 2009: 7.6 million liability.
Forward contracts The group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the form of transactions in foreign currencies entered into by group companies and by the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into sterling for reporting purposes.
The group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries, consequently, fluctuations in the value of sterling versus foreign currencies could materially affect the amount of these items in the consolidated financial statements, even if their values have not changed in their original currency.
The group does endeavour to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Approximately two-thirds of the groups revenues are in US dollars.
Subsidiaries normally do not hedge transactions in foreign currencies into the functional currency of their own operations.
However, at a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 18 months forward partially to hedge its dollar revenues into sterling.
The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on managements estimate of its future US dollar revenues over a 18 month period.
If management materially underestimated the groups future US dollar revenues this would lead to too few forward contracts being in place and the group being more exposed to swings in US dollar to sterling exchange rates.
An overestimate of the groups US dollar revenue would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess forward contracts.
At September 30 2010, the fair value of the groups forward contracts was a net liability of 7.8 million 2009: 15.8 million and the foreign exchange loss on restructured hedging arrangements from unwinding excess forward contracts was nil 2009: 7.9 million note 7.
Details of the financial instruments used are set out in note 19 to the accounts.

This foreign exchange loss was matched by an equal and opposite tax credit so that there was no financial impact on earnings per share.
The foreign exchange loss and the tax credit were excluded from underlying profit and the underlying tax expense note 8.

The group presents the above underlying effective tax rate to help users of this report better understand its tax charge.
In arriving at this rate, the group removes the tax effect of items which are adjusted for in arriving at the underlying profit disclosed in the appendix to the Chairmans Statement.
However, the current tax effect of goodwill and intangible items is not removed.
The group considers that the resulting underlying effective tax rate is more representative of its tax payable position, as the deferred tax effect of the goodwill and intangible items is not expected to crystallise.

The impact of changes in statutory tax rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% from April 1 2011 which was enacted on July 27 2010.
This change has resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.
The UK government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main tax rate of 1% each year down to 24% by April 1 2014.
Management estimate that the future tax rate changes would further reduce the UK deferred tax asset recognised but the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at that time.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units businesses that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
During the year the goodwill in respect of each of the above businesses was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
The methodology applied to the value in use calculations, reflecting past experience and external sources of information, included: Forecasts by business based on pre-tax cash flows derived from approved budgets for 2011.
Management believe these budgets to be reasonably achievable: Subsequent cash flows for between one and three additional years increased in line with growth expectations of the applicable business: The pre-tax discount rate of 10.3%, reflecting the companies weighted average cost of capital: and Long-term nominal growth rate of 3%.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 74 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 11 goodwill and other intangibles continued Impairment Due to current market conditions an impairment of capitalised goodwill of 1,214,000 2009: 21,929,000 was recognised in the year.
This is limited to its Asia-based conference organiser and training business which has not yet recovered from the decline in its customers spend on training.
This business is part of the conferences and seminars business division.
Sensitivities Certain businesses, after the annual impairment review required under IAS 36, had a limited value in use in excess of the carrying value of 5.0 million.
For these businesses management has set out below the change in assumptions required, in isolation, in order for the estimated carrying value to be equal or less than the value in use.
The change in assumptions are summarised as follows: Increase in the WACC by 1% point.
Decrease in the long-term growth rate by 1%.
The result of the change in assumptions of a 1% decrease in growth rates or a 1% increase in WACC would not result in any additional impairment.
1 Exceptional depreciation in 2009 related to the rationalisation of the groups property portfolio.

The Arete group contributed 393,000 to the groups revenue, 66,000 to the groups operating profit and 66,000 to the groups profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and September 30 2010.
Increase in equity holdings IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009 requires that, where there is no change in ownership of an existing controlled entity, an increase in equity is accounted for as an equity transaction, with no adjustment to goodwill or gains and losses.
The new requirements have been applied to the purchase of additional interests in controlled entities during the year as set out below.
In October 2009, the group purchased the final 5% of the equity share capital of Coaltrans Conferences Limited for a cash consideration of 1,341,000.
In January 2010, the group exercised its option to purchase the final 10.8% of the equity share capital of Total Derivatives Limited for a cash consideration of 1,820,000.

Trade receivables beyond 60 days overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Credit terms for customers are determined in individual territories.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the groups customer base being large and diverse.
Due to this, management believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
As of September 30 2010, trade receivables of 11,461,000 2009: 12,415,000 were past due for which the group has not provided as there has been no significant change in their credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The average age of these receivables is 65 days 2009: 59 days.
The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The ageing of these trade receivables is as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s Past due less than a month 6,848 8,618 Past due more than a month but less than two months 2,627 2,510 Past due more than two months but less than three months 784 703 Past due more than three months 1,202 584 11,461 12,415 As at September 30 2010, trade receivables of 12,166,000 2009: 11,524,000 were impaired and partially provided for.
It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts does not include individually impaired trade receivables which have been placed under liquidation as these trade receivables are written off directly to the income statement.

Full details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the group in relation to financial risk management are set out on page 57 of the accounting policies and page 64 of the key judgemental areas.
In summary, the groups tax and treasury committee normally meets twice a year and is responsible for recommending policy to the board.
The groups treasury policies are directed to giving greater certainty of future costs and revenues and ensuring that the group has adequate liquidity for working capital and debt capacity for funding acquisitions.
The treasury department does not act as a profit centre, nor does it undertake any speculative trading activity and it operates within policies and procedures approved by the board.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings.
Further details are set out in the interest rate risk section on page 82.
Forward contracts are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements.
Further details are set out in the foreign exchange rate risk section below.
capital risk management The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 23 and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Net debt to EBITDA ratio The groups tax and treasury committee reviews the capital structure at least twice a year.
As part of the debt covenants under the loan facility provided by Daily Mail and General Trust plc DMGT, the board has to ensure that net debt to a rolling 12 month EBITDA does not exceed four times.
The group expects to be able to remain within these limits during the life of the facility.
The net debt to EBITDA covenant is defined to allow the rate used in the translation of US dollar EBITDA, including hedging contracts, to be used also in the calculation of net debt, thereby removing any distortion to the covenant from increases in net debt due to short-term movements in the US dollar.
The net debt to EBITDA ratio at September 30 is as follows: 2010 2009 000s 000s Committed loan facility 135,679 165,151 Loan notes 2,039 5,719 Total debt 137,718 170,870 Cash and cash equivalents 11,190 12,063 Net debt 126,528 158,807 EBITDA 98,903 79,769 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 1.28 1.99 EBITDA Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation underlying operating profit before depreciation and amortisation of licences and software.

The groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by the group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, currency options and forward exchange contracts are set out in this note and represent the value for which an asset could be sold or liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction calculated using the market rates of interest and exchange at September 30 2010.
The group has no other material market price risks.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
There has been no change to the groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks during the year.
i Foreign exchange rate risk The groups principal foreign exchange exposure is to US dollar.
The group generates approximately two-thirds of its revenues in US dollars, including approximately 30% of the revenues in its UK-based businesses, and approximately 60% of its operating profits are US dollar-denominated.
The group is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk on the US dollar revenues in its UK businesses and external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower.
The carrying amounts of the groups US dollar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2010 2009 2010 2009 000s 000s 000s 000s US dollar 13,390 12,608 30,219 59,720 Approximately two-thirds of the groups revenues are in US dollars.
However, at a group level, a series of US dollar forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars so as to hedge 80% of the groups UK based US dollar revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% of the groups UK based US dollar revenues for the subsequent six months.
The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on managements estimate of its future US dollar revenues over a 18 month period and is regularly reviewed and revised with any changes in estimates resulting in either additional forward contracts being taken out or existing contracts maturity dates being moved forward or back.
The group also has a significant operation in Canada whose revenues are mainly in US dollars.
At a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the operations Canadian cost base.
In addition, each subsidiary is encouraged to invoice sales in its local functional currency where possible.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 82 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 19 Financial instruments continued Forward exchange contracts are gross settled at maturity.
The following table details the groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against US dollar.
A 10% sensitivity has been determined by the board as the sensitivity rate appropriate when reporting an estimated foreign currency risk internally and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates at the reporting date.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower.
Where sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency a positive number below indicates an increase in profit and equity.
For a 10% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
impact of 10% strengthening of sterling against us dollar 2010 2009 000s 000s Change in profit for the year in income statement 132 106 Change in equity 7,596 11,092 The change in the profit to a loss from the sensitivity analysis is due to a change in the net working capital balance moving from a net liability to a net asset.
The fall in profit in equity from 11,092,000 to 7,596,000 from the sensitivity analysis is due to the decrease of the value of the derivative financial liabilities.
The group is also exposed to the translation of the results of its US dollar-denominated businesses, although the group does not hedge the translation of this results.
Consequently, fluctuations in the value of sterling versus other currencies could materially affect the translation of these results in the consolidated financial statements.
The group endeavours to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries with the related foreign currency interest cost arising from these borrowings providing a partial hedge against the translation of foreign currency profits.
The change in equity due to a 10% change in sterling against US dollars in relation to the translation of external loans and loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower would result in a decrease of 549,000 2009: 2,313,000.
However, the change in equity is completely offset by the change in value of the foreign operations net assets from their translation into sterling.

In 2009, the directors reviewed the groups hedging policy and as a result reduced the period of hedging from up to 48 months to 18 months and reduced the percentage of revenues hedged in the first 12 months to 80%.
The transition to the revised policy will take some time, with forward deals in excess of 18 months being allowed to naturally unwind.
It is anticipated that the transactions will take place over the next 24 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released to the Income Statement.
As at September 30 2010, the aggregate amount of unrealised losses under ineffective cash flow hedges still in place at the year end is 1,072,000 2009: 4,510,000, which have been recognised in the Income Statement.
ii Interest rate risk The groups borrowings are in both sterling and US dollars with the related interest tied to LIBOR.
This results in the groups interest charge being at risk to fluctuations in interest rates.
It is the groups policy to hedge approximately 80% of its interest exposure, converting its floating rate debt into fixed debt by means of interest rate swaps.
The maturity dates are spread in order to avoid interest rate basis risk and also to negate shortterm changes in interest rates.
The predictability of interest costs is deemed to be more important than the possible opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower interest rates and this hedging strategy has the effect of spreading the groups exposure to fluctuations arising from changes in interest rates and hence protects the groups interest charge against sudden increases in rates but also prevents the group from benefiting immediately from falls in rates.
The groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section on page 86.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates at the reporting date.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the groups: Profit for the year ended September 30 2010 would decrease or increase by 337,000 2009: 199,000.
This is mainly attributable to the groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings: and Other equity reserves would decrease or increase by 2,129,000 2009: 2,501,000 mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
The groups sensitivity to interest rates has not materially changed during the period due to the group benefiting from similar levels of fixed rates.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 84 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 19 Financial instruments continued Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: cash flow hedges us dollar: Receive floating pay fixed Average contracted Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 % % 000s 000s 000s 000s Less than 1 year 3.64 4.28 31,730 40,640 793 1,276 1 to 2 years 3.98 3.64 34,903 31,262 2,024 1,448 2 to 5 years 3.07 4.21 25,384 40,640 1,600 2,812 gbP: Receive floating pay fixed Average contracted Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 % % 000s 000s 000s 000s Less than 1 year 4.02 5.73 22,000 15,000 413 385 1 to 2 years 4.46 5.68 15,000 12,000 896 779 2 to 5 years 2.57 5.53 5,000 10,000 129 888 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is LIBOR.
The group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in the Income Statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact the Income Statement.
As at September 30 2010, the aggregate amount of unrealised interest under swap contracts deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future interest payable is 5,855,000 2009: 7,580,000.
It is anticipated that the transactions will take place over the next 48 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released to the Income Statement.
As at September 30 2010, the aggregate amount of unrealised interest under ineffective swaps still in place at the year end is nil 2009: 8,000 which has been recognised in the Income Statement.
credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.
The group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign currency risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the amounts outstanding with, and the credit quality of, these counterparties.
For the groups cash and cash equivalents these are principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and for derivative financial instruments with DMGT who have treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA.
The group also has credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the groups large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk of non-payment taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.

The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
liquidity risk The group has significant intercompany borrowings and is an approved borrower under a DMGT $400 million dedicated multi-currency borrowing facility.
The facility is divided into four quantums of US dollar and sterling funds with three and five year terms with a total maximum borrowing capacity of $310 million 197 million and 59 million.
Interest is payable on this facility at a variable rate of between 1.3% and 3.0% above LIBOR dependent on the ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA.
The facilitys covenant requires the groups net debt to be no more than four times adjusted EBITDA on a rolling 12 month basis.
Failure to do so would result in the group being in breach of the facility, potentially resulting in the facility being withdrawn or impediment of management decision making by the lender.
Management regularly monitor the covenant and prepare detailed debt forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not close or potentially close to breach.
The groups strategy is to use excess operating cash to pay down its debt.
The group has a cash conversion rate the percentage by which cash generated by operations covers operating profit before acquired intangible amortisation, share option expense and exceptional items of 101% 2009: 91%, due to much of its subscription, conference and training revenue being paid in advance.
The three year quantums of the facility are due for renewal in December 2011 and the five year quantums in December 2013.
Under the DMGT facility, at September 30 2010, the group has 117.8 million of undrawn but committed facilities available to draw upon if required.
This is more than sufficient for the group to meet expected and unexpected short-term working capital requirements.
However, given the level of uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, there is a risk that the undrawn portion of the facility may be unavailable or withdrawn if DMGT experience funding difficulties themselves.
It is, however, unlikely that this would impact the group as DMGT have a wide range of funding sources, other than bank debt, available to them.
In addition, if DMGT were unable to fulfil its commitment to the group the directors are confident that the group is in a position that would enable it to secure adequate facilities outside of DMGT, albeit at an increased cost to the business due to high interest charges imposed given the crisis in the credit markets.
The following table details the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, mainly variable borrowings.
This table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual cash flows of the financial liabilities including both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that the interest rates are floating, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at September 30 2010.
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the group may be required to settle.

At September 30 2010 a deferred tax asset of 2,744,000 2009: 4,515,000 has been recognised in relation to these losses.
The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date they arose.
The US losses have expiry dates between 2010 and 2029.
At the balance sheet date, the group has unused UK tax losses available for offset against future profits.
At September 30 2010 a deferred tax asset of 7,885,000 2009: 1,165,000 has been recognised in relation to these losses.
UK losses have no expiry dates.
At the balance sheet date, a net deferred tax asset of 10,190,000 2009: 12,794,000 has been recognised in respect of US tax deductible goodwill amortisation, capitalised intangible assets and other short-term timing differences.
The directors are of the opinion that, based on recent and forecast trading, it is probable that the level of profits in future years is sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 40,652,000 2009: 24,363,000 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at September 30 2010 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

2 The allocation of the number of options granted under each tranche of the CAP 2010 and CSOP UK and CSOP Canada represents the directors best estimate.
The CAP 2010 award is reduced by the number of options vesting under the respective CSOP schemes see below and the Directors Remuneration Report for further details.
Options granted relate to those that are likely to vest on February 11 2011 under the second and third tranche of the CAP 2004 following the achievement of the additional performance test.
The number of options granted is provisional and will primarily require a true-up to reflect adjustments of the individual businesses profits during the period to December 31 2010 as required by the Remuneration Committee.
As such the actual number of options vested could vary from that disclosed.
capital appreciation Plan 2010 caP 2010 The CAP 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on January 21 2010 and is a revised version of and replaces the previously approved CAP 2009.
CAP 2010 is the direct replacement for CAP 2004 as no further awards may be granted under CAP 2004.
Each CAP 2010 award comprises two equal elements an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company at an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share, and a right to receive a cash payment.
The awards will vest in two equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards become exercisable on satisfaction of the primary or secondary performance condition and lapse to the extent unexercised by September 30 2020.
The second tranche of awards becomes exercisable in a subsequent financial year in which the profits achieved in the year of initial vesting are again achieved.
The second tranche only vests on satisfaction of the primary or secondary performance condition and an additional performance condition.
The number of options received under the share award of the CAP 2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from the 2010 Company Share Option Plan see page 92.

The CSOP 2010 UK was approved by HM Revenue and Customs on June 21 2010 and granted on June 28 2010.
The CSOP 2010 UK option enables each participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in the company at a price of 6.03 per share, the market value at the date of grant.
The options will vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding share award under the CAP 2010 providing the CSOP option is in the money at that time and does not vest before June 28 2013.
The CSOP 2010 Canada, granted on March 30 2010, enables each participant to purchase up to 19,960 shares in the company at a price of 5.01 per share, the market value at the date of grant.
No option may vest after the date falling three months after the preliminary announcement of the results for the financial year ended September 30 2019, and the option shall lapse to the extent unvested at the time.
The CSOP has the same performance criteria as that of the CAP 2010 as set out on page 91.
The number of CSOP 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010 as the CSOP is effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 award.
The CSOP 2010 option exercise price of 6.03 UK and 5.01 Canada will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism and results in the same net gain on the CSOP options calculated as the market price of the companys shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the award had been delivered using 0.25p CAP options.
capital appreciation Plan 2004 caP 2004 The CAP 2004 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on February 1 2005.
Each of the CAP awards comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share.
The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on September 30 2014.
The initial performance condition was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the option pool a maximum of 7.5 million shares was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards.
One-third of the awards vested immediately.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 2,241,269 options from the second tranche of options vested in February 2009.
The primary performance target was also achieved in 2009 and 1,521,498 options including a true-up adjustment of 5,654 for the third final tranche of options in 2009 vested in February 2010.
For those individual participants businesses where the additional performance conditions for the second and final tranche have not been met, the vesting is deferred until the profits are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending September 30 2012.
The directors estimate 303,321 of options will vest in February 2011 following satisfaction of the additional performance test.
share Option schemes The company has 15 share option schemes for which an IFRS 2 Share based payments charge has been recognised.
Details of these schemes are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 32 to 34.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are shown below: The executive and Save as You Earn Options SAYE were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over a period of 14 years.
The executive options fair values have been discounted at a rate of 10% to reflect their performance conditions.

The number of CSOP 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010: the CSOP is effectively 1 a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 award.
The CSOP 2010 options have an exercise price of 6.03, which will be satisfied by a 2 funding award mechanism which results in the same net gain on these options delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the same award had been delivered using 0.25p CAP options.
The amount of the funding award will depend on the companys share price at the date of exercise.
Because of the above and the other direct links between the CSOP 2010 and the CAP 2010, including the identical performance criteria, IFRS 2 Share based payments combines the two plans and treats them as one plan vesting in two tranches.

Under both plans, contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
However, Euromoney PensionSaver is a group personal pension arrangement rather than the trust-based arrangement used by the Euromoney Pension Plan.
Under both schemes, employees are able to contribute a minimum of 3% of salary with an equal company contribution in the first three years of employment and thereafter at twice the employee contribution rate, up to a maximum employer contribution of 10% of salary.
The Euromoney Pension Plan is a part of the DMGT Pension Trust, an umbrella trust under which DMGT UK trust-based defined contribution plans are held.
Insured death benefits previously held under this trust have been transferred to a new trust-based arrangement specifically for life assurance purposes.
When the process of transferring out the remaining assets of the Euromoney Pension Plan has been completed the Plan will be wound up.
Assets of both plans are invested in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
The investment and administration of both plans is undertaken by Fidelity Pension Management.
metal bulletin group Personal Pension Plan The Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The scheme is closed to new members.
The plan is contracted-in to the State Second Pension and its assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Skandia Life Group.
Private schemes Institutional Investor, Inc. contributes to a 401 k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 15% of salary with the company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 5% of salary.
stakeholder pensions The company provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for other pension schemes operated by the group.
Harmsworth Pension scheme The Harmsworth Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme operated by DMGT providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances and are administered by a trustee company.
The scheme is no longer offered to new employees of the company.
The contributions payable to the scheme are determined by the trustee company after taking advice from an independent qualified actuary, and following agreement with the company.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme, upon which the current contributions are based, was carried out as at March 31 2007 using the projected unit credit method.
DMGT continues to develop a series of measures affecting the Harmsworth Pension Scheme that are principally designed to limit the companys exposure to people living longer than is currently expected.
The measures are being discussed with scheme trustees and a formal process of employee consultation will begin as soon as these proposals have been finalised.
DMGT expects that this package of changes will secure the future of the scheme which continues to provide a valuable retirement provision for scheme members.
The funding strategy agreed with the Trustee of the principal scheme made allowance for assumed future investment returns on the schemes assets of 3.3% p. a. above price inflation, compared with the real return of some 2.6% p. a. implicit within the calculation of the Technical Provisions i. e. the value of the schemes benefit liabilities.
DMGT agreed with the Trustee that this margin would be covered by a contingent asset and DMGT has put in place a letter of credit to be updated annually of an amount sufficient to cover any potential shortfall in this additional investment return arising prior to the next triennial valuation.
As at October 3 2010, the letter of credit had a value of 46.9 million 2009: 32.1 million.
Post year-end, on October 5 2010, DMGT made a funding payment of 8.6 million in exchange for which the trustee agreed that the letter of credit could be reduced by a corresponding amount.

However, since January 1 2009 a majority of members have agreed to a salary sacrifice arrangement whereby the company pays the equivalent of the employees contribution in exchange for a corresponding reduction in salary.
In addition, DMGT agreed to make a series of funding payments amounting to 3.2 million over a period of 27 months commencing in September 2009.
In the year to October 3 2010 DMGT paid 1.0 million in accordance with that agreement 2009: 1.0 million.
long-term assumed rate of: Price inflation 3.0% p. a.
Pension increases on excess over guaranteed minimum pension 3.0% p. a.
Discount rate for accrued liabilities Pre-retirement 6.4% p. a. Post-retirement 4.8% p. a.
The financial assumptions shown above used in the most recent actuarial valuation were selected to provide a basis for funding the schemes and are not intended to reflect the companys experience or policy regarding pay in any one financial year.
The valuation of the scheme showed that the combined accumulated assets of the scheme as at March 31 2007 represented 99% of the schemes Technical Provisions in respect of past service benefits.
However, in common with the majority of defined benefit schemes, there was a sharp deterioration over the following two years, with the equivalent funding level falling to 63% as at March 31 2009.
Recent quarterly updates provided to the Trustee indicate that the funding position has since improved.
Members are able to make additional voluntary contributions AVCs into unit-linked funds held within each scheme.
No benefit obligation arises to the DMGT, or the company, from these AVCs and the related unit-linked AVC assets have been excluded from the valuation of assets and liabilities reported below.
The groups pension charge for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme for the year ended September 30 2010 was 191,000 2009: 207,000.
The group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the schemes as a whole.
The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
DMGT, is required to account for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The IAS 19 disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts of DMGT have been based on calculations performed as part of the work being carried out for the formal valuation of the scheme as at March 31 2007, and adjusted to October 3 2010 to take account of membership data as at September 30 2010.
The calculations are adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19.
These showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1,342.6 million 2009: 1,228.4 million and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 86.2% 2009: 78% of the benefits that had accrued to members also calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
Defined benefit scheme The company operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme closed to new members, a defined benefit scheme.
metal bulletin Pension scheme The Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme MBPS is a defined benefit scheme providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances, being invested with the Norwich Union Life Insurance Society, Schroder Investment Management Ltd, and certain other specific investments managed directly by the Trustees.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the group.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme, upon which the current contributions are based, was carried out as at June 1 2007.
The company cash contribution rate to the scheme during the year was 22.3% 2009: 22.8% of pensionable salaries.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 96 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 27 retirement benefit schemes continued This MBPS is closed to new members.
The figures in this note are based on calculations carried out in connection with the actuarial valuation of the scheme as at June 1 2007 and adjusted to September 30 2010 by the actuary.
The key financial assumptions adopted were as follows: 2010 2009 long-term assumed rate of: Pensionable salary growth 4.6% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pre January 1997 members 5.0% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pensions earned from May 30 2002 to June 30 2006 post January 1997 members 3.3% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pensions earned from June 30 2006 post January 1997 members 2.5% p. a.
Discount rate for accrued liabilities 5.0% p. a.
Pension increase in deferment 3.3% p. a.
The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.
All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.
