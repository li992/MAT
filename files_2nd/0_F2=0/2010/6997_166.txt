Goodwill of 253.1m arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is allocated to Retail.

The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calculations for each of the two Groups of cash-generating units, being Retail and Car Servicing.
This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Groups operating segments as reported in Note 1.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration of all available information.
The key assumptions used to determine value-in-use of goodwill held at 2 April 2010 and 3 April 2009 are as follows: Car Retail Servicing Note 2010 2009 2010 2009 Discount rate 1 12.2% 12.6% 13.9% n a Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% n a Notes: 1.
Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.
