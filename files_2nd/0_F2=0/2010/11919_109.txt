Financial risk management continued Financial instruments sensitivity analysis continued The table shows the sensitivities of the fair values of each class of financial instruments to an isolated change in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
The class Other net financial assets comprises trade assets less trade liabilities.
The sensitivities of derivative instruments are calculated using established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
Where modelling an interest rate decrease of 1% led to negative interest rates, these points on the yield curve were adjusted to 0%.
A large proportion of the movements shown above would impact equity rather than the income statement, depending on the location and functional currency of the entity in which they arise and the availability of net investment hedge treatment.
The changes in valuations are estimates of the impact of changes in market variables and are not a prediction of future events or anticipated gainsor losses.
