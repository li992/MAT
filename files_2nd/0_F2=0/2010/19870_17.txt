The effectiveness of the hedge must be capable of reliable measurement and must be assessed as highly effective on an ongoing basis throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.

Fair value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amounts for which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 898,750,000 2009: 710,485,000 which is also the fair value.
The property valuer is external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Manager advises of the presence of such materials.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 18 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Group's investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
In addition to the above, the property portfolio market value as at 31 December 2010 is partly based on the following: The Estimated Net Annual Rent for each property, which is based on the current rental value of each of the properties, which reflects the terms of the leases where the property, or part of the property, are let at the date of valuation.
If the property, or parts thereof, are vacant at the date of valuation, the rental value reflects the rent the valuer considers would be obtainable on an open market letting as at the date of valuation The valuer has assumed that all rent reviews are upward only and are to be assessed by reference to full current rents.
Also there is the assumption that all tenants will meet their obligations under their leases, and are responsible for insurance, payment of business rates, and all repairs, whether directly or by means of a service charge.
The valuer has not made any adjustments to reflect any liability to taxation that may arise on disposal, nor any costs associated with disposals incurred by the owner.
The valuer assumes an initial yield in the region of 5 to 7% for the majority of the properties, with the reversionary yield being in the region of 7%.
UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 34 The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to its investment properties.
Included within the total market value of the property portfolio, are: Units in the Kensington High Street Jersey Property Unit Trust which holds the property at Kensington High Street, London.

The fair value of the liability in respect of the interest rate swap contract at 31 December 2010 is 1,353,000 which is based on the marked to market value.
Interest is payable by the Company at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the Gross Assets Value, expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage.
Gross Assets Value takes onto account the value of the properties and any other assets held by the Company and the Guarantors currently UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited, UK Commercial Property GP Limited and UKCPT Limited Partnership as well as unsecured cash, if the LTV Percentage is greater than 5 per cent and does not exceed 10 per cent, the margin is 0.55 per cent per annum.

Financial Instruments The Groups investment objective is to provide Ordinary Shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments consist of cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and remained unchanged during the year.
Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not different from the carrying value in the financial statements.
Fair value hierarchy The following table shows an analysis of the fair values of financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy: 2009: nil 31 December 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swap - 1,353 - 1,353 Explanation of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 - Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 - Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of the derivative interest rate swap contract is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curve over the remaining term of the instrument.
Market risk A 10 per cent increase in the value of the investment properties held as at 31 December 2010 would have increase net assets available to shareholders and increased the net profit by 89.9 million 2009: 71.0 million.
A 10 per cent decrease in value would have reduced net assets available to shareholders and reduced the net profit by 89.9 million 2009: 71.0 million.
The calculations above are based on investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole, nor reflective of future market conditions.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Assets 2010 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 80,937 - - 80,937 Rent receivable 806 - - 806 Other debtors - - 571 571 81,743 - 571 82,314 Financial Assets 2009 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 70,163 - - 70,163 Rent receivable 1,644 - - 1,644 Other debtors 23 - 508 531 71,830 - 508 72,338 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 38 In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Investment Manager monitor such reports in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults by occupational tenants.
The Company has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2010 is 806,000 2009: 1,644,000.
The Group holds rental deposits of 571,000 2009: 508,000 held as collateral against tenant arrears defaults.
There is no credit risk associated with the financial liabilities of the Group.
All of the cash is placed with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
46m 2009: nil of the year end cash balance is held in the Ignis Liquidity Fund: which is a money market fund.
Bankruptcy or insolvency may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, the Investment Manager would move the cash holdings to another financial institution.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise UK commercial property.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Investment Manager and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups bank loan entitles the lender to require early repayment, and in such circumstances the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the ordinary shares could be adversely affected.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups liabilities was: Financial Liabilities 2010 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan and interest rate swap 377 1,131 47,917 49,425 Other Creditors 17,260 - 571 17,831 17,637 1,131 48,488 67,256 Financial Liabilities 2009 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan 121 362 44,251 44,734 Other Creditors 12,255 1,416 508 14,179 12,376 1,778 44,759 58,913 Interest rate risk The cash balance as shown in the Balance Sheet, is its carrying amount and has a maturity of less than 1 year.
Interest is receivable on cash at a variable rate ranging between 0.2 per cent to 0.5 per cent at the year end and deposits are re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
An increase of 1 per cent in interest rates as at the reporting date would have increased the reported profit by 809,000 2009: reduced the reported loss by 280,000.
A decrease of 1 per cent would have reduced the reported profit by 809,000 2009: increased the reported loss by 280,000.
The effect on equity is nil excluding the impact of a charge in retained earnings as a result of a change in net profit.
As the Companys bank loan has been hedged by its swap, this loan is not subject to interest rate risk.
The other financial assets and liabilities of Group are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Foreign Currency Risk There was no foreign currency risk as at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009 as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds Sterling.
