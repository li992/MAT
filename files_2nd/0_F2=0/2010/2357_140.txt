A 292,000 tax asset has not been recognised in relation to subsidiary entity tax losses that are unable to be immediately relieved.
Non-current trade payables The Group recognises differences between the fair value and nominal value of long term creditors relating to purchases of land for development and charges these differences as finance costs using the effective interest method.
The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost is charged on legal completion of the house sale.
As at 31 December 2010, 10,626,000 2009: 11,197,000 of finance costs had not received a tax deduction.
The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a deficit of 2.9 million 2009: 8.9 million.
As at 31 December 2010 a deferred tax asset of 776,000 2009: 2,492,000 was recognised.

During 2010, a 3.8 million reversal of write downs was recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as expenses in respect of units sold during the year.
