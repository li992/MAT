The fair value of interest rate swaps is measured by reference to the cost of foreclosing the swap position at the year end.
The fair value of the senior notes and the swaps are measured by reference to observable market interest rate information as no similar instrument is available due to the specific profiles of the loans.
They are considered to be level two in the fair value hierarchy.
None of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps is attributable to changes in the Groups credit risk.
Risk management The Group is exposed to market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Group Treasury is charged with managing and controlling risk relating to the financing and liquidity of the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury does not enter into speculative transactions.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Shanks Group plc 92 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Interest rate risk The Group has reduced its exposure to interest rate risk during the year by entering into a two year interest rate swap fixing a substantial part of the Groups core borrowings.
The senior notes remain at fixed rates.
The debt relating to project finance non-recourse borrowings is at floating rates and the Group has entered into interest rate swaps as a condition of the related debt.
The interest rate swaps represent a hedge of the interest cash flows.
The interest rate swaps entered into after 31 March 2009 are accounted for under IAS 39 hedge accounting with changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps being recognised directly in reserves as they are effective hedges.
Any other outstanding interest rate swaps have not previously been allocated as hedges by the Group and are therefore classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39.
The swaps are presented in non-current liabilities together with the related long term borrowings since the Group believes this best reflects the commercial reality of the instruments.
Changes in interest rates could have a significant impact on banking covenants relating to interest cover and on the interest charge in the income statement.
The Group manages this risk by fixing the interest rates on a proportion of its total borrowings.
In order to measure the risk, borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a quarterly basis and scenarios run using managements expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year.
The Groups exposure is significantly reduced.
The weighted average effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2010 2009 Weighted Weighted Floating Fixed average Floating Fixed average interest rate rate rate interest rate rate rate Group m m % m m % Financial assets: Financial assets relating to PFI contracts 176.1 5.8 164.8 5.6 Cash and cash equivalents 22.6 0.2 15.0 Short term deposits 28.7 0.5 12.0 0.8 Financial liabilities: Bank overdrafts and short term loans 2.4 3.1 6.7 2.5 Senior notes 32.0 6.9 47.8 6.9 Bank loans 323.5 2.7 365.8 2.3 Interest rate swaps 307.2 307.2 5.4 119.6 119.6 6.6 Excluded from the analysis above is 13.1m 2009: 15.4m of amounts payable under finance leases as set out in note 21, which are subject to fixed rates of interest.
In addition, trade and other receivables and payables have been excluded as they are not interest bearing.
The average term for short-term deposits is no more than seven days.
For the Company, there were 11.9m short term deposits 2009: nil at an effective interest rate of 0.4%.
The effective interest rate on the Companys cash and cash equivalents was nil% 2009: nil.
The weighted average effective interest rates relating to the Company were nil% 2009: nil for Euro bank overdrafts and 4.2% 2009: 1.96% for bank loans.
In 2009 the company had senior notes at an interest rate of 6.9%.
Interest on inter-company loan balances are charged at rates of between 0% and 12% 2009: 0% and 12%.

The expiry dates of the contracts range from 9 July 2011 earliest to 30 September 2032 latest.

Foreign exchange risk The Group operates in Europe and Canada and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for movements between the Euro, Canadian dollar and Sterling.
The majority of the Groups subsidiaries conduct their business in their respective functional currencies: therefore there is limited transaction risk.
Foreign exchange risk arises mainly from net investments in foreign operations.
This exposure is reduced by funding the investments as far as possible with borrowings in the same currency.
The Group applies hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings.
The Group has designated the carrying value of Euro borrowings of 62.4m 2009: 122.0m fair value of 62.4m 2009: 122.2m as a net investment hedge of the Groups investments denominated in Euros.
The hedge was 100% effective 2009: 100% for the year ended 31 March 2010 and as a result the related exchange gain of 4.8m 2009: loss 17.3m on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in the exchange reserve.
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity assuming all other variables remain constant : The following table details how the Groups income and equity would increase if there were a 10% increase in the respective currency against Sterling.
A 10% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.

As well as term borrowing under a syndicated loan facility, the Group maintains uncommitted lending facilities with a range of banks for working capital purposes.
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows to ensure that facility draw-downs are arranged as necessary and an adequate level of headroom is maintained.
The Groups exposure to, and the way it manages liquidity risk has not changed from the previous year.

Each PFI company has loan facilities which are secured by fixed and floating charges on the future cash flows of PFI contracts.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
Surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with banks and money market funds in accordance with a policy that specifies the minimum acceptable credit rating and the maximum exposure to each counterparty.
At 31 March 2010 the amount of credit risk totalled 51.3m 2009: 27.0m.
Credit risk on derivatives where the fair value is positive is closely monitored to ensure that it remains within the limits set for each counterparty.
At 31 March 2010 the credit risk was nil 2009: nil.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts due from customers for services performed.
Management consider that the exposure to any single customer is not significant and that where credit quality is in doubt, adequate provision has been made for probable losses.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The financial assets relating to PFI contracts are recoverable from the future revenues relating to the PFI contracts.
Management consider that as the counterparties for the future revenues are uK local authorities or councils, there is minimal credit risk.
Capital risk management The Group maintains a group funding strategy to ensure that the Group maintains an appropriate debt to equity ratio as well as an appropriate debt maturity profile.
The strategy is based on the requirements of the Companys Articles of Association, which state that debt should be limited to three times the level of capital and reserves.
The Groups funding strategy has not changed from the previous year.
The Group has to comply with a number of banking covenants which are set out in the agreements for bank loans and senior notes.
There are financial covenants which are measured using the performance of the Core Group, excluding PFI companies, and relate to interest cover, the ratio of debt to EBITdA and the net worth of the Group.
There are other restrictions in the loan documentation concerning acquisitions, disposals, security and other issues.
The Group has complied with its banking covenants.
