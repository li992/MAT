FInAnCIAL PoLICIes For rIsk mAnAGement And tHeIr oBJeCtIves Credit and concentration of risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks, expired goods and without recourse discounts.
A provision for impairment is made where there is an identified lossevent which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
In line with local market practice, clients in the MENA region are offered relatively longer payment terms compared to clients in Europe and theUS.
During the year ended 31 December 2010, the Groups largest three clients in the MENA region represented 18.2% of Group revenue, 13.6% in Saudi Arabia, 2.6% in Tunisia, and 2% in Algeria.
The Group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies and procedures and certaincredit insurance agreements.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise.
Credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for thecustomer, based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the credit worthiness of a particular customer.
The Group is exposedto a variety of customers ranging from government backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and theunderlying local economic risks vary across the Group.
Typical credit terms in the US range from 3060 days, in Europe 30120 days, and MENA180360 days.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of creditand insurance.
market risk The Groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flow associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Management actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the returns toshareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
TheCapital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes theborrowings disclosed in Note 27.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
FInAnCIAL PoLICIes For rIsk mAnAGement And tHeIr oBJeCtIves Continued Foreign exchange risk The Group uses the USD as its functional currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in the Euro, Algerian Dinar, Sudanese Pound and Egyptian Pound.
Consequently, where possible the Group enters into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to hedge against the risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
Due to the lack of open currency markets, Algerian Dinars and Sudanese Pounds cannot be hedged.
Where possible the Group uses financing facilities denominated in local currencies to mitigate the risks.
The Jordanian Dinar and Saudi Riyal have no impact onthe statement of comprehensive income as those currencies are pegged against the US Dollar.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by changing the proportion of debt that is fixed by entering into interest rate swap agreements.
Using these derivative financial instruments has not had a material impact on the Groups financial position at 31 December 2010 orthe Groups results of operations for the year then ended.
As at 31 december 2010 As at 31 december 2009 Fixed rate Floating rate total Fixed rate Floating rate total $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 Financial liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 48,152 119,272 167,424 40,444 144,493 184,937 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 62,718 62,718 65,663 65,663 An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31December 2010, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of the Groups debt portfolio as at 31 December 2010, a 1% increase decrease in interest rates would result in an additional USD 1.2 million 2009: USD 1.4 million in interest expense income being incurred per year.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value: cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount: short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments: long-term loans approximates to the carrying amount in the case of floating rate bank loans and other loans: forward exchange contracts based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date: receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount: and lease obligations approximates to the carrying value.
Management considers that the book value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities does not materially differ from their fair value.
