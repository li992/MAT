Risk Management policies and procedures continued iv Market price risk Market price risk i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the investments.
The Groups investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future prices of investments.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the Investment Managers compliance with the Groups objective, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Group manages its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on indices and on equity or commodity investments in its portfolio.
The Groups exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December 2010 on its quoted and unquoted equity or commodity investments and options on indices and investments was 1,758,274,000 2009: 1,221,734,000.
Concentration of exposure to market price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on pages 13 to 15.
At 31 December 2010, this shows that the portfolio had significant levels of investments in Latin America, Australia and South Africa.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those countries, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Market price risk sensitivity The following illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity to an increase or decrease of 20% in the fair values of the Groups equities including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in 2010.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities and equity exposure through options at each financial reporting date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact of a 20% increase in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 December 2010 is a decrease of 4,572,000 2009: 3,177,000 and on the capital return is an increase of 351,655,000 2009: 244,347,000.
