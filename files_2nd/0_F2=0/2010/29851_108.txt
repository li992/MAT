Active investment working for you Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 25 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Currency risk The income and capital value of the Groups investments and liabilities can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Groups assets and income are denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling which is the Groups reporting currency.
The key areas where foreign currency risk could have an impact on the Group are: movements in rates affect the value of investments and liabilities: movements in rates affect the income received: and movements in rates affect short-term timing differences.
The Group had the following currency exposures as at 31 December 2010, all of which are included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value based on the exchange rates ruling at the year-end.

The Groups cash balance of 1,974,000 2009: 8,899,000 earns interest, calculated on a tiered basis, depending on the balance held, by reference to the base rate.
If the bank base rate had increased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a positive 9,870 2009: 44,495.
If the bank base rate had decreased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a negative 9,870 2009: negative 44,495.
