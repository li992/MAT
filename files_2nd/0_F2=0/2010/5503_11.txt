2 Proven and Probable Reserves and Contingent Resources have been assessed by the Groups internal reservoir engineers, utilising geological, geophysical, engineering and financial data.
3 The Groups Proven and Probable Reserves have been audited by a recognised Competent Person in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set out under the 2007 Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
4 Contingent Resources relate to technically recoverable hydrocarbons for which commerciality has not yet been determined and are stated on a most likely technical case or 2C basis.
5 Attributable to partial decommissioning of the Sullom Voe Terminal SVT LPG processing plant during the year, resulting in Heather, Broom and Thistle light ends components delivered to the terminal being reclassified, with the propane no longer forming part of the saleable production revenue stream.
Some of this propane value is now recovered by a reduced contribution to terminal fuel and flare costs.
6 Attributable to the change from offshore loading to direct export via SVT during the year.
As described in note 5, following partial decommissioning of the SVT LPG processing plant in 2010, propane and butane volumes do not form part of the saleable production revenue stream.
Instead, the surplus light ends recovered offshore will contribute to increased SVT oil production and terminal fuel and flare costs.
7 All volumes are presented pre SVT value adjustment.
8 The values presented include some licences offered to the Group in October 2010 which had not legally commenced as at 31 December 2010.
9 On 10 December 2010, the Group assigned 30% of its equity in the Elke P995, Block 28 3a licence to KUFPEC under a Sale and Purchase Agreement.
10 On 11 February 2011 the Group sold its 48.75% interest in the Slovenian Petisovci project.
The Group had acquired its interest in Petisovci through its acquisition of Stratic in November 2010 and Contingent Resources of 12.47 MMboe related to this asset were therefore excluded from the Groups Contingent Resources at 31 December 2010. our active capital programme allowed enQuests 2P reserves to increase by 10% to a net 88.5 mmboe, representing a reserve replacement ratio of 208% in our maiden year of operations.
