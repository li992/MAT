Cash and Borrowings continued Liquidity RiskExposures The Board has established a set of policies to manage funding and currency risks.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Groups policy is to ensure that there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short and mediumterm cash forecasts having regard to the maturities of investments and borrowingfacilities.
Bank loans and overdrafts represent drawings under total committed facilities of $1,511m 2009 $2,503m and total uncommitted facilities of $332m 2009 $415m.
The Group has undrawn committed facilities of $884m 2009 $1,436m.
Of the undrawn committed facilities, $7m expires within one year and $877m after two but within five years 2009 $1m expired within one year and $1,435m after two but within five years.
The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is at floating rate and is typically based on the LIBOR interest rate relevant to the term and currency concerned.
Borrowings are shown at book value which is the same as fairvalue.
In December 2010 the Company reviewed and replaced its principal banking facilities ahead of their maturity in May 2012.
The Company has reduced its $1 billion 5-year term facility to $500 million with effect from 20 December 2010.
The interest rate for this multi-currency facility, at 20 basis points over LIBOR, is unchanged.
Smith & Nephew has also cancelled its $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving facility and replaced it with a new 5-year $1 billion multi-currency revolving facility with an initial interest rate of 70 basis points over LIBOR.
The commitment fee on the undrawn amount of the revolving facility is 24.5 basis points.
The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under the facility agreement requiring the Groups ratio of net debt to EBITDA to not exceed 3.0 to 1 and the ratio of EBITA to net interest to not be less than 3.0 to 1, with net debt, EBITDA, EBITA and net interest all being calculated as defined in the agreement.
These financial covenants are tested at the end of each half year for the 12 months ending on the last day of the testing period.
As of 31 December 2010, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
The facility is also subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.
