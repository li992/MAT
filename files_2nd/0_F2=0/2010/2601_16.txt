NOTES 1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 have been approved by the directors and prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as referred to in the Directors report on page 25 and under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations was revised with effect from 1 January 2010, the principal effect of which for the Group has been to change the accounting treatment of certain acquisition related costs.
IFRS 3 now requires that transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are expensed and charged to the income statement and that adjustments to deferred consideration and payments which are contingent on the continued employment of former owners of businesses acquired are also recognised in the income statement.
Prior to 1 January 2010 these items were treated as part of the cost of investment and, as a result, were capitalised with any subsequent changes being accounted for as an adjustment to goodwill.
In accordance with the revised requirements of IFRS 3, the comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2009 have not been restated.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
2 Accounting policies a Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion, deferred consideration and payments which are contingent on the continued employment of former owners of businesses acquired.
The excess of the consideration excluding payments contingent on future employment over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
IFRS 3 revised requires that any payments that are contingent on future employment and transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
ii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the income and expenses of associates.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, unless they qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting treatment, in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates.
All resulting exchange differences, including exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
c Financial instruments Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, financial instruments are initially measured at fair value with subsequent measurement depending upon the classification of the instrument.
Other financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost unless they are in a fair value hedging relationship.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
i Fair value hedge Where a derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a recognised asset or liability, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged with changes recognised in the income statement.
46 Notes Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 2 Accounting policies continued ii Cash flow hedge Where a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a hedge is used to hedge forecast transactions, any effective portion of the change in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
iii Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective such differences are recognised in the income statement.
d Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
e Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated residual value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives.
This is applied at the following annual rates: Buildings 2% or depreciated over life of lease if shorter than 50 years Plant and machinery 10 20% Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10 33% Freehold land Not depreciated The assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
f Intangible assets i Goodwill Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations from 1 January 2004 and has elected not to restate previous business combinations.
For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount previously recorded under UK GAAP.
For acquisitions that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For acquisitions that have occurred on or after 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination excluding payments contingent on future employment and acquisition related costs in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised on acquisition and recorded at fair value.
These principally relate to customer relationships and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
g Leases Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings due to the indefinite life of land.
h Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amounts are estimated.
The recoverable amounts of assets carried at amortised cost are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
Receivables with a short term duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amounts of other assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs to sell and the value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, with impairment losses being recognised in the income statement.
i Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, bank overdrafts and short term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date the deposit is made.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 Notes 47 NOTES continued 2 Accounting policies continued k Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less any impairment losses.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables or uncertainty as to whether the Group will be able to collect all such amounts.
l Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Payables with a short term duration are not discounted.
m Income tax Income tax in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items reflected in equity when it is recognised in equity.
Current tax reflects tax payable on taxable income for the year using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method providing for temporary differences arising between tax bases and carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the forseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which any asset can be utilised.
n Revenue The Group is engaged in the delivery of goods to customers.
Revenue from a sale is recognised in the income statement upon delivery of the relevant goods, which is the point in time at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred.
Revenue is valued at invoiced amount, excluding sales taxes, less estimated provisions for returns and trade discounts where relevant.
Revenue is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due.
o Employee benefits i Defined contribution pension schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense to the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit pension schemes Pension liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and represent the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities.
Scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted using the rate applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities.
Current service cost, past service cost credit and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments are credited or charged to the income statement.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent benefits are already vested or is otherwise amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits are vested.
The unwinding of the discount on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance cost and the expected return on scheme assets generated during the year is included within finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
p Investment in own shares The cost of shares held either directly treasury shares or indirectly employee benefit trust shares is deducted from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised in retained earnings.
48 Notes Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 2 Accounting policies continued q Share based payments The Group operates equity settled and cash settled share based compensation plans.
Details of these plans are outlined in Note 16 and the Directors remuneration report.
As permitted by IFRS 1, on transition to IFRS the Group elected not to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002.
For equity settled plans the total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the grant date calculated using a valuation model and is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity.
For cash settled plans the total expected expense is based on the fair value of options, determined at the appropriate balance sheet date, and is remeasured at each balance sheet date thereafter with a corresponding credit recognised as a liability.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to not achieving the non-market conditions for vesting.
On 25 August 2010 the Group converted its cash settled share options to equity settled share options.
r Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the Groups obligations under the contract.
s Net debt Net debt is defined as interest bearing loans and borrowings and the fair value of interest rate swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.
t Dividends The interim dividend is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the level of judgement and estimation required which often involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is anticipated.
The directors review the judgements and estimates on an ongoing basis with revisions to accounting estimates recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The directors believe that the consolidated financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of the Groups performance and financial position.
a Pension benefits The cost of defined benefit pension schemes and the present value of the obligations relating thereto are determined using actuarial valuations appropriate for each country where defined benefit pension schemes are provided.
The actuarial valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, future pension increases and mortality rates.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
In determining the appropriate discount rates, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds with an AA rating in the relevant country.
Future salary increases and future pension increases are based on expected future inflation rates for each country.
Mortality rates are based on the relevant mortality tables for each country.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in Note 20. b Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates, timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in Note 9. c Revenue recognition Revenue represents sales to third parties for goods sold and is valued at invoiced amount, excluding sales taxes, less estimated provisions for returns and trade discounts where relevant.
Returns provisions are based on experience over an appropriate period whereas volume and early settlement discounts are based on agreements with customers.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 Notes 49 NOTES continued 2 Accounting policies continued d Acquisitions Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method based on the fair value of the consideration paid.
Assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and the purchase price is allocated to assets and liabilities based on these fair values.
Determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including discount rates, asset lives and recoverability.
Assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and the value of freehold properties is typically determined by qualified valuers on an open market basis.
Management believes that estimates made in previous years have been materially accurate as any changes made in the allocation period following acquisition to finalise provisional fair value adjustments made in the year of acquisition have not been material.
e Tax The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions.
Management is required to make judgements and estimates in determining the provisions for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Tax benefits are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future against which temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised.
New accounting standards and interpretations The Group does not consider that any other standards or interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB but not yet applicable will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The Group is managed through four business areas based on geographic regions which represent the reporting segments under IFRS 8.
The revenue presented relates to external customers.
Sales between the business areas are not material.
Each of the business areas supplies a range of products to customers operating primarily in the foodservice, grocery, cleaning & safety, non-food retail and healthcare market sectors.
The performance of the four business areas is assessed by reference to operating profit before intangible amortisation and acquisition related costs and this measure also represents the segment results for the purposes of reporting in accordance with IFRS 8.
Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the business areas.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8, the Companys chief operating decision maker is the Board of Directors.
There are no customers who account for more than 10% of Group revenue.
Customer dependencies are regularly monitored.

The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves the level and type of non-audit work which the auditor performs, including the fees paid for such work, to ensure that the auditors objectivity and independence are not compromised.

The expected tax rate is calculated as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
The adjustments to the tax charge at the weighted average rate to determine the income tax on profit are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Profit before income tax 225.2 216.0 Tax charge at weighted average rate 2010: 34.0%: 2009: 35.1% 76.5 75.8 Effects of: adjustment in respect of prior years 8.8 10.3 non-taxable non-deductible items 2.0 1.2 other 0.5 0.4 Income tax on profit 66.2 67.1 2010 2009 Deferred tax in the income statement m m Accelerated capital allowances 0.2 0.9 Pension liabilities 3.0 1.8 Intangible assets 13.4 11.6 Share based payments 0.2 0.1 Provisions 0.7 7.4 Other 11.5 1.7 Deferred tax on profit 1.8 19.9 7 Earnings per share 2010 2009 m m Profit for the year 159.0 148.9 Adjustment 37.1 30.2 Adjusted profit 196.1 179.1 Basic weighted average ordinary shares in issue million 323.7 320.5 Dilutive effect of employee share plans million 2.2 0.9 Diluted weighted average ordinary shares million 325.9 321.4 Basic earnings per share 49.1p 46.4p Adjustment 11.5p 9.5p Adjusted earnings per share 60.6p 55.9p Diluted basic earnings per share 48.8p 46.3p Adjustment 11.4p 9.4p Adjusted diluted earnings per share 60.2p 55.7p Adjusted profit, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the charge for intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and the respective associated tax.
The intangible amortisation and associated tax are non-cash charges which are not taken into account by management when assessing the underlying performance of the business.
Similarly, the acquisition related costs and associated tax do not relate to the underlying performance of the entity acquired as they are a non-operational expense.
Accordingly, such charges are removed in calculating the adjusted earnings per share on which management assesses the performance of the Group.

Customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
Impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units CGUs.
A description of the Groups principal activities is set out in the Directors report on page 24.
There is no significant difference in the nature of activities across different geographies.
The identification of CGUs reflects the way in which the business is managed on a geographical basis.
Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs to sell.
The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period together with a terminal value.
The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are predicted.
The Groups methodology is to use a projection period of five years being the maximum period over which detailed future cash flows for each CGU are prepared.
For periods after this five year period, the methodology applies a long term growth rate to derive a terminal value.
Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating activities of the CGU and reflect managements expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period.
The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, achievability of future margins, any significant changes to the customer base and the discount rate used in the present value calculation.
The information used for valuation purposes takes into consideration past experience and the current economic environment with regard to customer attrition rates and additions to the customer base, the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying cost base.
This provides a long term growth rate consistent with the geographic segments in which the Group operates, together with managements assessment of future operating performance and market share movements.
The growth rate has been calculated based principally on current inflation rates of the relevant economies.
At 31 December 2010 North America, UK Hospitality and France Hygiene carried a significant amount of goodwill in comparison with the total value of the Groups goodwill.
The carrying value of goodwill in respect of North America at 31 December 2010 was 186.7m 2009: 176.6m.
The carrying value of goodwill in respect of UK Hospitality at 31 December 2010 was 104.9m 2009: 104.9m.
The carrying value of goodwill in respect of France Hygiene at 31 December 2010 was 84.3m 2009: 84.2m.
At 31 December 2010 the aggregate amount of goodwill attributable to the Groups CGUs, excluding North America, UK Hospitality and France Hygiene, was 413.1m 2009: 383.7m.
For North America, UK Hospitality and France Hygiene the weighted average growth rate used in 2010 was 2.5% 2009: 2.5%.
A discount rate of 8% 2009: 8% has been applied to the value in use calculations representing a pre-tax rate reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet date.
Similar assumptions have been applied to the other CGUs but where appropriate the directors have considered alternative market risk assumptions to reflect the specific conditions arising in individual countries with discount rates ranging from 8%16%.
56 Notes Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 9 Intangible assets continued Management has also considered the key assumptions that impact future cash flows.
The key assumption on which value in use calculations are dependent relates to the underlying customer base.
In particular the assumptions are sensitive to customer attrition and the rate at which new customer relationships are introduced and established.
Based on past experience and taking into account current market conditions, management considers that it is unlikely that a change in key assumptions would result in impairment as it is reasonable to assume that there will be no material deterioration in the customer base over the projection period which will significantly impact future cash flows.
Should such a change occur, this would represent a triggering event to indicate that an impairment review may be necessary.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review would then be undertaken on the relevant assets within the CGU.
Any such changes are monitored through normal monthly procedures.

The Group monitors the return on average operating capital employed as well as the level of total shareholders equity and the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, the return on average operating capital employed was 54.4% 2009: 54.7%, the level of total shareholders equity at 31 December 2010 was 796.4m 2009: 674.1m and the amount of dividends paid in the year ended 31 December 2010 was 66.1m 2009: 62.3m.
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders equity and bank and capital market borrowings.
All of the borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
The overall objective is to manage the funding to ensure the Group has a portfolio of competitively priced borrowing facilities to meet the demands of the business over time and, in order to do so, the Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources with a variety of maturity dates.
The Groups businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation which helps fund future development and growth.
The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the executive directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place.
Hedge accounting The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: b a hedge of the cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates: or c a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
The accounting treatment for hedges is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy in Note 2.
The Group tests the effectiveness of hedges on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms and regression analysis.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, arranges borrowings from a variety of sources.
Additionally, compliance with debt covenants is monitored.
During 2010 all covenants have been complied with.
The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available to it comprising multi-currency credit facilities from the Groups banks and US dollar and sterling bonds.
At 31 December 2010, the total bonds outstanding were 562.3m 2009: 532.7m with maturities ranging from 2011 to 2019.
In addition a further issue of fixed interest rate US dollar and sterling bonds was agreed in December 2010 for a total value of 95.2m of which 75.2m is due to be drawn by the Company in April 2011 and is included in the contractual cash flow table in this Note 13 as an inflow within one year and as an outflow after more than five years.
The bank facilities mature between 2011 and 2015.
At 31 December 2010 the available bank facilities totalled 781.5m of which 224.2m was drawn down.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Expiring within one year 139.0 160.0 Expiring after one year but within two years 140.0 134.7 Expiring after two years 278.3 246.4 557.3 541.1 In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.
The contractual maturity profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December is set out below.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest cash flows forecast using LIBOR interest rates at 31 December in the case of floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
Derivative assets and liabilities totalling 23.5m 2009: 25.2m have been included within the tables since they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Groups debt.
Bank loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities.
Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.
At 31 December 2010 loans totalling 5.4m were secured by fixed charges on property 2009: nil as a result of an acquisition made during the year.

Level two fair value measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The US dollar bonds, included within financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value, have a carrying amount of 214.9m 2009: 210.6m which includes a fair value measurement related to the risk being hedged.
The table above also discloses the fair value of these bonds including all other components of 210.7m 2009: 204.9m.
Fair value gains and losses on interest rate caps and the time value of interest rate collars impact the income statement immediately while all other financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value are in hedging relationships.
Interest rate risk The Group is funded by a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt.
In addition, interest rate swaps and interest rate options are used to manage the interest rate risk profile.
At 31 December 2010 fixed rate debt of 347.4m 2009: 322.1m related to fixed US dollar and sterling bonds stated at amortised cost with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2019.
At 31 December 2010 floating rate debt comprised 245.6m of floating rate bank loans 2009: 251.3m and 214.9m of fixed rate US dollar bonds which have been swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps 2009: 210.6m.
Bank loans are drawn for various periods of up to three months at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps reprice every three and six months.
These interest rate swaps are in fair value hedge relationships with the market risk of the US dollar bonds.
These hedges were effective during the year and have therefore had no net impact on the income statement.
The interest rate risk on the floating rate debt is managed using interest rate options.
Borrowings with a notional principal of 301.0m were capped at 31 December 2010 2009: 309.7m and borrowings with a notional principal of nil were collared at 31 December 2010 2009: 186.3m.
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to the intrinsic value of interest rate collars.
Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps or to the time value of the interest rate collars.
The strike rates of these options are based on sterling, US dollar and euro LIBOR repricing every three months.
After taking account of hedge relationships, a change of 1% in the interest rate forward curves on 31 December would have increased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below as a result of changes in the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at that date: Impact on profit before tax Impact on equity 1% 1% 1% 1% m m m m 2010 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.2 2009 1.0 0.3 1.0 0.3 Foreign currency risk The principal underlying currencies of the Groups earnings are sterling, US dollars and euros.
The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on translation of earnings into sterling at average exchange rates.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2010 2009 2010 2009 US dollar 1.55 1.57 1.57 1.61 Euro 1.17 1.12 1.17 1.13 For the year ended 31 December 2010, a movement of one cent in the US dollar and euro average exchange rates would have changed profit before tax by 0.8m and 0.3m respectively and profit before tax, intangible amortisation and acquisition related costs by 0.8m and 0.5m respectively.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are usually relatively limited.
Where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge significant exposures of firm commitments for a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as cash flow hedges.
However, the economic impact of foreign exchange on the value of uncommitted future purchases and sales is not hedged.
As a result, sudden and significant movements in foreign exchange rates can impact profit margins where there is a delay in passing on to customers the resulting price increases.
For the year ended 31 December 2010 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a 0.6m loss recognised in equity 2009: gain of 0.8m which will affect the income statement during 2011.
The majority of the Groups borrowings are effectively denominated in sterling, US dollars and euros, aligning them to the respective functional currencies of its operating profit before depreciation, intangible amortisation and acquisition related costs EBITDA.
This currency profile is achieved using short term foreign exchange contracts, long term cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency debt.
This currency composition minimises the impact of foreign exchange rates on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Cross currency interest rate swaps in a cash flow hedge relationship were effective during the year, with a loss of 1.2m 2009: 2.6m being recognised in equity which will affect the income statement from 2011 to 2015.
60 Notes Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 13 Risk management and financial instruments continued The currency profile of the Groups net debt as at 31 December is set out in the table below: 2010 2009 m m Sterling 209.9 220.0 US dollar 350.3 307.7 Euro 140.8 167.4 Other 15.8 21.7 716.8 716.8 If a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling had taken place on 31 December it would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below.
The impact of this translation is much greater on equity than it is on profit before tax since equity is translated using the closing exchange rates and profit before tax is translated using the average exchange rates for the year.
As a result the value of equity is more sensitive than the value of profit before tax to a movement in exchange rates on 31 December and the resulting movement in profit before tax is due solely to the translation effect on monetary items.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, and in particular interest rates, remain constant.

The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to counterparty default by restricting the type of counterparty it deals with and by employing an appropriate policy in relation to the collection of financial assets.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash and deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash and deposits Note 23, derivative financial instruments see above and trade and other receivables Note 11 is their carrying amount.
Dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and suitable credit rating.
The Group continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure to each counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, the amounts represented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Note 11 sets out an analysis of trade and other receivables and the provision for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.

It expects that these amounts, which are based on detailed plans or other known factors and take account of past experience for similar items, will be settled within the next one to five years.
The Group is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations.
While any litigation has an element of uncertainty, management does not expect that the outcome of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations.

The Company is able to control the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, therefore, the timing of the remittance of the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
In general, the Company has determined either that such earnings will not be distributed in the foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit those earnings, no tax liability is expected to arise.
Deferred tax of 1.4m has been recognised in the exceptional case where distribution of earnings is both planned and expected to result in a tax liability.
Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be realised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised tax losses of 7.0m 2009: 10.6m.
The unutilised tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 95.9m 2009: 96.1m as it is not considered probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be utilised.

Further details of the share plans operated by the Company are set out in the Directors remuneration report.
Sharesave Scheme 2001 Sharesave Scheme The Sharesave Scheme, approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting, is approved by HM Revenue & Customs in the UK and is open to all UK employees, including the UK based executive directors, who have completed at least three months of continuous service.
It is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to 250 per month over a period of either three or five years.
Under the Sharesave Scheme options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing on the day immediately preceding the date of invitation to apply for the option.
Options are normally exercisable either three or five years after they have been granted.
The Sharesave Scheme is due to expire in May 2011.
The Company intends to seek shareholder approval for a replacement Scheme at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in April 2011. International Sharesave Plan The International Sharesave Plan was introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme by shareholders.
It operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme save that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of approximately 250 per month or equivalent in other currencies over a period of three years and options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing shortly before the date of invitation to apply for the option.
The International Sharesave Plan is due to expire in May 2011.
If the new Sharesave Scheme is approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting, the Company intends to introduce a replacement Plan which will operate on a similar basis to the existing International Sharesave Plan.
Irish Sharesave Plan The Irish Sharesave Plan was also introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme by shareholders.
It is approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of the euro equivalent of approximately 250 per month over a period of three years and options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing shortly before the date of invitation to apply for the option.
The Irish Sharesave Plan is due to expire in May 2011.
If the new Sharesave Scheme is approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting, the Company intends to introduce a replacement Plan which will operate on a similar basis to the existing Irish Sharesave Plan.
1994 Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 Scheme The 1994 Scheme was approved by shareholders at the 1994 Annual General Meeting.
No further options have been granted under the 1994 Scheme since it expired in May 2004.
A performance condition, based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years, had to be satisfied before options would normally be exercisable.
All such performance conditions relating to options granted under the 1994 Scheme have been satisified.
Prior to 25 August 2010 all options granted under the 1994 Scheme to US resident participants with the exception of Mr P L Larmon were settled in cash rather than through the delivery of shares based upon the market value of the Companys ordinary shares at the time the relevant options were exercised.
With effect from such date, all such cash settled options were converted to equity settled options.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and replaced the 1994 Scheme.
The LTIP is divided into two parts.
Part A allows the Board to grant share options.
In normal circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Share options granted to date have a performance condition attached based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years.
Prior to 25 August 2010 all options granted under Part A of the LTIP to US resident participants with the exception of Mr P L Larmon were settled in cash rather than through the delivery of shares based upon the market value of the Companys ordinary shares at the time the relevant options were exercised.
Part B of the LTIP allows the Board to award performance shares which is a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
A performance share award will normally vest i. e. become exercisable on the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied.
The extent to which performance share awards granted prior to 2007 vested was subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period relative to the TSR performance of a specified peer group of companies.
The extent to which performance share awards granted thereafter have vested or will in future vest is normally partly subject to the Companys TSR performance and partly subject to the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 Notes 63 NOTES continued 16 Share capital and share based payments continued Investment in own shares The Company holds a number of its ordinary shares in an employee benefit trust.
The principal purpose of this trust is to hold shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to certain senior employees and executive directors relating to options granted and awards made in respect of market purchase shares under the 1994 Scheme, the LTIP and the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme DASBS.
Details of such plans are set out above and in the Directors remuneration report.
The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been incorporated in the consolidated financial statements.
Finance costs and administration charges are included in the income statement on an accruals basis.
At 31 December 2010 the trust held 3,995,293 2009: 6,502,865 shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal value of 1.3m 2009: 2.1m and market value of 28.7m 2009: 43.9m.
IFRS 2 disclosures Options granted during the year have been valued using a stochastic model.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2010 2009 Grant date 25.02.201008.10.10 26.02.0902.10.09 Share price at grant date 6.697.61 4.926.52 Exercise price nil7.57 nil5.86 Options granted during the year shares 4,273,366 4,702,399 Vesting period years 35 35 Expected volatility % 2125 2125 Option life years 310 310 Expected life years 3.06.5 3.06.4 Risk free rate of return % 0.93.1 1.83.0 Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield % 2.83.2 3.24.2 Fair value per option 0.592.78 0.372.21 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three to five years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The weighted average share price for options exercised by employees of the Company and its subsidiaries during the year was 7.42 2009: 5.99.
The total charge for the year relating to share based payments was 4.1m 2009: 6.0m, comprising a charge of 3.4m relating to equity settled options 2009: 3.2m and a charge of 0.7m relating to cash settled options 2009: 2.8m.
After tax the total charge was 2.0m 2009: 4.7m.
On 25 August 2010 the cash settled options were converted to equity settled options thereby harmonising all of the relevant option plans.
The outstanding liability in relation to the cash settled options of 4.3m at that date 31 December 2009: 5.3m was transferred to equity.

Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 Notes 65 N NO OTE TES S c con onti tin nu ue ed d 20 Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The funds of the principal schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the UK defined benefit schemes in April 2009 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The valuation of the UK defined benefit schemes has been updated to 31 December 2010 by the Groups actuaries.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice and local conditions and practices.
Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 are stated at their bid value.
The amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group were as follows: 2010 2009 Amounts included in net operating expenses m m Defined contribution schemes 9.5 8.5 Defined benefit schemes current service cost 5.4 4.8 past service cost 0.1 0.1 Total operating charge 15.0 13.4 Amounts included in finance income cost Expected return on scheme assets 16.8 14.7 Interest charge on scheme liabilities 16.3 15.2 Net financial return charge 0.5 0.5 Total charge 14.5 13.9 2010 2009 Amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 10.8 9.2 Experience gain on scheme liabilities 1.2 1.2 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 14.5 29.7 Actuarial loss on pension schemes 2.5 19.3 Movement in pension schemes minimum funding liabilities 5.5 2.5 13.8 The cumulative amount of actuarial losses arising since 1 January 2004 recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 31 December 2010 was 67.4m 2009: 64.9m.
66 Notes Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 20 Pensions continued The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 were: Europe 2010 2009 Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years 21.0 20.7 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years 22.9 21.8 US Longevity at age 65 for current and future pensioners years 19.7 19.5 Europe US 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% 4.3% 3.8% 3.0% 3.0% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions 3.4% 3.3% 2.8% Discount rate 5.4% 5.7% 6.4% 5.7% 6.1% 6.3% Inflation rate 2.8% 3.3% 2.8% 2.5% 2.5% 3.0% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

M. Supply, Cool-Pak and Vant Veer Verpakkingen.
Clean Care, a business principally engaged in the supply of cleaning and hygiene consumable products in Denmark, was acquired on 15 January 2010.
Hamo, a distributor of catering disposables and light catering equipment to customers in both the public and private sectors, was acquired on 12 February 2010.
Weita, a supplier of cleaning and hygiene, foodservice, retail, healthcare and safety consumables products to both end users and redistributors in Switzerland, was acquired on 12 March 2010.
Silco, a supplier of foodservice disposables in Israel, was acquired on 21 April 2010.
Juba, a supplier of personal protection equipment to redistributors throughout Spain, was acquired on 27 May 2010.
Global Net, which sells cleaning and hygiene consumables and equipment to contract cleaners, local authorities and other industrial customers throughout the Walloon region of Belgium, was acquired on 1 July 2010.
A. M. Supply, which supplies personal protection equipment to the oil and petrochemical sector in the state of Rio fide Janeiro in Brazil, was acquired on 26 August 2010.
Cool-Pak, a leading distributor of plastic and pulp packaging to fruit and vegetable growers in the US, was acquired on 30 August 2010.
Vant Veer Verpakkingen, a business supplying cleaning and hygiene and catering disposable products in the Netherlands predominantly to the healthcare sector, was acquired on 1 October 2010.
Acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, involving the purchase of 100% of the acquirees share capital or, as the case may be, all of the relevant assets of the businesses acquired.
Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through acquisition.
The Group has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
This formal process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate.
Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant acquisition date.
As at 31 December 2010, the allocation period for all acquisitions completed since 1 January 2010 remained open and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.
Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the acquisition date.
To date the adjustments made have impacted assets acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value.
Similarly adjustments have been made to acquired liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
The net impact from these adjustments on acquired net assets reported in the Groups 2010 statutory accounts was nil.
IFRS 3 requires that any such payments that are contingent on future employment are charged to the income statement.
All other consideration has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill.
Transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Groups activities and create enhanced returns.
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.
