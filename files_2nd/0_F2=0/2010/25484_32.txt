Reclassifications of financial instruments During the prior year the group reclassified certain financial instruments out of fair value through profit and loss.
These assets were originally classified as held for trading but the groups intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group reclassified 112.3 million and 7.8 million to the loans and receivables and available for sale classifications, respectively.
The amount reclassified reflected the fair value of the financial assets at the date of reclassification.
At the time of the transfers, the group identified the rare circumstances permitting such reclassifications, being severe liquidity in the relevant markets.
The group did not undertake any further reclassifications under the amendment to IAS 39 in the current year.
The following table shows carrying values and fair values of the assets reclassified: Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value as at as at as at as at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 000 2010 2010 2009 2009 Trading assets reclassified to loans and receivables 96 383 86 870 112 402 106 189 Trading assets reclassified to available for sale 7 797 7 797 96 383 86 870 120 199 113 986 If the reclassifications had not been made, the groups income before tax in 2010 would have reduced by 5.1 million 2009: a reduction of 6.2 million.
In the current year the reclassified assets have contributed 2.6 million to net interest income.
In 2009, the reclassified assets resulted in a net interest expense of 0.3 million.
As at the date of reclassification the effective interest rates on reclassified trading assets ranged from 4.61% to 18.29%.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires that an entity disclose for each class of financial instruments measured at fair value the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety.
The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs 7 used in making fair value measurements.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities related to the long-term assurance business attributable to policyholders have been excluded from the analysis as the change in fair value of related assets is attributable to policyholders.

Financial instruments for which fair value approximates carrying value For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity less than three months it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value.
This assumption also applies to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing spreads earned on the transactions with spreads earned on similar new transactions entered into by the group.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows, using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
For quoted sub-debt issued, the fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.
Certain financial instruments, that would normally be carried at fair value, continue to be recognised at transaction price.
This occurs when the fair value would normally be determined using valuation techniques which cannot be relied on due to insufficient external inputs.
This results in gains or losses which have not been recognised on balance sheet.

Derivative financial instruments Derivatives The group enters into various contracts for derivatives both as principal for trading purposes and as customer for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
These include financial futures, options, swaps and forward rate agreements.
The risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored in the same manner as for the underlying instruments.
Risks are also measured across the product range in order to take into account possible correlations.
In the tables that follow notional principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument represents the positive or negative cash flows which would have occurred had the rights and obligations arising from that instrument been closed out by the group in an orderly market transaction at balance sheet date.

Goodwill continued Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if evidence exists that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on expected cash flows within the cash generating units of the group to which the goodwill is allocated.
Key assumptions within the calculation include discount rates, growth rates in revenue and related expenditure.
Discount rates are based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market conditions, adjusted for the specific risks associated with the cash-generating unit.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Cash flow forecasts are based on most recent financial budgets for the next financial year and are extrapolated for a period of 3 to 5 years, adjusted for expected future events.
UK, Europe and Australia The two most significant cash-generating units giving rise to goodwill are Investec Asset Management and Kensington.
For Investec Asset Management, the recoverability of goodwill of 88.0 million has been tested with reference to both the underlying profitability taking into account 2010 profits before taxation of 25.3 million 2009: 17.1 million and budgets and plans for the next three years and the value of the business as represented by funds under management of 21.7 billion 2009: 13.1 billion.
These factors support the carrying value of goodwill.
Goodwill of 121.1 million arising on the acquisition of Kensington on 7 August 2008 was written down by 60.0 million at 31 March 2008 to 61.2 million following the managed reduction in business volumes and limited activity in securitisation markets.
At 31 March 2010, the remaining goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of the existing book, assuming no new mortgage origination and no recovery in securitisation markets.
Cash flows have been projected for a 5 year period using the latest available information on debts and expected repayments discounted at 11%.
On this basis goodwill is above book value.
Future impairment of this goodwill will largely be dependent on the timing of future repayments and the level of future business generated.
South Africa The majority of goodwill attributed to the South African operations relate to Investec Asset Management, particularly to the businesses from the Fedsure acquisition, which have been identified as a separate cash-generating unit.
The goodwill relating to Fedsure has been tested for impairment, taking into account profitability, being the current year profits and the budgeted profits and funds under 7 management.
The discount rate applied of 12.99% is determined using the South African risk-free rate adjusted for the risk related to the cash-generating unit.
An impairment of 3.5 million was recognised in the current year on this goodwill.

Staff Share scheme The group operates a share option and a share purchase scheme for employees.
The number of ordinary shares conditionally allocated to employees are disclosed in note 6.
Movements in the number of share options issued to each option is in respect of one share employees are as follows: For the year to 31 March Outstanding at 1 April 62 289 193 57 222 077 Issued during the year 26 051 330 11 749 731 Exercised 17 745 558 4 283 218 Lapsed 3 562 406 2 399 397 Outstanding at 31 March 67 032 559 62 289 193 The purpose of the Staff Share scheme is to promote an esprit fide corps within the organisation, create an awareness of Investecs 7 performance and provide an incentive to maximise individual and group performance by allowing all staff to share in the risks and rewards of the group.
The group makes awards available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the groups share price.
At present, the practice of the group is to give all permanent staff members a share allocation based on their annual package after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff these share awards vest over periods varying from five to eight years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance and contribution made by the respective staff members.
The extent of the directors and staff interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on page 248.

7 Financial Services Compensation Scheme The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS provides compensation to customers of UK authorised financial institutions in the event that an institution which is a participating member of the FSCS is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises annual levies from participating members to meet its management expenses and compensation costs.
Individual participating members make payments based on their level of participation in the case of deposits, the proportion that their protected deposits represent of total protected deposits at 31 December each year.
If an institution is a participating member on this date it is obligated to pay a levy imposed in the immediately following levy period which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
The FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury to fund the compensation costs associated with Bradford & Bingley, Heritable Bank, Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander, Landsbanki Icesave and London Scottish Bank plc.
These borrowings are on an interest-only basis until September 2011.
Investec Bank plc is a participating member of the FSCS and the bank has accrued 2 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS, including the interest on the loan from HM Treasury, in respect of the two levy years to 31 March 2011.
The accrual is based on estimates for the interest the FSCS will pay on the loan and estimates of the level of the banks market participation in the relevant periods.
Interest will continue to accrue to the FSCS on the HM Treasury loan and will form part of future FSCS levies.
If the remaining available assets of the defaulting institutions are insufficient to allow the FSCS to repay the HM Treasury loan when due, the FSCS will agree a schedule of repayments of any remaining principal outstanding with HM Treasury, which will be recouped from the industry in the form of additional levies.
At the date of these financial statements, it is not possible to estimate whether there will ultimately be additional levies on the industry, the level of Investecs market participation or other factors that may affect the amounts or timing of amounts that may ultimately become payable, nor the effect that such levies may have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Legal proceedings Investec operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to litigation risks.
As a result, Investec is involved in disputes and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which Investec is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
These claims, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Post balance sheet events Proposed acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc Rensburg Sheppards On 30 March 2010, the independent Rensburg Sheppards directors and the board of directors of Investec announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all share offer the Offer under which Investec plc will acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Rensburg Sheppards not already owned by it, to be effected by means of a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the Scheme On 6 May 2010 the Financial Services Authority FSA formally approved Investec and any relevant affiliate of Investec which would be deemed to be acquiring control as such term is defined in FSMA as a controller of all and any relevant entities within the Rensburg Sheppards group which are authorised in the UK by the FSA under FSMA.
The requisite approvals to seek the courts approval to sanction the scheme were obtained at the court meeting and general meeting of Rensburg Sheppards shareholders held on 1 June 2010.
Post balance sheet events continued Proposed acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc Rensburg Sheppards continued Completion of the scheme remains subject to the satisfaction or, if permitted, waiver of the remaining conditions of the scheme set out in the scheme document dated 26 April 2010 including, inter alia, the sanction of the scheme and confirmation of the capital reduction by the court.
The court hearing to sanction the scheme is expected to take place on 22 June 2010 and the court hearing to confirm the capital reduction is expected to take place on 24 June 2010.
Background to the offer As a specialist bank and asset manager, Investec has focused on developing a balanced and diversified portfolio of businesses serving the needs of select market niches where it can compete effectively The groups wealth and asset management activities have developed strongly over the past few years and are important and core components of its business model Investec seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between revenue earned from operational risk businesses and revenue earned from financial risk businesses.
This ensures that the group is not over reliant on any one part of its business to sustain its activities and that it has a large recurring revenue base that the directors of Investec believe enable it to better navigate through varying cycles and to support its long-term growth objectives The groups current strategic objectives include increasing the proportion of its non-lending revenue base and moving the organisation onto the front foot thereby capitalising on opportunities within the dislocated financial system Against this background, Investec intends to continue to strengthen and develop its wealth and asset management and private client platforms In its current form Rensburg Sheppards plc came about on 6 May 2005 through the reverse merger of Investecs Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limiteds business with the then Rensburg plc.
Following that merger, Investec retained a major shareholding and currently has approximately 47% interest in Rensburg Sheppards issued share capital During the five year period that Investec has been a major shareholder of Rensburg Sheppards the company has made strong progress in developing and growing its business and has been successful in its business strategy.
As a shareholder, Investec has benefited from the business development, solid price performance and consistent dividend stream that have been delivered 7 Investec believes that Rensburg Sheppards business is a core component of the Investec group and this has been indicated by Investecs continued shareholding level and support Investec intends to retain Rensburg Sheppards brand for the business acquired in order to maximise the opportunity in the UK onshore market and is enthusiastic about supporting Rensburg Sheppards continued business development including any future consolidation strategy Investec believes that this combination of Investecs existing wealth management businesses with that of Rensburg Sheppards will create a strong wealth management platform allowing it to significantly enhance its strategic position and that there is great potential to generate longer term value and a more stable future for the combined business and its employees following completion of this transaction.
Salient features of the offer Under the terms of the offer, Rensburg Sheppards shareholders will receive 1.63 fully paid newly issued Investec shares in exchange for each fully paid Rensburg Sheppards share currently held The offer values each Rensburg Sheppards share at 916 pence based on the closing price of Investec of 562 pence on 29 March 2010 being the last business day prior to the date of the announcement and start of the offer period The value of 916 pence for each Rensburg Sheppards share represents a premium of approximately 48% to the closing midmarket price per Rensburg Sheppards share, of 620 pence, on 29 March 2010.
The new Investec shares to be issued under the scheme are expected to represent approximately 7.8% of the issued share capital of Investec plc and 5.1% of the combined issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited.
Investecs current plans for Rensburg Sheppards do not involve any material change in its executive management team, operating structure or commercial offering.
There is limited overlap between Investec and Rensburg Sheppards operations ensuring continuity for clients and employees.
Upon or shortly after the scheme becoming effective, the London Stock Exchange will be requested to cancel trading in Rensburg Sheppards shares on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities and the UK Listing Authority will be requested to cancel the listing of the Rensburg Sheppards shares from the Official List.

Hedges The group uses derivatives for the management of financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with nontrading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the central Treasury in the Capital Markets business.
Once aggregated and netted Treasury as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages, the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, Treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and nontrading interest rate risk within defined parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependant on the classification between fair value hedges and cash flow hedges and in particular accounting hedges require the identification of a direct relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedges achieved by the group.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of fixed rate financial instruments attributable to interest rates.
Hedges continued Cash flow hedges The group is exposed to variability in cash flows on future liabilities arising from changes in base interest rates.
The aggregate expected cash flows are hedged based on cash flow forecasts with reference to terms and conditions present in the affected contractual arrangements.
Changes in fair value are initially recognised in equity and transferred to the income statement when the cash flow occurs.
The nominal expected future cash flows that are subject to cash flow hedges are: Description of financial instrument Period designated as Fair value cash flows are At 31 March hedging of hedging expected to 000 instrument instrument occur 2010 Assets Interest rate swap 504 1 to 5 Years USD and EUR floating rate debt Cross currency swap 14 966 1 to 5 years Liabilities Interest rate swap Var.
