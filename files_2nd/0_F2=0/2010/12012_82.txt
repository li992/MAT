Prior year aDJustment accounting policy for service concession arrangements The application of IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements has required a restatement of amounts for prior years.
Where a contract for the provision of public services meets the scope of IFRIC 12 the service concession is to be treated as a contract receivable, split between the profit on the construction of assets, operation of the service and provision of finance through interest receivable.
The Groups existing contract with West Sussex County Council for the provision of waste collection and disposal services falls within the scope of IFRIC 12.
