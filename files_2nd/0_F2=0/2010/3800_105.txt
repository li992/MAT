22 Post-employment benefit obligations Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups assets.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 3% to 35% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 54 million 2009: 44 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK schemes Within the UK there are three main arrangements: i Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan : ii Compass Pension Scheme the Scheme : and iii Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This has been the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK since that date but existing members of the Plan and the Scheme had continued to accrue benefits under those arrangements up until 5 April 2010.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Plan and the Scheme are defined benefit arrangements.
They have been closed to new entrants since 2003 other than for transfers under public sector contracts where the Group is obliged to provide final salary benefits to transferring employees.
Such transferees enter into the GAD sections of the Plan GAD members.
On 5 April 2010, the Plan and Scheme closed to future accrual for all existing members, other than those within the special sections of the Plan and Scheme for GAD members.
The affected members were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2010 103 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2010 22 Post-employment benefit obligations continued The Plan and the Scheme are operated on a pre-funded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
Formal actuarial valuations of the Plan and the Scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent valuations were as at 5 April 2010.
The final results revealed a worsening in the funding positions since the previous valuations, although the effects of poor investment returns during the intervening period were lessened by the cautious investment strategy that has been set for these schemes.
Under the funding schedule agreed with the Plan and Scheme Trustees, the Group aims to eliminate the current deficit over the next eight years.
The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 5 April 2013.
The Plan and the Scheme are re-appraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requirements.
The Company, together with the relevant Trustees, is considering the possibility of merging the Plan and the Scheme in order to remove the duplication of effort and create cost efficiencies in the administration of the arrangements.
The potential target date for a merger is 5 April 2011.
The Chairman, Tony Allen, is independent.
The other six Trustee Directors are UK-based employees of the Group, three of whom have been member-nominated.
The Plan has a Corporate Trustee.
The Chairman, Peter Morriss, is independent.
There are a further seven Trustee Directors who are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, four of whom have been member-nominated although one of these positions is vacant.
The Scheme is a closed defined benefit arrangement and also has a Corporate Trustee.
The Chairman, David Bishop, is independent.
The remaining six Trustee Directors are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been member-nominated.
Overseas schemes In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of multi-employer union sponsored pension plans, primarily in the USA.
These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The Group made total contributions of 7 million in the year 2009: 3 million to these arrangements.
Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.
