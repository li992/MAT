234 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 25 Financial investments This note analyses our financial investments by type and shows their cost and fair value.
These will change from one period to the next as a result of new business written, claims paid and market movements.
Other debt securities of 8,556 million 2009: 11,971 million primarily include residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, as well as other structured credit securities.
Following a review of the Groups investment classifications, comparative amounts for equity securities and other investments have been amended from amounts previously reported, reflecting the fact that equity and debt securities held indirectly through majority owned consolidated mutual funds in France managed by third parties, which in 2009 were presented as unit trusts and other investment vehicles within other investments, are now presented as debt and equity securities.
The effect is to increase equity and debt securities by 2,085 million and 1,247 million and decrease unit trusts and other investment vehicles within other investments by 3,332 million.

236 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 25 Financial investments continued c Impairment of financial investments The movements in impairment provisions on available-for-sale financial investments for the years ended 31 December 2009 and 2010 were as follows: Fixed maturity Equity Other securities securities investments Total m m m m At 1 January 2009 225 1,036 1,261 Increase for the year charged to the income statement 93 384 5 482 Write back following sale or reimbursement 174 401 575 Foreign exchange rate movements 25 85 2 108 At 31 December 2009 119 934 7 1,060 Increase for the year charged to the income statement 79 100 179 Write back following sale or reimbursement 48 175 223 Write back following recovery in value 1 1 2 Foreign exchange rate movements 2 33 31 At 31 December 2010 151 825 7 983 d Financial investment arrangements i Stock lending arrangements The Group has entered into stock lending arrangements in the UK and overseas in accordance with established market conventions.
The majority of the Groups stock lending transactions occurs in the UK, where investments are lent to EEA-regulated, locally domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.
It is not the Groups practice to enter into stock lending or repurchase agreements which result in the derecognition of financial assets from our balance sheet.
Financial assets subject to such agreements are sold to be repurchased at a fixed price, usually market price on execution, or loaned for a fee.
The Group therefore retains exposure to the market risks of the transferred securities.
Because, as transferor, we have retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred securities, they remain on balance sheet.
The Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements.
Collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title always occurs for collateral received, although no market risk or economic benefit is taken.
The level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Groups risk exposure.
In certain markets, the Group or the Groups appointed stock lending managers obtain legal ownership of the collateral received and can re-pledge it as collateral elsewhere or sell outright in the absence of default.
The carrying amount of financial assets received in this manner at 31 December 2010 was 15,858 million 2009: 16,909 million.
The value of collateral that was actually sold in the absence of default was nil 2009: nil.
In addition to the above, the Group has received and pledged cash collateral under stock lending arrangements that has been recognised in the statement of financial position with a corresponding obligation or receivable for its return.
These latter balances are shown in notes 50 and 26 respectively.
ii Stock repurchase arrangements Included within financial investments are 853 million 2009: 664 million of debt securities and other fixed income securities which have been sold under stock repurchase arrangements.
The obligations arising under these arrangements are shown in note 50. iii Other arrangements In carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Groups UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders.
Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits.
At 31 December 2010, 910 million 2009: 703 million of financial investments were restricted in this way.
Certain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the cies issued in those countries.
Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.
