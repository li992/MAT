Dividends 2010 2009 m m Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Final dividend for the year ended 24 January 2009 of 37p 2008: 37p per share 71.5 71.8 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 January 2010 of 19p 2009: 18p per share 37.0 34.7 108.5 106.5 Proposed final dividend for the year ended 30 January 2010 of 47p 2009: 37p per share 85.8 71.4 The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The Trustee of the ESOT has waived dividends paid in the year on shares held by the ESOT.
Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on 364.1m 2009: 302.4m being the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent company and 193.1m ordinary shares of 10p each 2009: 193.8m, being the weighted average number of shares in issue less the weighted average number of shares held by the ESOT during the year.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on 364.1m 2009: 302.4m being the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent company and 205.2m ordinary shares of 10p each 2009: 194.0m, being the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic earnings per share above increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares from employee share option schemes of 12.1m shares 2009: 0.2m.
The total number of share options outstanding at 30 January 2010 was 13.1m 2009: 12.9m, the increase in dilutive shares is a consequence of the higher average share price during the year ended 30 January 2010 compared to the previous year.
As at 22 March 2010 employee share options over 148,937 shares had been exercised subsequent to the balance sheet date and had been satisfied by ordinary shares issued by the ESOT.

The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the following cash generating units: 2010 2009 m m Next Sourcing 30.5 36.2 Lipsy 12.0 11.9 Eastern European owned stores 1.6 42.5 49.7 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date on the basis of value in use.
Next Sourcing The decrease in the goodwill balance relating to Next Sourcing arises from final agreement of deferred consideration payable on its acquisition, which will be settled during 2010.
In the year ended January 2010, Next Sourcing generated an operating profit before interest of 35.7m 2009: 32.0m.
Since this exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill, no further sensitivity calculations are necessary to conclude that there is no impairment.
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 January 2010 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 65 10.
Intangible assets continued Lipsy In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangibles, the five year business plan for Lipsy was used and cash flows beyond this period extrapolated using a growth rate of 2% 2009: 2%, and discounted at 15.0% 2009: 15%.
The key assumption in the calculation is the net contribution margin of the retail and internet channels.
The calculated value in use was significantly in excess of carrying value of the related goodwill and intangible assets, and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to conclude that there is no impairment at January 2010.
Eastern European owned stores The key assumptions in the calculation are the number of retail stores and like for like sales growth.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 12.0% 2009: 12%.
At January 2010, the value in use calculation did not support the carrying value of the goodwill and accordingly an impairment charge was recognised to reduce the carrying amount to nil.
11. Business combinations In the year ended 24 January 2009 the Group made the following acquisitions: Lipsy Limited On 29 September 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Lipsy Limited, a private company incorporated in England.

Retirement benefit plans continued The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was undertaken by an independent qualified actuary as at 30 January 2010 using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were as follows: 2010 2009 Discount rate 5.70% 6.50% Salary increases 3.60% 3.80% Inflation 3.60% 3.80% Pension increases 3.60% 3.80% Expected rate of return on assets Equities 7.70% 8.15% Bonds 4.80% 6.40% Gilts 4.15% 4.85% Property 6.25% 7.90% Other 4.15% 4.85% Average 6.13% 7.10% Life expectancy at age 65 years Pensioner aged 65 male 23.6 23.5 Pensioner aged 65 female 25.7 25.5 Non-pensioner aged 40 male 25.6 25.9 Non-pensioner aged 40 female 27.6 27.9 Expected rates of return on plan assets are based on external historical and forecast market information.
The key sensitivity in the calculation is the discount rate applied.
A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would result in an increase in scheme liabilities of approximately 12%.
Pension contributions for the Group will continue to be set at a level that takes account of the past service funding position of the plan.
The Group presently makes employer contributions at 17.5%.
Total employer contributions of 46.7m 2009: 24.2m were made during the year, including 32.5m 2009: 12.5m in respect of the deficit on the defined benefit section and contributions of 3.8m 2009: 2.5m in respect of the defined contribution section.
In addition to regular contributions to the defined benefit section estimated at 10.0m next year, the Group is committed to making further contributions in respect of the plan deficit totalling 40.0m over the period to March 2013.
At the year end, outstanding contributions to the defined contribution section included in other creditors were nil 2009: 0.4m.

The expected life applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises.
Shares held by ESOT The Next 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT has an independent professional trustee resident in Jersey and provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options, at the discretion of the Trustee.
At 30 January 2010 the ESOT held 3,638,271 2009: 4,076,763 ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company, the market value of which amounted to 71.5m 2009: 44.7m.
Details of outstanding share options are shown in Note 28.
The consideration paid for the ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company held by the ESOT at 30 January 2010 and 24 January 2009 has been shown as an ESOT reserve and presented within equity for the Company and the Group.
All other assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT have been incorporated into the accounts of the Company and the Group.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 76 30.
Financial instruments: risk management Next operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts and loans, and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities: Less than 1 to 2 2 to 5 Over 1 year years years 5 years Total 2010 m m m m m Bank loans and overdrafts 4.7 4.7 Trade and other payables 379.5 379.5 Finance lease liabilities 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.1 1.1 Corporate bonds 28.0 28.0 325.1 279.4 660.5 Other liabilities 90.0 90.0 502.6 28.2 325.5 279.5 1,135.8 Derivatives: net settled 5.5 3.5 13.5 0.6 23.1 Derivatives: gross settled Cash inflows 682.0 682.0 Cash outflows 673.8 673.8 Total cash flows 488.9 24.7 312.0 278.9 1,104.5 Less than 1 to 2 2 to 5 Over 1 year years years 5 years Total 2009 m m m m m Bank loans and overdrafts 121.6 121.6 Trade and other payables 345.9 345.9 Finance lease liabilities 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.3 1.6 Corporate bonds 30.4 30.4 391.3 294.1 746.2 498.3 30.8 391.8 294.4 1,215.3 Derivatives: net settled 1.3 3.0 11.5 13.2 Derivatives: gross settled Cash inflows 798.9 798.9 Cash outflows 718.2 718.2 Total cash flows 418.9 27.8 380.3 294.4 1,121.4 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 January 2010 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 77 30.
Financial instruments: risk management continued At 30 January 2010 the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 295.0m 2009: 445.0m in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met and which expire in July 2013.
None of this facility was drawn down at 30 January 2010 2009: 75.0 of a 150.0m facility expiring in November 2010.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.
Foreign currency risk The Groups principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for but does not demand that these exposures are hedged for up to 18 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.
This hedging activity involves the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange derivatives is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and manage the Groups ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas assets or liabilities and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are detailed in the table below.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies, taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 34.

Concentrations of risk are mitigated by the use of a number of different counterparties at any one time.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base being large and diverse.
The Groups outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 15.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 35, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share, the Group has been returning capital to shareholders by way of share buy backs in addition to dividends.
Share buy backs are transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share purchases.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 78 31.
Financial instruments: hedging activities Foreign currency: cash flow hedges The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising on expected future purchases of overseas sourced products during the next twelve months.
These derivatives comprise forward currency contracts and currency options, the terms of which match the terms of the expected purchases.
Fair values of foreign exchange derivatives are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Derivatives in designated hedging relationships 7.7 72.0 Other foreign exchange derivatives 2.7 3.4 Total foreign exchange derivatives 5.0 68.6 The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts to which the Group was committed at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2010 2009 m m US Dollar 599.8 752.4 Euro 76.2 32.8 Other 6.0 13.7 682.0 798.9 Interest rates: fair value hedges At 30 January 2010 and 24 January 2009, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys 5.25% 2013 corporate bond.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the bond, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest of 5.25% and pays a variable rate.
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 21.
At 30 January 2010 the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of 50m of the Companys 5.875% 2016 corporate bond.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the bond, the Group receives a fixed rate of 5.875% and pays a combination of a variable rate and a lower fixed rate.
Interest rates: cash flow hedges At 24 January 2009 the Group had other interest rate derivatives in place as cash flow hedges in respect of variable rate interest payments.
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group paid a fixed rate of interest between 1.74% and 4.89% and received a variable rate 6 month LIBOR.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate swaps are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 19.5 14.1 Derivatives in designated cash flow hedging relationships 2.4 Other interest rate derivatives 1.2 Total interest rate derivatives 18.3 11.7 Other interest rate derivatives relate to economic hedges of variable rate interest payments due under swaps relating to the 2013 corporate bond which are not able to be hedge accounted for under IAS 39.
The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments: fair values The fair values of each category of the Groups financial instruments are the same as their carrying values in the Groups balance sheet, other than as noted below: 2010 2009 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Corporate bonds In hedging relationships 320.9 326.0 317.8 266.1 Not in hedging relationships 200.0 214.9 250.0 202.8 520.9 540.9 567.8 468.9 The fair values of corporate bonds are their market values at the balance sheet date.
Market values include credit risk and are therefore different to the reported carrying value of bonds in fair value hedging relationships, which adjusts the nominal value of the bond for changes in interest rate risk only.
Corporate bonds not in hedging relationships are carried at unadjusted amortised cost.
Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 1.0% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: n For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
n Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.

These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of between 3 months and 22 years.
Contingent rentals are payable on certain retail store leases based on store revenues.
The majority of the Groups operating leases provide for their renewal by mutual agreement at the expiry of the lease term.
