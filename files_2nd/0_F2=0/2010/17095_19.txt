Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The significant activities of the Group are described in note 4, segment information.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting and preparation The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
As noted in the policy on non GAAP performance measures below, the definition of underlying profit has been amended.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Groups annual financial statements for the year ended 26 February 2009, except for the adoption of the following new Standards and Interpretations that are applicable for the year ended 4 March 2010: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations The standard has been amended to clarify the definition of vesting conditions and to prescribe the accounting of an award that is effectively cancelled because a non-vesting condition is not satisfied.
The adoption of this amendment did not have any material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The amended standard requires additional disclosures of fair value measurement and liquidity risk.
Fair value measurements relating to items recorded at fair value are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value.
In addition, a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance for level 3 fair value measurements is now required, as well as significant transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy.
The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures with respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity management.
The fair value measurement disclosures are presented in note 26.
The liquidity risk disclosures are not significantly impacted by the amendments and are presented in note 25.
As permitted by the amended standard, comparative information for the disclosures required by the amendments has not been provided in the first year of implementation.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments This standard sets out requirements for disclosure of information about an entitys operating segments, its products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers.
The Group determined that the operating segments were the same as the business segments previously identified under IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
Additional disclosures about each of these segments are shown in note 4, including revised comparative information.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements The revised standard has required the reconciliation of movements in equity, previously disclosed in the notes, to be presented as a primary statement entitled Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
In addition, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense has been replaced with the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The revised standard requires this statement to present all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements.
The Group has elected to present two statements.
IAS 23 Borrowing costs revised The standard has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying asset.
The revision to this standard has had no effect on the financial position or performance of the Group as borrowing costs have already been capitalised under the previously allowed alternative treatment.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes This interpretation requires customer loyalty award points to be accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted.
Where award credits are collected on behalf of a third party, they should not be disclosed as revenue.
The adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associates incorporated within these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The financial statements of material subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company.
co. uk 66 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 2 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation continued Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 1, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from or up to the date that control passes respectively.
All intraGroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Significant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
With the exception of overseas trading licences, which are deemed to have an infinite life, intangible assets are amortised over periods of up to 15 years.
Amortisation is reported within administrative expenses in the income statement.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Prior to the 1999 2000 financial year, properties were regularly revalued on a cyclical basis.
Since this date the Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, while previous valuations have been retained, they have not been updated.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of qualifying assets are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold land is not depreciated Freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years Plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the value of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases represent prepaid lease payments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets cash generating units or CGUs.
If such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the CGUs recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
67 2 Accounting policies continued Impairment continued The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative and distribution line items.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates that the fair value less costs to sell of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment the Group considers CGUs to be each trading outlet.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset, either from independent sources or in conjunction with an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Such assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortised.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs of disposal.
Provisions Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Non GAAP performance measure In the prior year, the Group introduced an underlying profit measure on the face of the income statement.
The directors have continued with this measure but refined it so that it now excludes only exceptional items and the impact of IAS 19 Income Statement finance charge credit for pensions.
The face of the income statement presents underlying profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented under the applicable accounting standards.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated having adjusted profit after tax for the same items, their tax effect and the effect of any exceptional tax items.
The term underlying profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of profit.
The adjustments made to reported profit in the income statement in order to present an underlying performance measure include: http: annualreport.
co. uk 68 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 2 Accounting policies continued Exceptional items The Group includes in non GAAP performance measures those items which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group includes the profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions and impairment in exceptional items.
IAS 19 Income Statement finance charge credit for defined benefit pension schemes Underlying profit includes the service costs but excludes the volatile finance cost revenue element of IAS 19.
Taxation The tax impact of the above items is also excluded in arriving at underlying earnings.
Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency generally sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Day to day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge, in which case translation differences are reported in other comprehensive income.
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non sterling functional currency.
These are translated into sterling in the Group accounts.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Revenue recognition Generally, revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting discounts and sales-based taxes.
The following is a description of the composition of revenues of the Group: Rendering of services Owned hotel revenue, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from a network of hotels, is recognised when rooms are occupied and food and beverages are sold.
Revenue from franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names is recognised when earned.
Royalties Royalties are recognised as the income is earned.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of food and beverages is recognised when they are sold.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for any unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
69 2 Accounting policies continued Retirement benefits continued For defined benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within finance costs.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payment transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
Except for awards subject to market related conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
If options are subject to market related conditions, awards are not cumulatively adjusted for the likelihood of these targets being met.
Instead these conditions are included in the fair value of the awards.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts, that have originated but have not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are established through an interest in a company a jointly controlled entity.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset.
The derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
co. uk 70 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 2 Accounting policies continued Financial Assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
On initial recognition these assets are recognised at fair value.
Subsequent measurement is also at fair value with changes recognised through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest risks associated with underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Cash flow hedges hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The portion of any gains or losses of cash flow hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined to be effective hedges, is recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and the redemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates Key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation, at the balance sheet date have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
71 2 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting judgements and estimates continued Note 15 describes the assumptions used in impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Note 32 describes the assumptions used in accounting for retirement benefit obligations together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material income statement and or cash flow variances.
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB not effective for the current year and not adopted by the Group The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, become effective after the current year end and have not been early adopted by the Group: IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised IFRS 3 revised introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date.
Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interest, the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of a contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages.
These changes will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs and future reported results.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements amended IAS 27 amended requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners.
Therefore, such transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill, nor will it give rise to a gain or loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The changes by IFRS 3 revised and IAS 27 amended will affect future acquisitions or loss of control of subsidiaries and transactions with non-controlling interests.

No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.
co. uk 72 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 4 Segment information continued Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance.
Segment performance is measured based on operating profit before exceptional items.
Included within the unallocated and elimination columns in the tables below are functions managed by a central division including the costs of running the public company.
The unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances held and controlled by the central treasury function, taxation, pensions, certain property, plant and equipment and central working capital balances.
Sales to Costa franchise partners were previously categorised as unallocated but are now included within Costa restated for 2009.
Inter-segment revenue is from Costa to the Hotels & Restaurants segment and is eliminated on consolidation.
Transactions were entered into on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding business operating segments for the years ended 4 March 2010 and 26 February 2009.

During the year a net profit of 14.6m was recognised on disposals of property, plant and equipment.
In addition, following the entry of First Quench Retailing into administration on 29 October 2009, a provision has been raised for a total of 130 properties for which the Group has an obligation.
Premier Inn rebranding costs in the prior year relate to asset write off and brand relaunch costs.
The pension curtailment credit arose due to the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual on 31 December 2009 note 32.
In 2007 8, the Group sold its interests in David Lloyd Leisure Limited and TGI Fridays.
Following these disposals it was announced that the Restaurant and Hotels divisions would merge and that the shared service teams would be disbanded.
This restructuring includes the final costs associated with the aligning of IT with the new structures.
This then completes the income statement impact of the restructuring programme that was announced in 2007 8.
T he interest arising on late payment of an item claimed in a previous year, which is disputed, is included in exceptional interest charges.
Reduction in deferred tax liability on rolled over gains for differences between the tax deductible cost and accounts residual value of the reinvestment assets.
The deferred tax charge in the prior year arose as a result of the enactment by the UK government, in July 2008, of the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances for hotel buildings.

10 Business combinations On 18 February 2010 Costa Coffee Limited acquired the entire issued share capital of Coffeeheaven International plc for a total cash consideration of 37.2m, equivalent to 24 pence per ordinary share.
Coffeeheaven International plc is the leading coffee chain in central and eastern Europe, with 89 stores throughout Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria and Latvia.
77 10 Business combinations continued The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses as at the date of acquisition, and the corresponding carrying amounts immediately before the acquisition were: Book Provisional fair value value to Group m m Property, plant and equipment note 14 10.6 8.3 Inventories 0.6 0.6 Cash 3.0 3.0 Trade and other receivables 4.4 4.4 Overdrafts and loans 0.3 0.3 Trade and other payables 6.1 6.1 Net assets 12.2 9.9 Intangible assets in relation to the Coffeeheaven brand name 5.1 Deferred tax liability in relation to the Coffeeheaven brand name 1.0 Goodwill arising on acquisition note 13 23.2 Total consideration 37.2 Cash flow on acquisition: Cash acquired 3.0 Overdrafts and loans acquired 0.3 Cash paid 37.2 Net cash outflow 34.5 The consideration includes 1.1m of costs associated with the acquisition, paid in cash.
Fair values are described as provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end.
In arriving at the fair value of property, plant and equipment an adjustment of 2.3m has been made to impair the carrying value of a number of leasehold sites.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Coffeeheaven International plc arises as a result of the expected synergies from the business combination together with the benefits of the assembled workforce of the acquired business.
From the date of acquisition, the company acquired contributed 1.0m revenue and no profit to the net profit of the Group.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group would have been decreased by 1.2m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been increased by 22.8m.
On 18 February 2010 Premier Inn India Limited acquired 50.1% of Premier Inn India Private Limited, which it previously did not own, for 5.5m in cash.

In arriving at fair value of property, plant and equipment an adjustment of 0.4m has been made to write off costs which had been inappropriately capitalised.
No goodwill arose on the original investment in the joint venture.
From the date of acquisition, the company acquired contributed no revenue and a loss of 0.1m to the net profit of the Group.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group would have been decreased by 1.6m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been increased by 0.1m.

The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period.

In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% 2008 9: 10.0%.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five year period.
These business plans and forecasts include managements most recent and cautious view of medium term trading prospects.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 2008 9: 2.0%.
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment loss of 11.3m are set out below: Hotels & Restaurants The impairment at 25 sites in the strategic business unit was driven by a number of factors Changes in the local competitive environment in which the hotels are situated Impairment of assets held for sale to their recoverable value High asset prices in the market at the point of acquisition for acquired sites which also anticipated higher growth rates at that time than are now expected.
Costa Nine Costa sites with an established trend of poor performance against the required capital investment have been impaired where their expected future cash flows have fallen to such a level that their value in use is below carrying value.
Impairment reversals Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously impaired sites, reversals of 9.8m have been recognised.
co. uk 82 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 15 Impairment continued Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the five year business plan and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Hotels & Restaurants Costa Total m m m Impairment if business plan growth rates were r educed by 1% 17.1 1.3 18.4 Impairment if discount rate was increased by 1% 16.7 1.3 18.0 Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
This is calculated using the five year business plans approved by senior management.
The key assumptions in these calculations relate to revenue and the increase in rooms.
The calculation is most sensitive to revenue assumptions, however senior management believe that the assumptions used are reasonable.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.0% 2008 9: 10.0%.
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of goodwill allocated to the Hotels & Restaurants CGU.
A review of goodwill created during the year concluded that there is insufficient post acquisition trading history to suggest any impairment.
Goodwill acquired in 2009 10 as part of the Coffeeheaven International plc acquisition will be assessed for impairment as part of the Costa goodwill impairment review in future years.

87 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing the risks summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term sterling debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The Groups policy is to fix on a long-term basis between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost over the next 15 years, which is beyond the life of the Groups existing revolving credit facilities.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations.
Most of the swaps held at the balance sheet date were entered into in January 2007 as part of a long-term fixing strategy.
However, following the reduction in debt during the year, at year end 400.0m 71.4% of Group debt was fixed for an average of 4.0 years 2009: 410.0m, 61.0%, for 4.9 years, using floating rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
The intention is that the fixed rate debt ratio will reduce going forward to come back in line with Group policy.
The average rate of interest on this fixed rate debt was 5.6% 2008 9: 5.6%.
In accordance with IFRS 7 the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 4 March 2010 and 26 February 2009 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in note 2: and cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.2m 2008 9: 2.2m, and equity by approximately 13.8m 2009: 19.6m.
Liquidity risk The Group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
In its funding strategy the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 4 March 2010 and 26 February 2009 based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest: On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 4 March 2010 m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 31.3 3.0 2.9 539.1 576.3 Derivative financial instruments 9.4 9.4 34.9 19.6 73.3 Trade and other payables 153.9 8.2 162.1 Accrued financial liabilities 79.4 79.4 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 19.3 19.1 9.6 48.0 31.3 166.3 111.0 601.3 29.2 939.1 On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 26 February 2009 m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 1.9 8.3 8.3 702.3 720.8 Derivative financial instruments 5.9 5.9 30.9 16.4 59.1 Trade and other payables 134.5 7.9 142.4 Accrued financial liabilities 73.3 73.3 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 13.3 10.5 6.5 30.3 1.9 148.7 100.8 751.6 22.9 1,025.9 http: annualreport.
co. uk 88 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 20.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Groups banks get into financial difficulties the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of currently undrawn committed facilities.
This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been carried out.
Overseas investments are generally start-up businesses undertaken through joint venture arrangements.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and when they are required.
Capital management The Groups primary objectives in regard to capital management are to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern and has sufficient funds, depending on the economic environment, at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants.
It aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital, further investment in order to meet growth targets and to ensure that access is available to the capital markets.
The Group has adopted a framework to keep leverage on a pensions lease adjusted basis at 3.5 times or below.
All of these matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes.
In addition, the Board regularly reviews the Groups dividend policy and funding strategy.
26 Financial instruments Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.

The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
89 26 Financial instruments continued Level 2 Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Derivative financial instruments Hedges Cash flow hedges At 4 March 2010 the Group had interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of 400.0m 2009: 410.0m whereby it receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145% and 5.695% 2009: 5.145% and 5.745%.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows from variable rate debt.
Cash flow hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown in note 25.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 4 March 2010 and a net unrealised gain of 3.0m 2008 9: net unrealised loss of 29.6m has been recorded in other comprehensive income.
During the year, a loss of 15.9m 2008 9: 0.3m was recycled from equity to the income statement in respect of hedged items affecting the net finance charge for the year.

co. uk 92 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 30 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Hotels & Restaurants and Costa businesses.
The leases are non-cancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases various plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor that changes other than with the passage of time e. g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices, future market rates of interest.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Due within one year 93.0 74.6 Due after one year but not more than five years 312.2 248.3 Due after five years but not more than ten years 266.9 206.9 Due after ten years 957.1 791.2 1,629.2 1,321.0 Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed above includes 84.3m in relation to privity contracts.
Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerous contracts provision note 24.
Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce this obligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases is 17.3 years 2009: 18.6 years.
Group companies have sub-let space in certain properties.
The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sublease agreements as at 4 March 2010 are 21.8m 2009: 25.1m.
Contingent liabilities There were no material contingent liabilities at 4 March 2010.
31 Share-based payment plans Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group.
Vesting of shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS performance targets over a three year period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen in the Remuneration report on pages 47 to 56.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2010 2009 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 359,254 266,413 Granted during the year 356,380 163,236 Exercised during the year 71,088 53,348 Expired during the year 14,324 17,047 Outstanding at the end of the year 630,222 359,254 Exercisable at the end of the year 93 31 Share-based payment plans continued Deferred equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 5.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date.
If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full.
If employment ceases for any other reason the proportion of awards which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date that employment ceased.
If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the first and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 50% vests.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2010 2009 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 385,729 227,834 Granted during the year 249,371 235,765 Exercised during the year 172,047 77,797 Expired during the year 11,687 73 Outstanding at the end of the year 451,366 385,729 Exercisable at the end of the year Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Annual grants of share options have been discontinued, however options may be granted in exceptional circumstances, for example, on a senior recruitment or following an acquisition of a business.
No changes will be made to options already granted.
An earnings per share based performance condition will apply to any such options, and to the extent that the performance is not satisfied after three years, the option shall lapse as there is no opportunity to retest performance.
This was the case for the options granted in 2004, for which the performance target requires earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% over the three year performance period.
For options granted in 2005 the performance target requires earnings per share growth of RPI plus 4% per annum over the three consecutive financial years, these have now been met.
For options granted between June 2000 and June 2003 the performance conditions required the Companys adjusted earnings per share to exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the 10 year performance period starting from June 2000 and ending June 2013 depending on when the options were granted.
Movements in the number of share options and the related weighted average exercise price WAEP are as follows: 2010 2009 WAEP WAEP Options per share Options per share Outstanding at the beginning of the year 584,616 7.06 631,516 7.11 Exercised during the year 561,349 6.92 46,900 7.69 Expired during the year 21,500 11.01 Outstanding at the end of the year 1,767 5.39 584,616 7.06 Exercisable at the end of the year 1,767 5.39 584,616 7.06 The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 4 March 2010 is between one and two years and they are exercisable at a price of 5.39 2009: prices between 5.39 and 11.01.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for ESOS options exercised during the year was 12.99. http: annualreport.
co. uk 94 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 31 Share-based payment plans continued Employee share scheme The employee share save scheme is open to employees with the required minimum period of service and provides for a purchase price equal to the market price on the date of grant, less a 20% discount.
The shares can be purchased over the six month period following the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement date, depending on the length chosen by the employee.
Movements in the number of share options and the related WAEP are as follows: 2010 2009 WAEP WAEP Options per share Options per share Outstanding at the beginning of the year 1,478,954 8.40 1,246,337 9.71 Granted during the year 379,528 10.08 958,965 7.28 Exercised during the year 171,364 8.58 349,048 6.86 Expired during the year 346,976 8.85 377,300 11.53 Outstanding at the end of the year 1,340,142 8.76 1,478,954 8.40 Exercisable at the end of the year 22,931 10.15 56,388 7.19 The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 4 March 2010 is between two and three years and are exercisable at prices between 6.53 and 14.17 2009: 6.11 and 14.17.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for employee share scheme options exercised during the year was 12.93.
Employment service 95 31 Share-based payment plans continued Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The risk-free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
At 4 March 2010 there were outstanding options for employees to purchase up to 1.3m 2009: 2.1m ordinary shares of 76.80 pence each between 2010 and 2015 at prices between 5.39 and 14.17 per share 2009: between 2009 and 2015 at prices between 5.39 and 14.17 per share.
Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.
32 Retirement benefits Defined contribution schemes The Group operated a defined contribution Pension Scheme which closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
A replacement, contracted-in, defined contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with effect from 1 April 2002.
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trusteeadministered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes.
The total cost charged to income in relation to defined contribution schemes in the year was 2.0m 2008 9: 2.0m.
At the year end, 1,641 employees 2009: 782 were active members of the schemes, which also had 6,769 deferred members 2009: 6,747.
Defined benefit schemes The defined benefit final salary section of the principal Group Pension Scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
The scheme is funded, and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee administered funds.
At the year end the scheme had no active members 2009: 885, 26,744 deferred pensioners 2009: 27,584 and 15,998 pensions in payment 2009: 15,645.
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2008.
A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the scheme remains in deficit have been agreed with the Trustee.
The Group will make the following payments to the Fund: 55m in each of August 2011, August 2012 and August 2013: 65m in each of August 2014 and August 2015: 70m in August 2016: 80m in each of August 2017 and August 2018.
For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower.
Until the next valuation the Trustee has also been given a promise of participation in increases in ordinary dividends where these exceed RPI and the right to consultation before any special distribution can be made.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership, which was established by the Group during the year the share in profits will be accounted for by the Group as contributions when paid.
The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner, and by the Pension Scheme following a 102m investment made by the Pension Scheme Trustee during the year.
co. uk 96 Annual Report 2009 10 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 4 March 2010 32 Retirement benefits continued Defined benefit schemes continued Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership, which was also established by the Group during the year.
Property assets with a market value of 221m have been transferred from other Group companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
However, the Trustee has first charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of 228m.
The Group retains control over both partnerships, and as such they are fully consolidated in these Group financial statements.
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership over the next 15 years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will be changed, depending on the funding position of the Scheme at that time, to a value up to 110m.
At that point, the Group may be required to transfer this amount in cash to the Scheme.
Under IAS 19 the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly the pension deficit position in these Group financial statements does not reflect the 102m investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme.
The total service cost contributions to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund in 2010 11 are expected to be nil.
The IAS 19 pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Lane Clark & Peacock and Hewitts, using the projected unit credit method.
As the scheme is now closed to future accrual, there will be no service cost in the future.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation carried out as at 31 March 2008 of the UK schemes to 4 March 2010 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 4 March 26 February 2010 2009 1 Rate of increase in salaries n a 4.10% Pre April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.30% 3.00% Post April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.20% 2.10% Discount rate 5.60% 6.60% Inflation assumption 3.50% 3.10% 1.
The Whitbread Group Pension Fund was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
From this point active members benefits only increase in line with inflation.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.6 years 2009: 20.4 if they are male and for a further 23.1 years 2009: 23.0 if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2030 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.5 years 2009: 22.4 after retirement if they are male and for a further 24.9 years 2009: 24.8 after retirement if they are female.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each actual asset allocation for the Fund at 4 March 2010 rounded to the nearest 0.1% per annum.
97 32 Retirement benefits continued Defined benefit schemes continued The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 3.3% 2009: 3.6% per annum above inflation.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2009 10 2008 9 m m Current service cost 4.5 4.5 Curtailments 4.0 Recognised in arriving at operating profit 0.5 4.5 Expected return on scheme assets 70.5 90.5 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 86.0 85.0 Other finance revenue cost note 8 15.5 5.5 The amounts taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income are as follows: 2009 10 2008 9 m m Actual return on scheme assets 243.8 247.5 Less: expected return on scheme assets 70.5 90.5 Other actuarial gains and losses 369.0 82.5 195.7 255.5 The current service cost has been included in administrative expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Present value of defined benefit obligations 1,715.0 1,340.0 Fair value of scheme assets 1,281.0 1,107.0 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 434.0 233.0 During the year the accounting deficit increased from 233.0m at 26 February 2009 to 434.0m at 4 March 2010.
The main contributors to the increase were the change to the rate of interest used to discount the liabilities from 6.6% to 5.6% and the change to the rate of assumed inflation underlying the liabilities from 3.05% to 3.50%.
Both of these were offset by the actual return on assets over the year being higher than that needed to keep pace with the interest on liabilities.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Opening defined benefit obligation 1,340.0 1,405.0 Current service cost 4.5 4.5 Net interest cost 86.0 85.0 Actuarial losses gains on scheme liabilities 369.0 82.5 Contributions from scheme members 0.5 0.5 Benefits paid 75.0 72.5 Curtailments 4.0 Benefits settled by the Company in relation to an unfunded pension scheme 6.0 Closing defined benefit obligation 1,715.0 1,340.0 http: annualreport.
