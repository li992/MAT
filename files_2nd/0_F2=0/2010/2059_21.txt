Financial statements 132 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Supplementary information gas and oil unaudited On 20 December 2007, BGGroup ceased to be a United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC registered company and the Groups SEC reporting obligations also ceased with effect from that date.
BGGroup continues voluntarily to use the SEC definition of proved reserves to report proved gas and oil reserves and disclose certain unaudited supplementary information detailed on pages 132 to 138.
BGGroup also now uses SEC definitions introduced by the SEC in 2009 for probable reserves.
BGGroups strategy aims to connect competitively priced gas to high-value markets.
Hydrocarbon reserves, and gas in particular, are developed in relation to the markets that they are intended to supply.
Information in this section is therefore grouped as shown below to reflect the nature of the markets supplied by BGGroup.
UK Atlantic Basin Canada, Egypt, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago and the USA Asia and the Middle East Areas of Palestinian Authority, Australia, China, India, Kazakhstan, Oman and Thailand Rest of the World Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, Italy, Libya, Madagascar, Norway, Poland, Tanzania and Tunisia The Corporate Reserves Group CRG is a central multidisciplinary group of reserves experts with an average of 20 years experience in the oil and gas industry which provides an independent review of all reserves and discovered resources bookings and revisions proposed by Regions and Assets to the Reserves Committee.
Head of the Corporate Reserves Group Dr. Carolina Coll has more than 23 years experience in the oil and gas industry.
She has a degree in Physics, a PhD in petroleum engineering, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers SPE and the SPE Oil and Gas Reserves Committee.
Total additions and revisions to proved reserves during the year were 529 mmboe.
This includes revisions due to new data and improved reservoir performance 337 mmboe increase, extensions, discoveries and reclassifications 266 mmboe increase, acquisitions and disposals 12 mmboe decrease and the net effect of price movements 62 mmboe decrease.
Production in the period was 235.7 mmboe.
Gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly since estimation of reserves involves subjective judgement.
Therefore, all estimates are subject to revision.
Changes in gas and oil prices in fields subject to Production Sharing Contracts PSCs may result in changes to entitlements and therefore proved reserves.
PROVED RESERVES BGGroup utilises the SEC definition of proved reserves.
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.
Proved developed reserves are those reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved undeveloped reserves comprise total proved reserves less total proved developed reserves.
PROBABLE RESERVES BGGroup adopted the SEC definition of probable reserves in 2009.
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
Probable developed reserves are those reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and with existing equipment and operating methods.
Probable undeveloped reserves comprise total probable reserves less total probable developed reserves.
DISCOVERED RESOURCES Discovered resources are defined by BGGroup as the best estimate of recoverable hydrocarbons where commercial and or technical maturity is such that project sanction is not expected within the next three years.
RISKED EXPLORATION Risked exploration resources are defined by BGGroup as the best estimate mean value of recoverable hydrocarbons in a prospect multiplied by the chance of success.
TOTAL RESOURCES Total resources are defined by BGGroup as the aggregate of proved and probable reserves plus discovered resources and risked exploration.
Total resources may also be referred to as total reserves and resources.

Future cash inflows have been computed by reference to the Groups estimate of future production of net proved gas and oil reserves at the end of each year and estimates of third-party prices.
2010 and 2009 prices are calculated using a 12-month average price in line with the revised SEC methodology effective for the year ended 31December 2009.
2008 price calculations are based on year end prices.
The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flow information presented below is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair market value of the Groups gas and oil properties.
The disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserves, future production schedules and costs, which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision.
