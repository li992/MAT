Pricing For the purposes of valuing awards to calculate the share-based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used for all the share option and share matching schemes and for the LTIPs except for those granted since November 2005, where the Monte Carlo model has been used.
A summary of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for 2010 compared to 2009 is as follows: 2010 2009 Sharesave Share match Sharesave Share match Risk-free interest rate 1.4% 2.3% 2.0% 2.2% 3.0% 1.7% Volatility 31.0% 36.0% 36.0% 31.0% 36.0% 35.0% Expected lives of options granted 35yrs 6mths 3yrs 35yrs 6mths 3yrs Dividend yield 4.4% 4.4% 3.1% 3.1% Fair value 3.87 4.42 18.03 4.67 4.93 16.21 Share price used to determine option price 19.53 20.57 15.67 16.13 17.80 Exercise price 15.63 n a 12.54 12.91 n a Volatility is determined based on the three or five year share price history the time period being determined by the length of the scheme.
