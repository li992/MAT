In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amounts in respect of these cases in the consolidated financial statements.
In 2003 the Office of Fair Trading OFT commenced an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into the operation of the UK tobacco supply industry in the period from 2000 and 2003.
In a decision dated 15 April 2010, the OFT concluded that certain of the Groups promotional arrangements with tobacco retailers had the object of restricting competition and imposed a fine of 112.3 million on the Group.
At the same time it confirmed that two other allegations included in its 2008 statement of objections had been dropped.
The Group takes compliance with competition law very seriously and continues to reject any suggestion that it acted in breach of the Competition Act or in any way contrary to the interests of consumers.
On 15 June 2010 the Group submitted an appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal against the OFTs findings of infringement and the level of the fine.
Five tobacco retailers have also submitted appeals against the OFTs decision.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal may uphold, quash or vary the OFTs decision or the fine that has been imposed.
As part of its appeal the Group has asked for the fine to be quashed in its entirety.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amount in the consolidated financial statements.
