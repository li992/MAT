Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 1.
Corporate Information The consolidated financial information of SDL plc the Group for the year ended 31 December 2010 was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 21 March 2011.
SDL plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of SDL plc and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The principal activities of the Group are described in Note 4.
2 Accounting Policies Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements of SDL plc and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU as relevant to the financial statements of SDL plc.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP and these are presented on pages 108 to 119.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
Changes in accounting policy The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised Adoption of these revised standards and the interpretations did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group in the current or prior periods, except as disclosed below: IFRS 3 Business Combinations The Group adopted the revised standards from 1 January 2010.
IFRS 3 Revised introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date.
Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interest, the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of a contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages.
Transaction costs are recognised in administration expenses.
These changes impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs and future reported results.
IAS 27 Amended requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners.
Therefore, such transactions no longer give rise to goodwill, nor give rise to a gain or loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The changes required by IFRS 3 Revised and IAS 27 Amended will affect future acquisitions or loss of control of subsidiaries and transactions with non-controlling interests.
The change in accounting policy was applied prospectively and had no material impact on earnings per share or the results for the period ended 31 December 2010.
Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and all its subsidiaries for the full year or from the date of acquisition if later.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the date of 1 January 2004.
As a result, goodwill recognised as an asset at 31 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount under UK GAAP and is not amortised.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 76 Statutory Information 9 values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
If the business combination allows for a provision of contingent consideration, this will be provided in the accounts at the fair value to the extent it is considered probable that the liability will accrue.
If the business combination allows for deferred compensation this will be recognised in the income statement over the service period.
Intangible assets: Goodwill Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets.
This is usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions pre 1 January 2004 was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, which was presumed to be 8 years.
Any goodwill remaining on the balance sheet at 1 January 2004 is not amortised after 1 January 2004, but is also subject to annual impairment reviews.
Intangible assets: Other Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are held at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which are reassessed annually together with any assessment of residual value.
The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed over the expected period that benefits accrue to the group.
Amortisation is charged as a separate line item on the income statement.
Customer intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of between 5 and 7 years.
Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of between 5 and 15 years.
Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured and technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Where these criteria are not met the expenditure is expensed to the income statement.
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure the cost model is applied, requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Any expenditure carried forward is amortised over the period of expected future sales from the related project.
The carrying value of development costs is reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is not yet in use or more frequently when an indicator of impairment arises during the reporting year indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Development costs that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets: Impairment of assets An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where value in use is calculated as the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 77 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation and any impairment in value.
Historical cost includes the expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value based on prices at the balance sheet date of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Leasehold improvements The lower of ten years or the lease term straight line Computer equipment 45 years straight line Fixtures & fittings 20% reducing balance Motor vehicles 20% reducing balance Useful economic lives and residual values are assessed annually.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognising of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be measured reliably.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Rendering of services Revenue on service contracts is recognised only when their outcomes can be foreseen with reasonable certainty and is based on the percentage stage of completion of the contracts, calculated on the basis of costs incurred.
Accrued and deferred revenue arising on long-term contracts is included in trade receivables as accrued income and in trade and other payables as deferred income as appropriate.
Support and maintenance contracts are invoiced in advance and normally run for periods of 12 months with automatic renewal on the anniversary date.
Revenue in respect of support and maintenance contracts is recognised evenly over the 12 months commencing from the date of the contract period.
Managed services hosting fees are recognised over the term of the hosting contract on a straight-line basis.
Professional services and consulting revenue, which is provided on a time and expense basis, is recognised as the service is performed.
For multiple element arrangements revenue is allocated to each element on fair value regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract.
The portion of the revenue allocated to an element is recognised when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on despatch of the goods.
Revenue on software licenses and upgrades is recognised on despatch, when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining and the collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable.
In circumstances where a considerable future vendor obligation exists as part of a software licence and related services contract, revenue is recognised over the period that the obligation exists per the contract.
78 Statutory Information 9 Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowing that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity.
These are taken directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income until the date of disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries and branches are translated at the closing exchange rate.
Income statements of such undertakings are translated at the average rate of exchange during the year.
Gains and losses arising on these translations are taken to reserves.
As permitted by IFRS 1, SDL has elected to deem the cumulative amount of exchange differences arising on translation of the net investments in subsidiaries at 1 January 2004 to be nil.
Intra-company loans for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are defined as quasi-equity loans and the currency translation differences on retranslation at the balance sheet date are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency and interest rate contracts to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The derivatives entered into do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to net profit or loss for the period.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, unless they relate to capitalised research and development.
Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly within the Income Statement.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Incentives received from landlord In accordance with SIC 15, the aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a credit to the income statement.
The benefits of the incentives are allocated over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Pension cost The company contributes to a group personal pension scheme for qualifying employees whereby it makes defined contributions to independently administered personal pension schemes.
The company does not control any of the assets or have any ongoing liabilities with regard to the performance of and payments from these individual personal schemes.
SDL Global Solutions Ireland Limited operates a separate defined contribution scheme whose assets are held separately from the company.
The pension cost charge for both schemes represents contributions payable during the period.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 79 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Financial assets Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments, as appropriate.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets after initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classified as held for trading are included in the category financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.
Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated and effective hedging instruments.
Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in income.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such as exchange or modification, it is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of the new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the profit or loss.
Taxation The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed, based on tax rates that are enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except: where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
80 Statutory Information 9 Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
In the United Kingdom, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as remuneration on exercise of certain employee share options.
As explained under Share based payments below, a remuneration expense is recorded in the consolidated income statement over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options.
As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset may be recorded.
The deferred tax asset arising on share option awards is calculated as the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the Groups share price at the balance sheet date pro-rated to the extent that the services of the employee have been rendered over the vesting period.
If this amount exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
Similarly, current tax relief in excess of the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate is also recorded in retained earnings.
When deferred tax assets are recognised post acquisition, goodwill is adjusted accordingly.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of VAT except: where the VAT incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT included.
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Share based payments Employees including directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 81 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by using an appropriate option pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company market conditions.
The volatility in the models is calculated by reference to historical share price.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Group at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The expense is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the vesting period for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
National Insurance on Share Option Grants, the anticipated National Insurance charge on gains made by employees over the period from date of grant of the option to the end of the performance period has been provided for.
New standards and interpretations not applied IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Revised 1 January 2011 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and DisclosureRevised 1 February 2010 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Presentation 1 January 2013 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC Effective date IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 1 July 2010 Effective date refers to accounting periods commencing on or after the dates above.
Not yet endorsed by the European Union The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
82 Statutory Information 9 Significant critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions Judgements The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period.
However, uncertainty about these estimates and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: Research and development costs Management continually review research and development expenditure to assess whether any costs meet the criteria for capitalisation.
There have been no costs capitalised in 2010 2009: nil with the primary criteria for non capitalisation being technical and commercial feasibility achieved late in the development cycle for new product releases.
Revenuesale of goods Management reviews the terms of all license contracts to ensure that the appropriate fair values are determined and that there are no future vendor obligations that would affect the license revenue recognised.
Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions and estimates concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Revenuerendering of services Management makes estimates of the total costs that will be incurred by SDL on a contract by contract basis.
Management reviews the estimate of total costs on each contract on an ongoing basis to ensure that the revenue recognised accurately reflects the proportion of the work done at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determining the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.
This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 18.
Taxes Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income.
Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.
Differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective Group companys domicile.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
The Group has tax loss carry forwards amounting to 1,908,000 2009: 2,990,000.
These losses relate to subsidiaries that have a history of losses, do not expire and may not be used to offset taxable income elsewhere in the Group.
The subsidiaries have no taxable temporary differences or any tax planning opportunities available that could partly support the recognition of these losses as deferred tax assets.
Further details on taxes are disclosed in Note 6.

If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit after tax for the Group would have been 17.5 million and revenue from continuing operations would have been 174.0 million.
Included in the 4.0 million of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
4 Segment Information The Group operates in the Global Information Management industry.
For management purposes the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services and has three reportable operating segments as follows: The Language Services segment is the provision of a translation service to customers multilingual content in multiple languages.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 87 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued The Language Technologies segment is the sale of enterprise, desktop and statistical machine translation technology developed to help automate and manage multilingual assets together with associated consultancy and other services.
The Content Management Technologies segment is the sale of content management technologies developed to help automate and manage content to deliver a consistent, interactive and personalised customer experience, in multiple languages, across websites, documentation and channels.
Within the Content Management Technologies segment two operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segment.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment prior to charges for tax, deferred compensation related to business combinations and amortisation.

Other companies acquired have similar schemes for their qualifying members, although SDL Global Solutions Ireland Limited operates a defined contribution scheme with contributions made by the Company placed in a separately administered pension fund.
The pension cost charge for the year represents contributions payable by the Group to these schemes and amounted to 2,543,201 2009: 2,308,512.
The average number of employees during the year, including executive directors, was made up as follows: 2010 2009 No.

A tax credit in respect of share based compensation for deferred taxation of 342,000 2009: charge of 220,000 has been recognised in the statement of changes in equity in the year.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 91 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued b Factors affecting tax charge: The tax assessed on the profit on ordinary activities for the year is lower than the standard rate of income tax in the UK of 28% 2009: 28%.
The differences are reconciled below: 2010 2009 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 28,808 24,013 Profit on ordinary activities at standard rate of tax in the UK 28% 2009: 28% 8,066 6,724 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 928 191 Non deductible amortisation of intangibles 125 - Adjustments in respect of previous years 185 123 Utilisation of tax losses brought forward previously not recognised 2,932 521 Current tax losses not available for offset 416 147 Effect of overseas tax rates 73 532 Other 419 72 Tax expense see a above 6,764 6,060 c Factors that may affect future tax charges: The Group may claim a Schedule 23 tax credit in respect of certain share based compensation benefits.
Due to the requirements of IAS 12, in conjunction with IFRS 2, the amount of benefit that can be recognised in the income statement has been restricted in the current year and may also be restricted in future periods.
Any surplus tax credit will be recorded in equity.
There are temporary differences which arise in relation to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
Since the Group is able to control dividend distributions from these companies it is unlikely that further UK tax on repatriation of these earnings will be payable in the foreseeable future.
Consequently no deferred tax liability has been provided.
d Deferred income tax The amounts recognised and unrecognised for deferred income tax are set out below: Recognised Unrecognised Recognised Unrecognised 2010 2010 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 Depreciation in advance of capital allowances 500 - 513 - Other short-term temporary differences 6,158 - 5,604 - Tax losses 3,422 1,908 3,414 2,990 Net deferred income tax liability asset 2,236 1,908 1,677 2,990 The Group has tax losses in net terms of 1,908,000 2009: 2,990,000 that may be available for use by offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as the Group cannot foresee profitability in the companies where the losses arose with sufficient certainty.
The Group has other unrecognised tax losses amounting to 27,544,000 2009: 29,103,000.
Included within other short term temporary differences are deferred tax assets in respect of potential Schedule 23 tax benefits of 1,748,000 2009: 878,000 and a deferred tax liability in respect of the amortisation of certain intangible assets acquired, recognised in accordance with IAS 38, of 8,071,000 2009: 6,745,000.
At 31 December 2010 the net deferred income tax position is represented by a deferred income tax asset of 6,356,000 2009: 5,621,000 and a deferred income tax liability of 8,592,000 2009: 7,298,000.

The first reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted on 27 July 2010 and will be effective from 1 April 2011.
This will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recorded in the balance sheet at the rate of 27% as this is the best estimate of the rate at which they will be settled.
It has not been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 3% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the companys future current tax charge and reduce the companys deferred tax assets accordingly.
7 Earnings Per Share The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on a profit after tax of 22,044,000 2009: 17,944,000 and 77,640,587 2009: 76,200,428 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by including in the weighted average number of shares the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares related to committed share options as described in note 18.
For 2010 the diluted ordinary shares were based on 80,320,829 ordinary shares that included 2,680,242 potential weighted number of options.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 93 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued The following reflects the income and share data used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share computations: 2010 2009 000 000 Profit for the year 22,044 17,944 Amortisation of intangible fixed assets 6,587 5,808 Less: tax benefit associated with the amortisation of intangible fixed assets 1,693 1,620 Adjusted profit for the year 26,938 22,132 Adjusted earnings per share is shown as the Directors believe that earnings before amortisation is reflective of the underlying performance of the business.

Customers and intellectual property are written off on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of between 5 and 15 years.
As from 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill was no longer amortised but is now subject to annual impairment testing see note 11.

There have been no changes during 2010, with the exception of the acquisitions of Xopus BV and Language Weaver Inc group.
11 Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Intangibles With Indefinite Lives The Group has goodwill that has been acquired through business combinations but does not hold any intangible assets that have indefinite lives ascribed to them.
The approach of the Group is to test impairment at the cash generating unit level.
This is the lowest level of unit at which the group is effectively able to manage and monitor performance, cash flow and goodwill.
Four cash generating units have been determined for testing: Language Services, Language Technologies, Web Content Annual Report and Accounts 2010 97 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued Management and Structured Content Management.
Where possible the goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to these cash generating units and full attribution of overheads and group costs has been made to each of the units in testing impairment.
Language Weaver Inc. was reviewed for impairment at the date of acquisition.
In order to evaluate the recoverable amounts relating to the cash-generating units the following key information should be noted.
The recoverable amount has been determined using the detailed projections from the 2011 annual plan projected for a five year period and subsequently into perpetuity, with a discount rate applied.
Differential discount rates were used reflecting a different risk weighting based on relative maturity and size of the different cash generating units with 10.6% applied to Language Services 2009: 10.6%, 12.3% to Language Technologies 2009: 12.3%, 11.5% to Web Content management 2009: 11.5% and 11.7% to Structured Content Management 2009: 11.7%.
These reflect the relative maturity of the businesses and in aggregate approximate a group cost of capital of 11.3% for 2010 2009 11.3%.
The budget has been prepared at the cash generating unit level based on historical trends adjusted for expected events.
These individual budgets have been aggregated as the basis for the 2011 annual plan.
The discount rate has been calculated as the weighted average cost of capital.
This methodology places strong emphasis on early year cash flows in evaluating impairment.
The valuation is on a value in-use basis but has retained average perpetual growth rates from the 3.1% used in 2009.
Differential perpetual growth rates have been used reflecting the relative maturity, penetration and profile of the cash generating units with 2% applied to the Language Services business and 4% applied to the Language Technologies business, Web Content Management Business and Structured Content Management Business.
Whilst the rates of growth vary across individual cash generating units, a long term average growth rate for the 5 years pre-perpetuity of 11% has been used for the tests, when considering SDL as a whole.
Differential growth rates have been applied to the different cash-generating units according to market growth projections of 510% for Language Services, 1015% for Language Technologies and 515% for Web Content Management and Structured Content Management.
It should be noted that whilst there is increasing linkage between the cash generating units in terms of cross selling and mutual exploitation of synergy no benefits have been assumed here.
Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units: 2010 2009 000 000 Language Services 21,047 21,036 Language Technologies 64,503 45,151 Web Content Management 34,958 35,802 Structured Content Management 9,666 8,490 130,174 110,479 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Having performed its impairment tests and having analysed the various sensitivities to these tests management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the relevant units to exceed their recoverable amounts.
Next impairment test The next impairment tests will be performed at the 2011 year end.
However, management continues to monitor the performance of its cash generating units closely and should it believe a significant event has occurred which deteriorates the forward operating prospects of the business it will move to bring forward these tests.

18 Share-Based Payment Plans On 1 December 1999 the company adopted the SDL Share Option Scheme 1999.
It comprises two parts, namely the SDL Approved Share Option Scheme 1999 Approved Part and the SDL Unapproved Share Option Scheme 1999 Unapproved Part.

The Unapproved Part has not been approved by the Inland Revenue and it is not intended to apply for approval in respect of it.
On 23 April 2010, following shareholder approval, the SDL Share Option Scheme 2010 was adopted.
This scheme permits the granting of both options approved by HM Revenue and Customs within the statutory 30,000 limit and unapproved options, subject to performance conditions.
From 2010 onwards, all options will be granted in accordance with these rules.
On 27 April 2006 a long term incentive plan LTIP was formally approved by the shareholders at an EGM.
The award of any LTIP shares is made at nil costs to the directors or employees with the exception of the 1p nominal value of each share awarded at the end of a three year holding period provided stringent performance targets have been met.
These performance targets are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 62.
On 12 April 2010, 101,153 LTIP shares were granted to the Executive Directors at a market price of 4.943, with a performance period of three years from date of grant, and 469,151 and 160,010 on 12 April 2010 and 4 August 2010 respectively to certain senior management employees.
On 24 April 2008 a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme was formally approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
The scheme is open to all eligible UK employees and is linked to monthly savings contracts over a 3 year period.
Options have been granted to scheme participants at 80% of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken the day prior to the date of invitations to apply for an option.
There are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of these options.
These options may be exercised within a fixed six-month period, three years from the date of grant or being made redundant.
The expense recognised for all share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 31 December 2010 is 1,886,000 2009: 1,609,000.

104 Statutory Information 9 22 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 36 to 39.
Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is not significant in 2010 as the Group has had no borrowings during the year.
At the balance sheet date the Group retains committed facilities to the value of 20 million.
To ensure adequate working capital the Group maintains cash deposits and these deposits are affected by any movements in rates of interest generally.
These cash deposits are generally receiving interest income at LIBOR or USD, EURO equivalent plus a margin.
The Group seeks to place all cash surplus to operational requirements in secure money market funds.
To enhance the interest earning capacity of the Group, processes have been put in place to ensure that cash balances held by subsidiary companies are kept as low as operationally possible.
With regard to relative interest rates, adequate cash is retained in key operating currencies to fund the operational needs of the Group.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 percent change in the UK interest rate: 2010 2009 Profit before tax gain loss 000 000 1 % 88 104 - 1 % 88 104 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 percent change in the Euro interest rate: 2010 2009 Profit before tax gain loss 000 000 1 % 122 183 - 1 % 122 183 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 percent change in the US$ interest rate: 2010 2009 Profit before tax gain loss 000 000 1 % 119 128 - 1 % 119 128 Liquidity Risk: The Groups objective is to optimise the funds currently available to it in order to maintain the lowest operational borrowing profile necessary.
At the end of 2010 the Group had no external borrowings and approximately 46 million of net cash.
Underpinning this philosophy are processes to manage operating cash flow, with a focus on approvals policy for significant cash outlays and credit control.
Foreign Currency Risk: A significant amount of business is done with customers in both the USA and Continental Europe with approximately 44% of total invoicing done in US Dollar and 36% in Euro.
The most significant sensitivity is to the US Dollar as illustrated below.
This overseas client base gives rise to short-term debtors and cash balances in both US Dollars and Euros.
Consequently, the movements in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates affect the Group Balance Sheet, as well as the Profit and Loss Account.
The Group seeks to manage this risk in the first instance by looking to a natural hedge and ensuring where possible currency needs in the USA are funded from the settlement of US Dollar denominated debtors.
After a review of effectiveness the Group has not entered into any new US Dollar hedges since 2008.
At the end of 2010 the Board has no hedges outstanding.
In addition, the group has exposure on the Balance Sheet to the movements in US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates as a result of intangible assets held in non functional currency, the retranslation of US and Continental European overseas subsidiaries net assets into UK Sterling for consolidation purposes and finally intercompany loan and trading relationships held in non functional currency.
In the case of the latter, this can have an impact on net profitability where the intercompany relationships are not treated for accounting purposes as equity loans.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 105 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 continued The Profit and Loss is also affected by movements in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates when sales to customers are converted to Sterling at the date of the sales transaction, as this will vary from month to month.
This is partially offset by the effect of retranslating US Dollar and Euro denominated costs into UK Sterling from month to month.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 cent change in the US$ exchange rate: 2010 2009 Profit before tax gain loss 000 000 1 cent 259 221 - 1 cent 262 224 Statement of Financial Position increase decrease in net assets 1 cent 474 325 - 1 cent 480 329 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 cent change in the Euro exchange rate 2010 2009 Profit before tax gain loss 000 000 1 cent 38 77 - 1 cent 39 79 Statement of Financial Position increase decrease in net assets 1 cent 1,010 1,090 - 1 cent 1,027 1,110 Based on the Statement of Financial Position at 31 December Economic Conditions Credit Control Risk: Given the economic conditions at the end of 2010, SDL continues to benefit from a diverse list of major clients of which no client contributes more than 5% of sales.
The Group is however continuing to place emphasis on sound application of credit control processes given the recent deterioration in macro-economic conditions.
The Group has made provision against trade receivables to reflect specific collection risks identified.
Capital Management: The Group maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the business and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
The Group is at a stage where the Directors believe it is appropriate to offer a nominal yield to those investors who value income as well as capital growth and have proposed a maiden dividend.
The dividend is not intended to adjust the positioning of SDL as primarily a capital growth share.
23 Derivatives And Other Financial Instruments Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the group as at 31 December is as follows: Year ended 31 December 2010 More than Floating rate Within 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cash 46,628 - - - - - 46,628 Year ended 31 December 2009 More than Floating rate Within 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cash 46,160 - - - - - 46,160 106 Statutory Information 9 Maturity of financial liabilities The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2010: Less than Over 12 months 12 months Total 000 000 000 Other liabilities 1,224 1,370 2,594 Trade and other payables 54,631 - 54,631 55,855 1,370 57,225 The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2009: Less than Over 12 months 12 months Total 000 000 000 Other liabilities 1,102 1,882 2,984 Trade and other payables 45,504 - 45,504 46,606 1,882 48,488 Borrowing facilities The Group has one borrowing facility available to it.
At 31 December 2010 the facility available was 20 million 2009: 20 million.
The borrowing facility reduces to 15 million within one year and to 10 million within two years.
Credit risk Under the RBS facility agreement the SDL group is required to retain at least 60% of its cash held by the Group within a Charging Group defined as a list of Charging Subsidiaries and the borrower SDL plc.
This exposes the Group to counterparty risk based on the banks with whom the Charging Group holds cash deposits.
The most significant counterparty risk is with RBS.
The maximum credit risk exposure related to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value.
Fair values of assets and liabilities are based on their carrying values.
The directors consider that there were no material differences between the book values and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities at each year-end.
The fair values have been calculated using the market interest rates where applicable.
There are no hedging arrangements in place as at 31 December 2010 2009: None.
The Group had no outstanding borrowings on loan facilities that the Group held with RBS at 31 December 2010 or 2009 and therefore had no sensitivity to interest rate risk on these facilities at the balance sheet date.
The interest rates that the Group would pay under the facilities are linked directly to the 3-month LIBOR rate.
As at 31 December 2010 the Groups interest rate contract was valued at an asset of nil 2009: nil, with a loss of 73,000 being recognised in the income statement in 2009, reflecting the movement in interest rates during the year.
There was no profit or loss recognised on these contracts in 2010.
24 Events After the Statement of Financial Position Date There are no known events occurring after the statement of financial position date that require disclosure.
The Directors are recommending that a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 5.5 pence per ordinary share be paid to the shareholders whose names appear on the register at the close of business on 6 May 2011 with payment on 3 June 2011.
The Ex-dividend date will be 4 May 2011.
This recommendation will be put to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
