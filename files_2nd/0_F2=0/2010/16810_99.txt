The Company has covenanted to provide security in favour of the Trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme in respect of the funding deficit in the scheme.
The initial security takes the form of a Japanese law share pledge over 400,000 class 1 preferred shares of 200,000 in BB Mobile Corp.
The security may be replaced either on a voluntary or mandatory basis but while the security asset consists of the preferred shares, the percentage cover to the secured liabilities will be 100%.
As and when alternative security is provided, the Company has agreed that the security cover should include additional headroom of 33% but i where cash is used as the security asset the ratio will revert to 100% of the relevant liabilities and ii where the proposed replacement security asset is listed on an internationally recognised stock exchange in certain defined core jurisdictions, the Trustee may decide to agree a lower ratio than 133%.

On 29 October 2009 the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled on the plaintiffs appeal of the trial courts dismissal of all claims in the action on the basis of the federal pre-emption doctrine.
