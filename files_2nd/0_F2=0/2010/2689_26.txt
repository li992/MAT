The Interim Results contained the following statements in respect of the Cable & Wireless Group: We have updated our Group outlook for the poor economic environment in the Caribbean as well as the consolidation of Dhiraagu, our business in the Maldives, in the second half.
In May 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group set guidance at approximately US$935 million based on our planning exchange rates and the view then prevailing of the economic backdrop.
Since the summer weve seen further deterioration in Caribbean trading conditions with no immediate signs of improvement and the IMF has recently forecast GDP will decline across the region for this year and next.
Within our other markets, despite a more difficult first quarter for Panama and Macau, the second quarter showed more promise and we remain on track in Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands.
As a consequence, we are now expecting the Cable & Wireless Communications Group EBITDA for the second half to be around the same level as the first, excluding the consolidation of the Maldives, and we are revising our Cable & Wireless Communications Group 2009 10 EBITDA guidance to a range of US$880 million US$900 million, including the Maldives.
Note that the Interim Results referred to CWI rather than the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.
CWI was the holding company of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group at the date of the Interim Results.
Accordingly, on the basis of preparation and based on the principal assumptions set out below, the Cable & Wireless Communications Directors forecast that for the year ending 31 March 2010, the post-exceptional EBITDA as defined below for each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group and the Cable & Wireless Group will be as stated below: PreP&L Postexceptional exceptional exceptional EBITDA EBITDA EBITDA 1 Post-exceptional EBITDA profit forecast approximate approximate approximate US$m US$m US$m Cable & Wireless Communications Group 880-990 40 840-860 m m m Cable & Wireless Communications Group 587-600 27 560-573 Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group 430 55 375 Central operations 28 28 Cable & Wireless Group 989-1,002 82 907-920 1 B ased on an exchange rate of US$1.50:1.00.
The statements above regarding post-exceptional EBITDA and excluding demerger costs in 2009 2010 for each of Cable & Wireless Communications Group, Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group and Cable & Wireless Group represent profit forecasts under the Prospectus Rules.
The Directors have considered the above statements and continue to believe that they are valid based on the assumptions below.
The Directors do not expect the full year tax profile for each of Cable & Wireless Communications Group, Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Group to be materially different from that set out in the income statements for each of Cable & Wireless Communications Group, Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Group for the six months ended 30 September 2009.
Basis of Preparation The Directors confirm that the profit forecasts described above the Profit Forecasts have been properly compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and using accounting policies which are in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the EU and consistent with those adopted by Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable & Wireless in the preparation of the accounts.
The Profit Forecasts for Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group are based upon the unaudited consolidated results for the six months ended 30 September 2009, the results shown by unaudited management accounts for the three months ended 31 December 2009 and the Cable & Wireless Communications Directors forecast of the results for the three month period ending 31 March 2010.
The Profit Forecast for the Cable & Wireless Group is based upon the unaudited consolidated results for the six months ended 30 September 2009, the results shown by unaudited management accounts for the three months ended 31 December 2009 and the Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable & Wireless Worldwide directors forecast of the results for the three month period ending 31 March 2010.
134 C Ex 02 tra Sc et c s ti fo ro n m he ta hd e e C rable & Wireless Communications Plc Prospectus UNAUDITED The Profit Forecast for the Cable & Wireless Group has been prepared on the basis that the Cable & Wireless Group comprises the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and Central operations for the full 12 month period ending 31 March 2010.
However, the demerger is expected to complete on or about 26 March 2010.
If the demerger completes before 31 March 2010, the annual reported results of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group for the year ending 31 March 2010 will not include the trading of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group for the period following completion of the demerger and Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will be treated as a discontinued operation.
The Directors have not restated the Cable & Wireless Group Profit Forecast for the exclusion of the trading of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group for the 5 day period between the expected completion of the demerger and 31 March 2010 as they do not consider that this is material to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Profit Forecast.
Post-exceptional EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, LTIP credit charge and net other operating income expense.
The Profit Forecasts do not include any costs related to the demerger.
The Profit Forecasts are stated on the basis of the EBITDA after exceptional items rather than profit before tax due to the extent of existing guidance which has been provided to the market by Cable and Wireless plc on both EBITDA and exceptional items.
Guidance on the EBITDA performance of each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group and the Cable & Wireless Group has been provided for a number of years as it represents the measure on which management consistently assess the performance of the business and it is also the measure on which both shareholders and analysts attach greatest significance.
During the course of 2009, Cable and Wireless plc also provided guidance on the level of exceptional items in each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group and the Cable & Wireless Group.
Accordingly, the Directors consider EBITDA after exceptional items to be the most appropriate basis to present the Profit Forecasts.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Groups Profit Forecast has been prepared using the Cable & Wireless Communications Groups 2009 10 planning exchange rates, the principal rates used are: US dollar : sterling 1.5000 Sterling : US dollar 0.6667 Seychelles Rupee : US dollar 16.67 Jamaican dollar : US dollar 93.33 Euro : US dollar 0.8000 Principal assumptions The Profit Forecasts have been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions: Assumptions within the control or influence of the Directors There will be no material acquisitions and disposals during the financial year ending 31 March 2010 other than those already reported.
Assumptions outside the control or influence of the Directors The main assumptions outside the control of the Directors are: there will be no material changes to the general trading and economic conditions in each of the markets or jurisdictions in which the relevant business operates from that which is currently prevailing and or anticipated by the Directors which would cause a material change in levels of demand: there will be no material litigation or customer dispute that may arise in the period other than those that are currently prevailing and or anticipated by the Directors: there will be no change to legislation or regulatory environments in which the business operates that would materially impact on the relevant businesss operations, or its accounting policies: there will be no major disruption to the relevant business, its suppliers or customers due to natural disasters, terrorism, extreme weather conditions, industrial disruption, civil disturbance or government action: there will be no material changes in interest, inflation or exchange rates: there will be no material change in the present management or control of the relevant business or its existing operational strategy: and each relevant business will continue to enjoy the goodwill and confidence of present and potential customers, and of its strategic partners.
