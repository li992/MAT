Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 N otes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee interpretations IFRICs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS.
The principal accounting policies are described in note 2.
The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the year ended 31 December 2009 with the exception of the new standards adopted during 2010 and the presentational changes outlined below: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment amendment : IFRS 3 Business Combinations: IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement amendment : IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements: IFRIC 15 Arrangements for Construction of Real Estate: IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation: IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners: and Amendments arising from the 2008 and 2009 annual improvements project.
These either had no material impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes to presentation and disclosure only.
With effect from 1 January 2010, non-utilisation fees payable on the undrawn part of the revolving credit facilities and the amortisation of the loan arrangement costs have been reclassified into finance costs from administrative expenses.
In addition, the prepayment of the loan arrangement costs, which was previously included within trade and other receivables, has now been included as a deduction against borrowings in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
There is no impact on underlying profit, profit before tax or net assets as a result of these changes and they do not materially affect the results for the year ended 31 December 2010 or the comparative period.
Both Group trade and other receivables and borrowings have reduced by 2.6m at 31 December 2009 Company: 1.6m from those figures previously reported.
In addition, Group administrative expenses were reduced by 2.5m for the year to 31 December 2009 with a corresponding increase in total finance costs over the same periods.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations applicable to the Groups financial statements which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective at the year end.
All are deemed not relevant to the Group or to have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group when the relevant standards come into effect.
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures revised : IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation amendment : IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction amendment : IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments: Improvements to IFRSs 2010: and Deferred tax recovery of underlying assets Amendments to IAS 12.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Additional detail is provided in note 3.
103 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 2 Significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Derwent London plc and all of its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the results of its joint ventures.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences and until the date control ceases.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting as permitted by IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures, and following the procedures for this method set out in IAS 28, Investments in Associates.
The equity method requires the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the period to be presented separately in the income statement and the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture concerned.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Gross property income Gross property income arises from two main sources: i Rental income This arises from operating leases granted to tenants.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
A finance lease is one whereby substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the lessee.
Rental income is recognised in the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
This includes the effect of lease incentives given to tenants, which are normally in the form of rent free periods or capital contributions in lieu of rent free periods and the effect of payments received from tenants on the grant of leases.
For income from property leased out under a finance lease, a lease receivable asset is recognised in the balance sheet at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease, as defined in IAS 17, Leases.
Minimum lease payments receivable, again defined in IAS 17, are apportioned between finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease receivable so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the remaining net investment in the lease.
Contingent rents, being the difference between the rent currently receivable and the minimum lease payments when the net investment in the lease was originally calculated, are recognised in property income in the years in which they are receivable.
ii Surrender premiums Payments received from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Other income Other income consists of commissions and fees arising from the management of the Groups properties and is recognised in the Group income statement in accordance with the delivery of service.
Expenses i Lease payments Where investment properties are held under operating leases, the leasehold interest is classified as if it were held under a finance lease, which is recognised at its fair value on the balance sheet, within the investment property carrying value.
Upon initial recognition, a corresponding liability is included as a finance lease liability.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining finance lease liability.
Contingent rents payable, being the difference between the rent currently payable and the minimum lease payments when the lease liability was originally calculated, are charged as expenses within property expenditure in the years in which they are payable.
ii Dilapidations Dilapidations monies received from tenants in respect of their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Group income statement, unless they relate to future capital expenditure.
In the latter case, where the costs are considered to be recoverable they are capitalised as part of the carrying value of the property.
iii Reverse surrender premiums Payments made to tenants to surrender their lease obligations are charged directly to the Group income statement unless the payment is to enable the probable redevelopment of a property.
iv Other property expenditure Vacant property costs and other property costs are expensed in the year to which they relate.
104 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 Employee benefits i Share-based remuneration a Equity-settled The Company operates a long-term incentive plan and share option scheme.
The fair value of the conditional awards of shares granted under the long-term incentive plan and the options granted under the share option scheme are determined at the date of grant.
This fair value is then expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At each reporting date, the non-market based performance criteria of the long-term incentive plan are reconsidered and the expense is revised as necessary.
In respect of the share option scheme, the fair value of options granted is calculated using a binomial lattice pricing model.
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, no expense is recognised for options or conditional shares granted on or before 7 November 2002. b Cash-settled For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised based on the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date.
The movement in the current fair value is taken to the Group income statement.
ii Pensions a Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Group income statement in the period to which they relate.
b Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Any actuarial gain or loss in the period is recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Any excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and resulting deferred tax thereon is recognised as goodwill.
Any discount is credited to the Group income statement in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Any residual goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.
Investment property i Valuation Investment properties are those that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, including those that are undergoing redevelopment.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, they are carried in the Group balance sheet at fair value adjusted for the carrying value of leasehold interests and lease incentive debtors.
Fair value is the amount for which an investment property could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The valuation is undertaken by independent valuers who hold recognised and relevant professional qualifications and have recent experience in the locations and categories of properties being valued.
Surpluses or deficits resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property are reported in the Group income statement in the year in which they arise.
ii Capital expenditure Capital expenditure, being costs directly attributable to the redevelopment or refurbishment of an investment property, up to the point of it being completed for its intended use, are capitalised in the carrying value of that property.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to such expenditure are expensed in the year in which they arise.
iii Disposal The disposal of investment properties is accounted for on completion of contract.
On disposal, any gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value at the last year end plus subsequent capitalised expenditure during the year.
Where the net disposal proceeds have yet to be finalised at the balance sheet date, the proceeds recognised reflect the Directors best estimate of the amounts expected to be received.
iv Development When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued use as an investment property or acquires a property with the subsequent intention of developing as an investment property, the property is classified as an investment property and is accounted for as such.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sale, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset.
The property is remeasured to fair value as at the date of transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement.
The remeasured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, is depreciated at a rate of between 10% and 25% per annum which is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of the individual assets, over their expected useful lives.
Investments Investments in joint ventures, being those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, as established by contractual agreement, are included in the Groups balance sheet at cost together with the Groups share of post-acquisition reserves, on a net equity basis.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are included in the Companys balance sheet at the lower of cost and their net asset value.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
105 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 2 Significant accounting policies continued Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met if the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, being actively marketed and management is committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets, including related liabilities, classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs of disposal.
Trading properties Trading properties include those properties which were acquired exclusively with a view to resale or development and resale and are held at the lower of cost or transfer value and net realisable value.
Financial assets i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and on-demand deposits less overdrafts.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
ii Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value.
A provision for impairment is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
Financial liabilities i Bank loans and overdrafts Bank loans and overdrafts are included as financial liabilities on the balance sheets at the amounts drawn on the particular facilities.
Interest payable is expensed as a finance cost in the year to which it relates.
ii Bonds These are included as a financial liability on the balance sheet net of the unamortised discount and costs on issue.
The difference between this carrying value and the redemption value is recognised in the Group income statement over the life of the bond on an effective interest basis.
Interest payable to bond holders is expensed in the year to which it relates.
iii Finance lease liabilities Finance lease liabilities arise for those investment properties held under a leasehold interest and accounted for as investment property.
The liability is initially calculated as the present value of the minimum lease payments, reducing in subsequent years by the apportionment of payments to the lessor, as described above under the heading for lease payments.
iv Interest rate derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with the financing of the Groups business.
No trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
At each reporting date, these interest rate derivatives are measured at fair value, being the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit rating of the counterparties.
The gain or loss at each fair value remeasurement is recognised in the Group income statement.
v Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the tax computations, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
In respect of the deferred tax on the revaluation surplus, this is calculated on the basis of the chargeable gains that would crystallise on the sale of the investment portfolio as at the reporting date.
The calculation takes account of available indexation on the historic cost of the properties and any available capital losses.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period, based on Acts substantially enacted at the year end, when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is included in profit or loss for the period, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Dividends Dividends payable on the ordinary share capital are recognised in the year in which they are declared.
Foreign currency translation On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statement and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of long-term monetary items forming part of the Groups net investment in foreign entities are recognised in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
Transactions entered into by Group entities in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction dates.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Group income statement.
106 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 3 Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are stated in note 2 above.
Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
The following is intended to provide an understanding of the policies that management consider critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Trade receivables The Group is required to judge when there is sufficient objective evidence to require the impairment of individual trade receivables.
It does this on the basis of the age of the relevant receivables, external evidence of the credit status of the debtor entity and the status of any disputed amounts.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as those items which are sufficiently material by either their size or nature as to require separate disclosure.
Deciding which items meet this definition requires the Group to exercise its judgement.
Estimated compulsory purchase proceeds During 2009, compulsory purchase orders issued under the Crossrail Act 2008 were received in relation to three of the Groups investment properties.
At 31 December 2009, the proceeds recognised in respect of these properties were the Directors best estimates of the amounts to be received.
These transactions, and, as a result, the total proceeds, were finalised during 2010 and the difference between the final proceeds and the estimates made at the 2009 year end have been recognised in the Group income statement.
Investment property valuation The Group uses the valuation carried out by its independent valuers as the fair value of its investment properties.
The valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, future development costs and the appropriate discount rate.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
Outstanding rent reviews Where the rent review date has passed, and the revised annual rent has not been agreed, rent is accrued from the date of the rent review based upon an estimated annual rent.
The estimate is derived from knowledge of market rents for comparable properties.
Compliance with the real estate investment trust taxation REIT regime On 1 July 2007 the Group converted to a REIT.
In order to achieve and retain REIT status, several entrance tests had to be met and certain ongoing criteria must be maintained.
The main criteria are as follows: at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Groups assets: at least 75% of the Groups total profits must arise from the tax exempt business: and at least 90% of the tax exempt business must be distributed.
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary differences relating to the property rental business which is within the REIT structure.
4 Segmental information IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal financial reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker which in the Groups case is its executive Board comprising the six executive Directors in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The internal financial reports received by the Groups executive Board contain financial information at a Group level as a whole and there are no reconciling items between the results contained in these reports and the amounts reported in the financial statements.
These internal financial reports include the IFRS figures but also report the non-IFRS figures for the adjusted earnings per share, net asset value and profit figures.
Reconciliations of each of these figures to their statutory equivalents are detailed in note 16.
Additionally, information is provided to the executive Board showing gross property income and investment property valuation by individual property.
Therefore, for the purposes of IFRS 8, each individual property is considered to be a separate operating segment in that its performance is monitored individually.
The Groups investment property portfolio comprises 90% office buildings by value.
The Directors consider that these properties have similar types of tenants: they demonstrate similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics.
Therefore, these individual properties have been aggregated into a single operating segment.
The remaining 10% represents a mixture of retail, hotel, residential and light industrial properties, as well as land, each of which is fide minimis in its own right.
Accordingly, the Directors are of the view that it is appropriate to disclose two reportable segments, office buildings and other, by reference to gross property income and investment property value.
Some office buildings have an ancillary element such as retail or residential.

All of the Groups investment properties are based in the UK.
The Group also has a joint venture in Prague which represents 0.2% of the Groups assets see note 19.
No geographical grouping is contained in any of the internal financial reports provided to the Groups executive Board.
Therefore, no geographical segmental analysis is required by IFRS 8.
However, the following analysis is included to provide users with additional information regarding the geographical areas contained in the business review.
The balance of 118.7m 2009: 123.7m is derived solely from rental income from the Groups properties.
Of these amounts, 1.0m 2009: 4.2m was derived from a lease to BT of the Angel Building, EC1, where in March 2007, the Group entered into an arrangement with BT to restructure the lease arrangements such that the Group could obtain possession of the building whilst maintaining rental income from BT until March 2010 albeit that, if the Group disposed of this property, the right to that rental income would pass to the purchaser.
The Group has included the income from this building within gross property income as, although similar to a lease surrender arrangement, the Groups entitlement to this rental income is linked to its continued ownership of the property rather than being an unconditional amount receivable whether as an upfront payment or through a series of instalments.
Other income of 1.7m 2009: 1.5m relates to fees and commissions earned in relation to the management of the Groups properties and is recognised in the Group income statement in accordance with the delivery of services.

The foreign exchange loss of 0.2m 2009: 3.6m gain resulted from the translation of an intercompany loan from a non-trading US subsidiary.
The impact on net asset value from this exchange movement is minimal as there is an offsetting entry in equity see Group statement of comprehensive income.
Other finance income includes 0.8m 2009: nil received as a contribution towards the costs of arranging alternative financing upon the early repayment of a banking facility.
In accordance with IAS 39, this amount was credited to the income statement.

These are an expense of 2.6m 2009: 2.0m and a credit of 0.1m 2009: 1.6m charge relating to equity-settled and cash-settled share options respectively.
Details of the Directors remuneration awards under the long-term incentive plan and options held by the Directors under the Group share option schemes are given in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 82 to 91.

All were employed in administrative roles.
13 Share-based payments Details of the options held by Directors and employees under the Groups share option schemes are given in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 82 to 91.
Group and Company equity-settled option scheme The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of options granted during the year under the equity-settled option scheme operated by the Group.
This scheme is separate to the performance share plan and other option schemes as disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 82 to 91.
The Directors are not entitled to any awards under this scheme.
2010 2009 Option pricing model used Binomial lattice Binomial lattice Share price at date of grant 13.20 6.10 Exercise price 13.20 6.10 Number granted 58,500 69,500 Number lapsed 2,500 10,000 Contractual life 10 years 10 years Risk free interest rate 3.4% 2.7% Volatility 40.0% 37.0% Dividend yield 2.0% 4.0% For both the 2010 and 2009 grants, additional assumptions have been made that there is no employee turnover and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 20% in the money and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 100% in the money.
The volatility assumption, measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is based on a statistical analysis of daily prices over the last three years.
110 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 13 Share-based payments continued Group cash-settled option scheme All options relating to the cash-settled option scheme arose as a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc.
A binomial lattice pricing model was used to value the cash-settled options.
The closing share price at 31 December 2010 of 15.61 2009: 13.20 and a dividend yield of 1.8% 2009: 1.9% were used together with risk-free interest rates of between 0.5% and 1.3% 2009: between 0.5% and 2.3% depending on the term of the options.
Due to the small number of individuals who have been granted these options, an assumption of zero employee turnover has been made.
Additionally, volatilities of 21% pa, 44% pa and 46% pa 2009: 58% pa, 49% pa and 40% pa have been used.
In general, the value of an option is affected by how quickly employees are assumed to exercise their awards after vesting.
In this case, however, given the other assumptions, the share price at 31 December 2010, and the fact that the expected lives of the options are relatively short, the fair values are not sensitive to this assumption.
It has been assumed that employees try to maximise their returns and therefore do not exercise their options immediately, but tend to exercise their options later at the financially optimal date.
14 Pension costs The Group and Company operate a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme.
The latter was acquired as part of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc in 2007 and is closed to new members.
All new employees will join the defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group companies.
Defined contribution plan The total expense relating to this plan in the current year was 1.1m 2009: 0.9m.
Defined benefit plan The defined benefit scheme, which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Managed Fund Policy with Ignis Asset Management and F&C Investments plus annuity policies held in the name of the Trustees.
The pension charge for the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.

The Companys accounting policy is to carry investments in subsidiary undertakings at the lower of cost and net asset value and recognise any impairment, or reversal thereof, in the income statement.
In the opinion of the Directors, the most appropriate estimate of the recoverable amount is the net asset value of the subsidiaries.
In view of the valuation movement relating to the investment properties, there has been an increase in the net asset value of the subsidiaries 2009: reduction which has been reflected as an impairment reversal, though not as to exceed the initial cost net of dividends, in the Company income statement of 142.8m 2009: 49.0m impairment charge.
Of this amount, 142.8m 2009: 45.0m relates to the investment in London Merchant Securities Ltd.
There is a reserve transfer from retained earnings to the merger reserve within other reserves upon an impairment or an impairment reversal.
In the prior year, the remaining 4.1m relates to two of the Companys other investments and remains within retained earnings.
The Company liquidated its investment in Bramley Road Ltd during the prior year.
The investment was being carried at 6.2m and made a loss on liquidation of 3.5m.
During the prior year, the Company became the direct beneficial owner of the shares in LMS Kingston Ltd, an indirect subsidiary Company, for nil consideration.
These shares were sold to a third party realising net proceeds of 1.0m and a profit on disposal of 0.6m.
The Company increased its investment in two of its subsidiaries during the prior year: Derwent Valley West End Ltd by 2.0m and Derwent Valley Property Trading Ltd by 2.1m, as these entities were in a net liability position.
In accordance with IAS 36, these investments were written down to their net asset value.

The eventual liability to national insurance is dependent on: the market price of the Companys shares at the date of exercise: the number of equity instruments that are exercised: and the prevailing rate of national insurance at the date of exercise.
The onerous contract relates to the excess of rent payable over rent receivable on a lease at the Groups previous head office which expires in 2014 and reflects the discounted present value of future net payments under that lease.
A provision is made for the potential liability for cash-settled share options based on the valuation carried out at each balance sheet date see note 13.
In addition, the bonds are secured by a floating charge over a number of the Groups subsidiary companies which contain 436.6m 2009: 339.1m of the Groups properties.
At 31 December 2010, 750.8m 2009: 738.7m of the Groups properties were subject to a fixed charge to secure the Companys bank loans.
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosure, requires disclosure of the maturity of the Groups and Companys remaining contractual financial liabilities.
The tables below show the anticipated undiscounted cash outflows arising from the Groups gross debt.
Secured Bonds 2026 As a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc in 2007, the Secured Bonds 2026 were included at fair value less issue costs.
This difference between fair value and principal value is being amortised through the income statement.
The fair value shown in note 26 was determined by the mid-price of 109 per 100 as at 31 December 2010 2009: 101 per 100.
Hedged debt The hedged debt consists of interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps represents the net present value of the difference between the contracted fixed rates and the fixed rates payable if the swaps were to be replaced on 31 December 2010 for the period to the contracted expiry dates.
The fair value of the interest rate cap represents the net cost of replacement on identical terms at prices prevailing on 31 December 2010.

There have been no transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2010 or 2009.
Financial instruments risk management The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks: credit risk: fair value or cash flow interest rate risk: and liquidity risk.
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
The following describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
Further information on risk as required by IFRS 7 is given on pages 19 to 21 and page 76.
There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods.
The Company has the same risk profile as the Group except tenant credit risk, which does not exist in the Company and therefore no separate analysis has been provided in relation to the Company.
126 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 26 Financial assets and liabilities continued Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are trade receivables, cash at bank, bank overdraft, trade and other payables, floating rate bank loans, Secured Bonds, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
General objectives, policies and processes The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to executive management.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups flexibility and its ability to maximise returns.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from its lease contracts.
It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new tenants before entering into contracts.
The Board has established a credit committee which assesses each new tenant before a new lease is signed.
The review includes the latest sets of financial statements, external ratings, when available, and, in some cases, forecast information and bank and trade references.
The covenant strength of each tenant is determined based on this review and, if appropriate, a deposit or a guarantee is obtained.
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk.
However, this is mitigated by the wide range of tenants from a broad spectrum of business sectors.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating of investment grade are accepted.
This risk is also reduced by the short periods that money is on deposit at any one time.
The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk.
The quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to trade and other receivables which are neither past due nor impaired are disclosed in note 22.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates interest rate risk.
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from borrowings at variable rates.
It is currently Group policy that between 60% and 85% of external Group borrowings excluding finance lease payables are at fixed rates.
Where the Group wishes to vary the amount of external fixed rate debt it holds subject to it being at least 60% and no more than 85% of expected Group borrowings, as noted above, the Group makes use of interest rate derivatives to achieve the desired interest rate profile.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
During both 2010 and 2009, the Groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling.
The Group monitors the interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to ascertain the impact on profit or loss and net assets of a 50 basis point shift in interest rates and this would result in an increase of 1.3m 2009: 0.7m or a decrease of 1.3m 2009: 0.7m.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps quantitative disclosures are given in note 25.
The Group generally raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient headroom in its loan facilities to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.
To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain committed facilities to meet the expected requirements.
The Group also seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates and hence cash flows on a portion of its long-term borrowings.
This is further explained in the fair value and cash flow interest rate risk section above.
The executive management receives rolling three-month cash flow projections on a monthly basis and three-year projections of loan balances on a regular basis as part of the Groups forecasting processes.
At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.
The Groups loan facilities are spread across a range of UK and European banks so as to minimise any potential concentration of risk.
The liquidity risk of the Group is managed centrally by the finance department.
127 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 26 Financial assets and liabilities continued Capital disclosures The Groups capital comprises all components of equity share capital, share premium, other reserves, retained earnings and minority interest.
The Groups objectives when maintaining capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders: and to provide an above average annualised total return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in its industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of balance sheet gearing and the loan to value ratio.
During 2010, the Groups strategy, which was unchanged from 2009, was to maintain the balance sheet gearing below 80% in normal circumstances.
The three gearing ratios are defined on page 135 and are derived below.
Balance sheet gearing 2010 2009 m m 1 Total net borrowings and derivatives 920.4 762.8 Less: derivative financial instruments 25.4 23.0 Total debt 895.0 739.8 Less: cash and cash equivalents 7.2 19.0 Net debt 887.8 720.8 Net assets 1,494.7 1,163.9 Balance sheet gearing 59.4% 61.9% Loan to value ratio 2010 2009 m m Net debt 887.8 720.8 Loan arrangement costs and fair value adjustment to Secured Bonds 17.9 18.6 Fair value adjustment to Secured Bonds 4.4 2.6 Leasehold liabilities 7.4 7.4 Drawn facilities 866.9 697.4 Fair value of investment property 2,426.1 1,918.4 Loan to value ratio 35.7% 36.4% Interest cover ratio 2010 2009 m m Gross property income 119.4 123.8 Surrender premiums 0.7 0.1 Ground rent 0.8 1.3 Net rental income 117.9 122.4 Net finance costs 37.9 35.9 Foreign exchange loss gain 0.2 3.6 Net pension return 0.3 0.1 Finance lease cost 0.5 0.6 Amortisation of fair value adjustment to Secured Bonds and loan arrangement costs 0.2 0.7 Non-utilisation fees 1.4 1.2 Net interest payable 35.9 37.1 Interest cover ratio 328% 330% 1 T he comparative figures have been restated for the presentational changes as outlined in note 1.

Deferred tax on the revaluation surplus is calculated on the basis of the chargeable gains that would crystallise on the sale of the investment property portfolio as at each balance sheet date.
The Finance No 2 Act 2010 included provision for legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28.0% to 27.0% from 1 April 2011.
The effect of this reduction was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, has been reflected in these financial statements.
28 Equity The authorised share capital was 6.04m at 1 January 2009, 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010.
The number of 5p ordinary shares in issue at the year end was 101,200,297 2009: 100,950,263.
During the year, 211,000 shares 2009: 105,250 were issued as a result of the exercise of share options which realised proceeds of 1.3m 2009: 0.7m and 39,034 shares 2009: 37,867 were issued as a result of awards vesting under the Groups performance share plan.

Previously, the total return measure was based on the undiluted adjusted net asset value per share.
Based on this method of calculation, total return would have been 29.4% for the year ended 31 December 2010 compared with the previously reported figure of 2.7 % for 2009.
34 Capital commitments Contracts for capital expenditure entered into by the Group at 31 December 2010 and not provided for in the accounts amounted to 11.6m 2009: 31.4m.
These contracts relate wholly to the construction, development or enhancement of the Groups investment properties.
At 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009, there were no obligations for the purchase, repair or maintenance of investment properties.
130 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 35 Contingent liabilities The Company and its subsidiaries are party to cross guarantees securing the overdraft and certain bank loans.
At 31 December 2010 the maximum liability that could arise for the Company from the cross guarantees amounted to 5.4m 2009: 0.4m.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
36 Post balance sheet events Since the year end, the Group has exchanged contracts for the purchase of two freehold properties for 45.0m and 31.0m, before costs.

These vary dependent on the individual tenant and the respective property and demise but typically are let for a term of five to 15 years, at a market rent with provisions to review to market rent every five years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments and recovery of other direct costs.
The weighted average lease length of the leases granted during 2010 was 8.4 years 2009: 8.9 years.
Of these leases, 47% 2009: 46% included a rent free period at the start of the lease, the weighted average being 8.6 months 2009: 5.0 months.
