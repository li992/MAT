a Description of the plans The Group maintains a number of active share option and award plans and schemes the Groups Share Plans.
These are as follows: i Savings-related options These are options granted under the HM Revenue and Customs-approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option schemes in the UK and Irish Revenue-approved SAYE share option scheme in Ireland.
Options are normally exercisable during the six-month period following either the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the start of the relevant savings contract.
ii Executive share options These are options granted on various dates until 2004, under the Aviva Executive Share Option Plan or predecessor plans, and in 2010, under the Aviva Executive Share Option Plan 2005.
Options granted between 2001 and 2004 were subject to the satisfaction of conditions relating to both the Companys Return on Capital Employed ROCE and its relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
The performance was measured over a three-year performance period and the options are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their grant.
The options granted in 2010 are described in the Directors Remuneration Report.

Shares which do not vest, lapse.
iii Shares to satisfy awards and options Prior to March 2003, it was the practice to satisfy awards and options granted under the Groups Share Plans through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts which were established for the purpose of satisfying awards under the Groups Share Plans and funded by the Company.
From March 2003 to July 2008, it was generally the Companys practice to satisfy the awards granted after March 2003 by the issue of new shares at the time of vesting.
However, since July 2008, it has been the Companys practice to satisfy all awards and options using shares purchased in the market and held by employee trusts except where local regulations make it necessary to issue new shares.
Further details are given in note 31.
