Two Drivers of Value Future value will be driven by the actions we are taking to benefit from the economic recovery and from our strategic investments 2.1 ECONOMIC RECOVERy Significant elements of the business are subject to the economic cycle and we have experienced a downturn during the recent worldwide recession.
Due to the relatively high margins on incremental volumes, higher activity levels associated with the economic recovery will benefit the business significantly.
This potential benefit has been enhanced by the further actions we have been taking to reduce the cost base.
2.2 STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS As outlined in the next section, our strategy is to focus on three growth areas.
To increase the rate of success in these areas we are undergoing a programme of significant strategic investments in each area.
These investments, which we have continued to make during the recession, are outlined in the Chief Executives Statement.
We are targeting a 15% return on our investments.
