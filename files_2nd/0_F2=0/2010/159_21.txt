Reserves and resources Mineral reserves and mineral resources estimates contained in this An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for report have been calculated as at 31 December 2010 in accordance which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of with National Instrument 43-101 as required by Canadian securities geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, regulatory authorities, unless otherwise stated.

The estimate is Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum CIM definitions were followed based on limited information and sampling gathered through for mineral reserves and resources.
Calculations have been reviewed, appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, verified including estimation methodology, sampling, analytical and pits, workings and drill holes.

The estimate is based on detailed Mineral reserves have been calculated using an assumed long-term and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through average gold price of US$1,000.00 per ounce, a silver price of appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, US$16.00 per ounce and a copper price of US$2.00 per pound.

Mineral resources have been calculated A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for using an assumed long-term average gold price of US$1,200.00 per which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical ounce, a silver price of US$19.00 per ounce and a copper price of characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with US$2.50 per pound.
Resources have been estimated using varying cutconfidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical off grades, depending on the type of mine or project, its maturity and and economic parameters, to support production planning and ore types at each property.
Reserve estimates are dynamic and are evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.
The estimate is influenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues, based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing environmental regulations and any other relevant new information information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations and therefore these can vary from year to year.
Resource estimates such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are can also change and tend to be influenced mostly by new information spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.

In addition, estimates of inferred mineral Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have resources may not form the basis of an economic analysis and it demonstrated economic viability.

Therefore, investors are A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary resource exists, that it can be economically or legally mined, or that feasibility study.

The Nyanzaga mineral reserves and mineral resources estimates A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an contained in this report are based on the inferred resource declaration indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource made by Tusker Gold Limited in June 2009, which was calculated in demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study.

Definitions A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilised organic measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial feasibility study.
This study must include adequate information on minerals in or on the Earths crust in such form and quantity and of mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction.

Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories.
