Property charges comprise onerous lease costs and charges related to vacating properties.
Asset impairments, which are mainly in respect of the reformatting of the UK store portfolio, relate to intangible assets and items of property, plant & equipment which are to be eliminated from the business over a shorter period than their current useful expected lives and in addition for 2008 09, inventories.
Impairments of intangible assets and property, plant & equipment comprise a combination of asset write offs and incremental accelerated depreciation charges associated with the economic useful life of these assets being shortened and for which incremental charges of 5 million 2008 09 5 million are expected to be incurred, spread over the next three financial periods.

vi Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: Items excluded from underlying finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on an accruals basis the basis upon which all other items in the financial statements are prepared.
Also included within this amount are remeasurement losses relating to put options predominantly held by minority shareholders.
Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.
Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors view also conflict with both the commercial reasons for entering into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement in the majority of cases would amount to speculative use of derivatives.
vii 2008 09: On 4 June 2009, following an agreement in principle in April 2009, the Group agreed a settlement with HMRC in respect of a dispute concerning certain historical intra group trading arrangements in the years 1997 to 2005 as well as certain other matters.
The settlement exceeded the provision already held in the balance sheet and accordingly a non-underlying income tax charge of 52.7 million was recorded in current tax.
This charge was in addition to the tax effects applied to the net non-underlying charges before tax and was treated as non-underlying owing to its size and one-off non-recurring nature.

The Group has provided deferred tax of nil 2008 09 0.8 million in relation to temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and the income tax consequences of paying dividends.
In all other cases, the Group has determined that the undistributed profits of its overseas subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax which has not been recognised for the taxes which would be payable on the undistributed earnings of the Groups investment in subsidiaries is nil 2008 09 27.8 million.
As a result of share disposals, allowable losses have been incurred which are available for offset against certain future chargeable gains.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is considered that there is insufficient evidence that chargeable gains will arise.

As required by IFRS 3, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
These reviews are carried out using the following criteria.
An amount of goodwill is attributed to each specific acquisition.
Such acquisitions are determined to be a Cash Generating Unit CGU as determined by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on calculating its value in use.
The value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements own projections covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to the relevant markets Gross Domestic Product GDP.
The value in use is compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
The impairment charge in 2008 09 related to Markantalo.
The most significant components of goodwill relate to Elkjp Nordic AS Elkjp, UniEuro S. p. A. UniEuro and PIXmania S. A. S. PIXmania.
In addition to managements five year projections, the key assumptions used in calculating value in use as well as the carrying values are: 2010 2009 Key assumptions for 2010 Key assumptions for 2009 Growth rate Pre-tax risk Net book Growth rate Pre-tax risk Net book beyond adjusted value beyond adjusted value five years discount rate million five years discount rate million Elkjp 3.0% 10.9% 667.4 3.0% 11.0% 610.8 UniEuro 1.0% 12.3% 144.3 1.2% 12.3% 147.3 PIXmania 1.8% 13.0% 181.7 2.1% 13.2% 185.6 The growth rate beyond five years is based on GDP for the territories in which these businesses operate.
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital with a risk premium reflecting the relative risks in the markets in which the businesses operate.
The five year projections, which have been approved by management, have been prepared using strategic plans which incorporate the relative performance of competitors and knowledge of the current market together with managements views on the future achievable growth in market share, impact of the Renewal and Transformation plan and profitability over the longer term.
In forming these views, management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance.
Key assumptions used in determining the forecasts comprise sales, costs and margins.
Historical amounts for both the businesses under impairment review as well as from other parts of the Group are used to generate the values attributed to these assumptions.
Achievable growth in market share takes into account the anticipated success of store offerings versus competitors as well as internal and external competitor intelligence.
Sensitivities A sensitivity analysis had been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other variables held constant.
The directors have concluded that in the case of Elkjp there are no reasonably possible changes in any key assumption which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
In the case of UniEuro and PIXmania, it is reasonably possible that a change in a key assumption could occur and accordingly the following sensitivities are presented.
88 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders UniEuro In respect of managements five year projections, a decrease of 7.9% in operating profit in year five, whilst maintaining other elements of the five year projections, would cause the current headroom of 13.1 million in the value in use over the net book value of the goodwill to erode to nil.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 1.9% or an increase in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate of 0.6% would cause the headroom in the value in use over the net book value of the goodwill to erode to nil.
PIXmania In respect of managements five year projections, a decrease of 13.3% in operating profit in year five, whilst maintaining other elements of the five year projections, would cause the current headroom of 30.0 million in the value in use over the net book value of the goodwill to erode to nil.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 1.8% or an increase in the pre-tax adjusted discount rate of 1.1% would cause the headroom in the value in use over the net book value of the goodwill to erode to nil.
Amortisation of intangibles relates to continuing operations 2008 09 28.9 million and 0.2 million relating to continuing and discontinued operations, respectively.
For 2008 09, non-underlying impairment of acquired intangibles relates to the Markantalo brand as shown in note 4.
Included within the carrying amount of brand names are 35.4 million and 17.0 million 2009 39.4 million and 18.0 million relating to the euro denominated PIXmania and Kotsovolos brand names, respectively and for which the remaining life of these assets is 11 years and 24 years, respectively.

The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordic region, the Group operates two funded secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to a state pension scheme.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 1.0 million 2008 09 0.9 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period, actuarial gains losses and currency retranslation.
In other territories, the Group also provides other post-employment benefits which are largely governed by statute, in particular in Italy and Greece.
a Defined contribution pension schemes The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was 5.5 million 2008 09 5.4 million.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 95 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21 Retirement and other post-employment benefit obligations continued b UK Defined benefit pension scheme actuarial valuation and assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 5 April 2007 using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
A further actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2010 is currently underway, however, results are not expected to be available until early in 2011 12.
The Groups contribution rate for 2009 10, agreed in consultation with the trustees actuaries, was 12.4% per annum of pensionable salaries 2008 09 12.5% with the reduction representing a change in the mix of contributions between different sections of the scheme.
A recovery plan has been agreed with the trustees of the scheme whereby the Company makes twice yearly contributions of 6.0 million which commenced in June 2008 and end in December 2012.
Since April 2007, the scheme has operated on a career average revalued earnings arrangement where benefits are earned for each year of pensionable service as opposed to being calculated with reference to salary near to date of retirement.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 5 April 2007 used for determining costs and contributions were: Rate per annum Discount rate for accrued benefits Pre-retirement 6.6% Post-retirement 5.2% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries Up to April 2010 3.5% Thereafter 4.5% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 3.0% Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.5% 3.75% Inflation 3.0% Expected return on assets 6.5% At 5 April 2007, the market value of the schemes investments was 688 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 92% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The value of liabilities exceeded assets by 61.0 million.
c UK Defined benefit pension scheme IAS 19 The following summarises the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement, the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
i Principal assumptions adopted The assumptions used in calculating the expenses and obligations are set by the directors after consultation with the independent actuaries.
Rates per annum 2010 2009 Discount rate 5.5% 6.7% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.6% 3.8% 4.3% Rate of increase in pensions in payment pre post April 2006 accrual 3.5% 2.3% 3.3% 2.5% Inflation 3.6% 3.3% 3.8% up to April 2010 and 4.3% thereafter.
The Group uses certain demographic assumptions when calculating scheme obligations which are those underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 5 April 2007.
In particular, post-retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard tables PA92 projected to calendar year 2008 in line with the medium cohort factors set out in CMI working paper 1: interim basis for adjusting the 92 series mortality projections for cohort effects, with an allowance for future mortality improvement in line with medium cohort projection factors.
Such tables represent an average expected longevity of between 87.1 years and 87.9 years for men and between 90 years and 90.7 years for women 2009 87 years for men and 89.9 years for women for those becoming 65 at the measurement date and an extra one year of longevity for both men and women becoming 65 in 15 years time.
96 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders ii Amounts recognised in consolidated income statement 2009 10 2008 09 million million Current service cost charged to underlying operating profit 4.7 6.3 Non-underlying curtailment 33.4 Total operating credit charge 28.7 6.3 Expected return on plan assets 37.6 47.8 Interest cost on benefit obligations 45.6 47.2 Net other finance costs income 8.0 0.6 Total credited charged to profit before tax 20.7 5.7 Other than the payments under the recovery plan, the Group does not expect to make any further contributions to its UK defined benefit pension scheme in 2010 11.
The curtailment arises from the closure to future accrual of the scheme which occurred on 30 April 2010.
The effect of the closure has meant that all active members of the scheme have now become treated as deferred members.
The effect of the closure is that these members are no longer entitled to future salary increases other than in line with inflation.
This amounts to a change in benefits accruing to these members and results in a one-off reduction in the ultimate liabilities in respect of these individuals.

Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the 2010 11 income statement and the balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.

98 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders 22 Financial instruments a Financial risk management objectives and policies Treasury operations are managed centrally within policies approved by the Board and are subject to periodic independent internal and external reviews.
Group Treasury reports regularly to the Audit Committee and the Tax & Treasury Committee.
The major treasury risks to which the Group is exposed relate to market risks movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Areas where risks are most likely to occur are evaluated regularly.
The Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks in accordance with defined policies.
Throughout the period under review, in accordance with Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or other instruments was permitted.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 1.16.
Exchange rate risk The Group is exposed to exchange movements on recognised assets and liabilities, overseas earnings and translated values of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Groups principal translation currency exposures are the euro and Norwegian krone.
Taking into account the cost of hedging, the Groups policy is to match, in whole or in part, currency earnings with related currency costs and currency assets with currency liabilities through the use of appropriate hedging instruments.
The Group is also exposed to certain transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from purchases in currencies other than in the functional currency of the entity.
The Groups principal transactional currency exposures are the US dollar and euro.
It is Group policy to minimise the currency exposures on such purchases through the use of appropriate hedging instruments such as forward exchange contracts.
Such contracts are designed to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
Interest rate risk The principal interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect of sterling cash, investments and borrowings, hedged internal Norwegian krone liabilities and euro borrowings.
Potential exposure to interest rate movements is mitigated by the Groups policy to match to the extent possible the profile of interest payments with that of its interest receipts.
Taking into account the cost of hedging, further mitigation is achieved with interest based credit commissions received and through the use of interest based hedging instruments.
Such matching is evaluated regularly to ensure that risks are minimised.
Liquidity risk It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings, committed bank and other facilities sufficient to meet anticipated short term and long term financial requirements.
In applying this policy the Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cash flows against the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Uncommitted facilities are also maintained and used if available on advantageous terms.
It is Group Treasury policy to ensure that a specific level of committed facilities is always available based on forecast working capital requirements.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced and are stress tested for different scenarios including, but not limited to, reasonably possible decreases in profit margins and increases in interest rates on the Groups borrowing facilities and the weakening of sterling against other functional currencies within the Group.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk on liquid funds, investments mainly bank deposits and floating rate notes and derivative financial instruments arises from the risk of non-performance of counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the book value of these assets.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through application of Group Treasury policy which restricts counterparties to those with a minimum Moodys long term credit rating of Aa3, bank financial strength rating of C and short term credit rating of P1.
The Group also has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any single financial institution.
The Group continuously reviews the credit quality of counterparties, the limits placed on individual credit exposures and categories of investments.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk given the policies in place.
The Groups receivable balances comprise a large number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Concentration of risk is therefore limited and maximum exposure is equal to the book value of receivables.
Sales to retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major credit cards.
It is Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
New credit customers are assessed using an external rating report which is used to establish a credit limit.
Such limits are reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis, for example, when a customer wishes to place an order in excess of their existing credit limit.
Receivable balances are monitored regularly with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Management therefore believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 99 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Capital risk management It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.
The Group is subject to certain externally imposed capital requirements in the form of banking covenants involving borrowing ratios which it met throughout the period.
The Board has delegated responsibility for routine capital expenditure to a Capital Committee, which has approval responsibility for: Group long term and budgeted capital spend, setting capital assessment criteria, new store capital approval, subsidiary company funding, business acquisitions, business disposals and contingent liabilities such as guarantees.
The Committee also approves routine statutory and internal delegated powers of authority in relation to capital expenditure.
The Group considers the manner in which funds are distributed to shareholders by assessing the performance of the business, the level of available net funds and the short to medium term strategic plans concerning future capital spend as well as the need to meet banking covenants and borrowing ratios.
Such assessment will influence the level of dividends payable as well as consideration from time to time of market purchases of the Groups own shares.
The Group monitors available net funds on a regular basis and this is affected by Free Cash Flow, one of the Groups key performance indicators as defined further in the Strategic Summary section of the Directors Report b Fair values of financial assets and liabilities For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in notes 14 and 19, respectively.
The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15.
For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in note 22 d. The fair value of the Bonds is 297.0 million 2009 216.1 million.
The Bonds are carried at amortised cost, plus a fair value adjustment, as a result of the fair value hedge discussed below.
Excluded from the fair value is 8.4 million 2009 8.4 million of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.
Fair value of derivatives is predominantly determined using observable market data such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
As such, derivatives are classified as Level 2 under the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.

100 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders c Hedging activities The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies by entering predominantly into forward foreign exchange currency contracts.
It also uses swaps and options to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange translation exposure.
At 1 May 2010 the Group had interest rate swaps in place for the Bonds with a notional amount of 250 million 2009 300 million whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and pays a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR.
In order to provide a hedge against certain euro denominated fixed asset investments and to finance working capital 200 million 2009 250 million has been swapped into floating rate euro borrowings bearing interest based on EURIBOR.
The Group designates financial instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows: Cash flow hedges At 1 May 2010 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of 435.6 million 2009 72.7 million that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
These contracts are expected to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
The fair value of these currency derivatives which have been deferred in equity amounts to a 7.0 million loss 2008 09 0.2 million gain.
In respect of contracts which matured during the period, losses of 15.1 million and gains of 3.8 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively 2008 09 gains of 27.4 million and gains of 13.4 million.
Hedge ineffectiveness of 0.9 million loss was recorded in the income statement 2008 09 3.0 million gain.
Fair value hedges As mentioned above, the Group had interest rate swaps in place for the Bonds whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and pays a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps are used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 250 million 2009 300 million of the Bonds and have the same critical terms.
The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into as fair value hedges is an asset of 25.0 million 2009 an asset of 30.3 million.
A fair value loss on the interest rate swaps of 1.2 million 2008 09 gain of 28.0 million has been recognised in the income statement and offset by an equivalent fair value gain on the Bonds.
Hedge of net investments in foreign operations At 1 May 2010 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps in place with a notional value of 200 million 2009 374.0 million which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in foreign operations.
Gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the foreign operations.
The fair value of currency derivatives entered into as net investment hedges is a 74.8 million loss 2008 09 128.1 million loss.
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement 2008 09 nil.
d Interest rate profile of financial assets and financial liabilities by currency The following table sets out the interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
The financial instruments not included in the table ar e non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based either on daily bank deposit rates or central bank lending rates.
Floating rate notes have an effective yield of 1.00% 2009 1.88%.
Fixed rate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are predominantly money market deposits as shown in note 16 and earn interest at an average effective rate of 0.54% 2009 1.04%.
Floating rate borrowings include bank overdrafts and fixed rate bonds after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps entered into by the Group.
The weighted average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximates 1.5% 2009 3.7%.
The Groups interest rate swaps which relate to the Bonds have a nominal value of 250 million 2009 300 million receive fixed interest rates of 6.125% 2008 09 6.125% and pay floating rates of LIBOR plus a margin which ranged from 1.59% to 3.35% 2008 09 3.04% to 7.13%.
Currency swaps with a nominal value of 200 million 2009 250 million receive LIBOR plus a margin and pay EURIBOR plus a margin.
Other swaps which matured in the period exchanged Norwegian krone and sterling at fixed interest rates of 5.06% and 5.67% 2008 09 5.06% and 5.67%.
The other major component of floating rate borrowings is drawings under the 400 million Facility.
Interest on drawn amounts on the 400 million Facility was payable at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.75%.
The commitment fee on undrawn amounts was 1.875%.
A utilisation fee of 0.5% was payable on drawings greater than 200 million but less than 300 million and a rate of 1.5% on drawings greater than 300 million.
The terms of the New Facility are similar, but with a utilisation fee of 0.25% being payable on drawings greater than 120 million but less than 240 million and 0.5% payable on drawings greater than 240 million.
Both the 400 million Facility and the New Facility are described further in note 17.
Fixed rate borrowings refer to 50 million of the Bonds whereby the remainder have been swapped into floating rate borrowings as described in note 22 c. Amounts in respect of other currencies relate to funds held within subsidiary companies, operating in the Nordic region and Central Europe.
The negative cash balance in the prior year arose in a multi-currency pooled facility and is offset by positive euro balances.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
102 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10 Business Overview Strategic Summary Performance Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Information for Shareholders e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit loss before tax and total equity to changes in specified market variables on monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments as listed below.
As a consequence, the sensitivity reflects the position as at 1 May 2010 and 2 May 2009, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups profit loss before tax due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups total equity due to changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.
The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Groups key currencies of US dollar and euro, with other variables held constant.
A 10% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
Profit before tax Equity 2009 10 2008 09 2010 2009 Positive negative effect million million million million Change in exchange rates: US Dollar 10% 1.2 0.2 2.1 3.6 Euro 10% 2.5 2.1 1.0 39.6 Changes in interest rates affect the Groups profit loss before tax, mainly due to the impact of floating rate borrowings, cash and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The numbers below show the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant.
A 1% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on profit before tax and equity of 4.3 million 2008 09 a 7.2 million negative effect on loss before tax and equity.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance of borrowings, investments and the derivative portfolio are all held constant for the whole year.
all net investment, fair value and cash flow hedges are assumed to be highly effective.
the effect of changes in interest rates on fixed rate bonds is calculated after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
In combination these financial instruments are floating in nature.
changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges arising from movements in interest rates are recorded in the income statement.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is recorded directly in equity.
changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments that are not in hedging relationships arising from movements in interest rates and exchange rates only affect the income statement to the extent that they are not offset by changes in an underlying transaction.
f Liquidity risk The table below analyses the Groups contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities excluding finance lease liabilities, which are shown in note 18 and derivative assets and liabilities into their maturity groupings.

The Group reviews regularly its available cash resources and undrawn committed borrowing facilities required to fulfil its objectives and strategy.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared covering a five year period and these are updated annually.
Shorter term forecasts are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis in varying degrees of granularity including, in some cases, daily review.
These forecasts are used in determining both the level of borrowings required for funding purposes as well as planning for repayments of borrowings either at their maturity or sooner where practical.
An appropriate level of headroom is maintained to provide against unexpected outflows or an unforeseen downturn in trading.
Included in note 17 are details of committed facilities, which are also maintained and used if available on advantageous terms.

The Group reconstruction took the form of introducing a new parent company above the existing Group and the merger reserve represents the difference between the capital structure of the new parent company and that of the former parent company.
The Placing and Rights Issue was effected through a structure which resulted in a merger reserve arising under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Following receipt of the cash proceeds through the structure, the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital issued was transferred from the merger reserve to retained earnings.
2008 09: Transfers between retained earnings and other reserves relate to the fair value remeasurement of a put option held by a minority shareholder.

The number of shares held by the Trust is shown in the table below and relate to increases from the exercise of rights under the Placing and Rights Issue.
The Companys aim is to hedge in part its obligations under the LTIP, PSP and Reward Shares by buying shares through the Trusts to meet the anticipated future liability.
The anticipated liability is regularly reassessed during the relevant performance period and additional shares are purchased when required to meet an increase in this liability.
The costs of funding and administering the Trusts are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.

The ESOS and ESOP permit making awards with a market value on the date of grant of not more than twice the recipients salary apart from in exceptional circumstances when an award of not more than three times salary can be made.
Options are also granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade.
Vesting of options is based upon remaining in service with the Group over a three year period, unless specific circumstances apply to a participant as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Depending on grade, vesting is also dependent on the level of growth in underlying diluted earnings per share EPS over a three year period.
Options may be exercised up to seven years after the vesting date.
Save As You Earn SAYE The Group offers to all of its UK and Irish employees having completed the relevant period of service, share-based savings plans whereby amounts may be contributed up to a specified limit per plan and per employee.
Three year and five year plans have been offered annually, with exercise prices set at a 20% discount to the market share price on the date of grant.
Exercise is conditional upon employees remaining employed by the Group for the full term of the plan unless specific circumstances apply to a participant as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Employees can choose to withdraw their contributions in full from the plan at any time, together with any interest earned.
