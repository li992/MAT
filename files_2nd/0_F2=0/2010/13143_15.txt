Report of the Audit Committees continued The Committees conducted a formal review during 2010 of the performance of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the external audit process for the year ended 31 December 2009.
As part of this process, the Committees reviewed the report on the external auditors by the Audit Inspection Unit of the UK Financial Reporting Council issued in September 2010 and the report of the Autoriteit Financile Markten in the Netherlands issued on 1 September 2010 on the general findings of the quality and effectiveness of audits performed by external audit firms Rapport algemene bevindingen kwaliteit accountantscontrole en kwaliteitsbewaking.
Based on these reviews, and on their subsequent observations on the planning and execution of the external audit for the year ended 31 December 2010, the Committees have recommended to the respective boards that resolutions for the reappointment of the external auditors be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meetings.
Deloitte LLP and Deloitte Accountants BV or their predecessor Deloitte firms were first appointed respectively auditors of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV for the financial year ended 31 December 1994.
In addition to the annual review of the performance of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process, at least every four years the Committees will consider whether the objectives of the audit would be better served through a formal tender process for the auditor appointment.
The effectiveness of the operation of the Audit Committees was reviewed as part of the effectiveness review of the Boards in December 2010.

The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest schemes, which cover the majority of employees, are in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
Under these plans, employees are entitled to retirement benefits dependent on the number of years service provided.
The principal assumptions for the purpose of valuation under IAS19 Employee Benefits are determined for each scheme in conjunction with the respective schemes independent actuaries and are presented below as the weighted average of the various defined benefit pension schemes.
The defined benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31 December of the prior year.
As at 31 December 2010 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.6% 5.8% 6.2% Expected rate of return on scheme assets 6.8% 7.0% 7.1% Expected rate of salary increases 4.1% 4.0% 3.7% Inflation 3.2% 3.1% 2.7% Future pension increases 3.2% 3.1% 2.8% The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant market indices and market expectations of real rates of return.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on the weighted average of each asset category.
Mortality assumptions used in assessing defined benefit obligations make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics and the actuaries expectations for each scheme.
The average life expectancies assumed in the valuation of the defined benefit obligations are set out below.

As at 31 December 2010 the defined benefit obligations comprise 3,531m 2009: 3,172m in relation to funded schemes and 146m 2009: 130m in relation to unfunded schemes.
The weighted average duration of defined benefit scheme liabilities is 19 years 2009: 19 years.
Deferred tax liabilities of 15m 2009: 31m and deferred tax assets of 78m 2009: 122m are recognised in respect of the pension scheme surpluses and deficits respectively.

Sensitivity analysis Valuation of Reed Elseviers pension scheme liabilities involves judgements about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates are used for each of these factors, determined in conjunction with independent actuaries.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies would have the following approximate effects on the annual net pension expense and the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: Decrease increase in annual net pension expense 5 Decrease increase in defined benefit pension obligations 162 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 5 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 87 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 5 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 137 Additionally, the annual net pension expense includes an expected return on scheme assets.
A 5% increase decrease in the market value of equity investments held by the defined benefit pension schemes would, absent any change in their expected long term rate of return, increase decrease the amount of the expected return on scheme assets by 9m and would decrease increase the amount of the net pension obligations by 98m.
Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2010 Reed Elsevier 103 Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 6 Share based remuneration Reed Elsevier provides a number of share based remuneration schemes to directors and employees.

Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs, disposal gains and losses and other non operating items, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term and includes the benefit of tax amortisation where available on acquired goodwill and intangible assets.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration and, from 2010, professional and other transaction related fees and adjustments to deferred and contingent consideration.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs.
Adjusted figures are derived as follows: 2010 2009 m m Operating profit 1,090 787 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 349 368 Impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill 177 Exceptional restructuring costs 57 182 Acquisition related costs 50 48 Reclassification of tax in joint ventures 9 8 Adjusted operating profit 1,555 1,570 Profit before tax 768 435 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 349 368 Impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill 177 Exceptional restructuring costs 57 182 Acquisition related costs 50 48 Reclassification of tax in joint ventures 9 8 Disposals and other non operating items 46 61 Adjusted profit before tax 1,279 1,279 Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2010 Reed Elsevier 109 Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 10 Adjusted figures continued 2010 2009 m m Profit attributable to parent companies shareholders 642 391 Adjustments post tax : Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 337 411 Impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill 136 Exceptional restructuring costs 37 133 Acquisition related costs 30 33 Disposals and other non operating items 37 22 Deferred tax credits on acquired intangible assets not expected to crystallise in the near term 100 100 Adjusted profit attributable to parent companies shareholders 983 982 Cash generated from operations 1,649 1,604 Dividends received from joint ventures 24 23 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 83 78 Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment 7 4 Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets 228 164 Payments in relation to exceptional restructuring costs 99 124 Payments in relation to acquisition related costs 51 45 Adjusted operating cash flow 1,519 1,558 11 Statement of cash flows 2010 2009 Reconciliation of operating profit before joint ventures to cash generated from operations m m Operating profit before joint ventures 1,068 772 Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill 345 533 Amortisation of internally developed intangible assets 158 139 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 79 84 Share based remuneration 7 17 Total non cash items 575 773 Decrease in inventories and pre-publication costs 35 47 Decrease in receivables 24 112 Decrease in payables 53 100 Decrease in working capital 6 59 Cash generated from operations 1,649 1,604 2010 2009 Cash flow on acquisitions Note m m Purchase of businesses 12 38 9 Payment of ChoicePoint change of control and other non operating payables assumed 7 56 Deferred payments relating to prior year acquisitions 5 29 Total 50 94 110 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2010 Overview Our business Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Combined financial statements Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 11 Statement of cash flows continued Related derivative Cash & cash financial equivalents Borrowings instruments 2010 2009 Reconciliation of net borrowings m m m m m At start of year 734 4,706 41 3,931 5,726 Increase in cash and cash equivalents 301 Net movement in short term bank loans, overdrafts and commercial paper 143 143 107 Issuance of other loans 1,807 Repayment of other loans 394 394 2,862 Repayment of finance leases 7 7 2 Change in net borrowings resulting from cash flows 544 544 1,251 Inception of finance leases 2 2 26 Fair value adjustments to borrowings and related derivatives 52 63 11 11 Exchange translation differences 8 86 1 77 559 At end of year 742 4,302 105 3,455 3,931 Net borrowings comprise cash and cash equivalents, loan capital, finance leases, promissory notes, bank and other loans, and those derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents include 4m 2009: 5m held in trust to satisfy liabilities in respect of change of control obligations related to the acquisition of ChoicePoint.
12 Acquisitions During the year a number of small acquisitions were made for a total consideration of 43m 2009: 11m, after taking account of net cash acquired of nil.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
Provisional fair values of the consideration given and of the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below.
Fair Fair value value 2010 2009 m m Goodwill 27 6 Intangible assets 27 17 Current liabilities 2 11 Deferred tax 9 1 Net assets acquired 43 11 Consideration after taking account of nil net cash acquired 43 11 Less: consideration deferred to future years 5 2 Net cash flow 38 9 Goodwill, being the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, represents benefits which do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, including the ability of a business to generate higher returns than individual assets, skilled workforces, acquisition synergies that are specific to Reed Elsevier, and high barriers to market entry.
In addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2010 Reed Elsevier 111 Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 12 Acquisitions continued The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2011 combined financial statements.
There were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2009.
The businesses acquired in 2010 contributed 2m to revenue, decreased adjusted operating profit by 1m, decreased adjusted profit attributable by 1m, decreased profit attributable by 3m, and contributed nil net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit attributable and profit attributable for the year would have been 6,065m, 1,556m, 984m and 643m respectively before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
13 Equity dividends 2010 2009 Ordinary dividends declared in the year m m Reed Elsevier PLC 245 228 Reed Elsevier NV 240 232 Total 485 460 Ordinary dividends declared in the year, in amounts per ordinary share, comprise: a 2009 final dividend of 15.0p and a 2010 interim dividend of 5.4p giving a total of 20.4p 2009: 20.4p for Reed Elsevier PLC: and a 2009 final dividend of 80.293 and a 2010 interim dividend of 80.109 giving a total of 80.402 2009: 80.397 for Reed Elsevier NV.
The directors of Reed Elsevier PLC have proposed a final dividend of 15.0p 2009: 15.0p.
The directors of Reed Elsevier NV have proposed a final dividend of 80.303 2009: 80.293.
The total cost of funding the proposed final dividends is expected to be 361m, for which no liability has been recognised at the statement of financial position date.
2010 2009 Ordinary dividends paid and proposed relating to the financial year m m Reed Elsevier PLC 245 245 Reed Elsevier NV 246 250 Total 491 495 Dividends paid to Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV shareholders are, other than in special circumstances, equalised at the gross level inclusive of the UK tax credit of 10% received by certain Reed Elsevier PLC shareholders.
The cost of funding the Reed Elsevier PLC dividends is therefore similar to that of Reed Elsevier NV.

Impairment charges in 2009 comprise 93m in Reed Business Information, principally relating to its US and International businesses, and 17m in Reed Exhibitions, principally in Reed Exhibitions Continental Europe.
Impairment review Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is performed at least annually based on cash generating units CGUs.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets.
CGUs which are not individually significant have been aggregated for presentation purposes.
Typically, when an acquisition is made the acquired business is fully integrated into the relevant business unit and CGU, and the goodwill arising is allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
The carrying value of goodwill recorded in the major groups of CGUs is set out below.
2010 2009 Goodwill m m Elsevier 994 963 LexisNexis US Legal 1,064 1,012 LexisNexis Risk Solutions 1,720 1,659 LexisNexis International 115 133 LexisNexis 2,899 2,804 Reed Exhibitions Continental Europe 293 304 Reed Exhibitions other 66 60 Reed Exhibitions 359 364 Reed Business Information US 63 73 Reed Business Information UK 71 69 Reed Business Information NL 24 29 Reed Business Information International 31 37 Reed Business Information 189 208 Total 4,441 4,339 The carrying value of each CGU is compared with its estimated value in use, which is determined to be its recoverable amount.
Value in use is calculated based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value.
Estimated future cash flows are determined by reference to latest budgets and forecasts for the next five years approved by management, after which a long term perpetuity growth rate is applied.
The estimates of future cash flows are consistent with past experience adjusted for managements estimates of future performance.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are discount rates and perpetuity growth rates.
The discount rates used are based on the Reed Elsevier weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect a risk premium specific to each CGU.
The Reed Elsevier weighted average cost of capital reflects an assumed equity return, based on the risk free rate for government bonds adjusted for an equity risk premium, and the Reed Elsevier post tax cost of debt.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are 9.5% for Elsevier, 10.0-10.5% for LexisNexis, 10.5-11.0% for Reed Exhibitions and 10.5-12.0% for Reed Business Information.
Cash flows subsequent to the forecast period of five years are assumed to grow at nominal perpetuity growth rates.
The rates assumed are based on long term historic growth rates of the territories where the CGUs operate and the growth prospects for the sectors in which the CGUs operate.
The nominal perpetuity growth rates for all CGUs do not exceed 3%.
The value in use calculations and impairment reviews are sensitive to changes in key assumptions, particularly relating to discount rates and cash flow growth.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management: an increase in the discount rate of 0.5%: a decrease in the compound annual growth rate CAGR for adjusted operating cash flow in the five year forecast period of 2.0%: and a decrease in perpetuity growth rates of 0.5%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that impairment charges resulting from these sensitivity scenarios would be less than 10m.

The main financial risks faced by Reed Elsevier are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Reed Elsevier businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Reed Elseviers businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk Reed Elsevier maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements, at short notice and at competitive rates.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and includes contractual gross cash flows to be exchanged as part of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

The carrying amount of derivative financial assets comprises 105m 2009: 50m in relation to fair value hedges, 12m 2009: 12m in relation to cash flow hedges and 17m 2009: 9m held for trading.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities held for trading comprise interest rate derivatives and forward foreign exchange contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments.
At 31 December 2010, Reed Elsevier had access to a $2,000m committed bank facility maturing in June 2013, which was undrawn.
After taking account of the maturity of committed bank facilities that back short term borrowings at 31 December 2010, and after utilising available cash resources, no borrowings mature within two years 2009: nil, 23% of borrowings mature in the third year 2009: 19%, 27% in the fourth and fifth years 2009: 35%, 39% in the sixth to tenth years 2009: 36%, and 11% beyond the tenth year 2009: 10%.
Market risk Reed Elseviers primary market risks are to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by Reed Elsevier for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk Reed Elseviers interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the combined businesses to changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2010, 73% of gross borrowings were either fixed rate or had been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 3m 2009: 4m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2010.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 3m 2009: 4m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2010 is restricted to the change in carrying value of floating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated reduction in net equity of 8m 2009: 14m and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by an estimated 9m 2009: 15m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Foreign exchange rate risk Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than sterling, most particularly in respect of the US businesses.
These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars see note 24.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2010 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 457m 2009: 466m.
This would be offset to a large degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 270m 2009: 321m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2010 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 570m 2009: 581m and increase net borrowings by 329m 2009: 392m.
A retranslation of the combined businesses net profit for the year assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures would reduce net profit by 51m 2009: 17m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 62m 2009: 20m.
118 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2010 Overview Our business Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Combined financial statements Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 18 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Reed Elsevier seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
Reed Elsevier also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than A A2 by Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch.
Reed Elsevier also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers that include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law firms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the statement of financial position.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due but for which no allowance has been made.
Past due up to one month 241m 2009: 248m : past due two to three months 58m 2009: 66m : past due four to six months 16m 2009: 25m : and past due greater than six months 5m 2009: nil.
Examples of trade receivables which are past due but for which no allowance has been made include those receivables where there is no concern over the creditworthiness of the customer and where the history of dealings with the customer indicate the amount will be settled.
Hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS39 Financial Instruments are described below: Fair value hedges Reed Elsevier has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives including cross currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 1,093m 2009: 1,104m were in place at 31 December 2010 swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in sterling, euros and Swiss francs CHF to floating rate sterling, euro and US dollar USD debt respectively for the whole of their term.
Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2010 Reed Elsevier 119 Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 18 Financial instruments continued The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges, which are included in the income statement, for the two years ended 31 December 2010 were as follows: Fair value Fair value 1 January movement Exchange 1 January movement Exchange 31 December Gains losses on borrowings 2009 gain loss gain loss 2010 gain loss gain loss 2010 and related derivatives m m m m m m m GBP debt 9 9 16 7 Related interest rate swaps 9 9 16 7 EUR debt 2 2 10 12 Related interest rate swaps 2 210 12 CHF debt 41 11 4 48 37 1 86 Related CHF to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 41 11 4 48 37 1 86 Total GBP, EUR and CHF debt 41 4 4 41 63 1 105 Total related interest rate derivatives 41 4 4 41 63 1 105 Net gain All fair value hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2010.
Gross borrowings as at 31 December 2010 included 51m 2009: 59m in relation to fair value adjustments to borrowings previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship which were fide-designated in 2008.
The related derivatives were closed out on fide-designation with a cash inflow of 62m.
10m 2009: 11m of these fair value adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction to finance costs.
Cash flow hedges Reed Elsevier enters into two types of cash flow hedge: 1 I nterest rate derivatives which fix the interest expense on a portion of forecast floating rate debt including commercial paper, short term bank loans and floating rate term debt.
2 Foreign exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the Elsevier science and medical businesses for up to 50 months.
Movements in the hedge reserve pre-tax in 2009 and 2010, including gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments, were as follows: Foreign Total hedge Interest rate exchange reserve hedges hedges pre-tax m m m Hedge reserve at 1 January 2009: losses deferred 80 176 256 Losses gains arising in 2009 11 64 53 Amounts recognised in income statement 46 58 104 Exchange translation differences 73 10 Hedge reserve at 1 January 2010: losses deferred 38 51 89 Losses arising in 2010 15 43 58 Amounts recognised in income statement 26 35 61 Exchange translation differences 2 2 Hedge reserve at 31 December 2010: losses deferred 29 59 88 All cash flow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2010.
A tax credit of 21m 2009: 24m in respect of the above gains and losses at 31 December 2010 was also deferred in the hedge reserve.
