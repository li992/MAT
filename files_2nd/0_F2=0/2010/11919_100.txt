Prior to 1 January 1998 allgoodwill was written off to reserves on the date of acquisition.
3,090m of the carrying value relates to acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 and 1,478m relates to acquisitions completed after 1January2003 the date of transition to IFRS.
For acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 no value was ascribed to intangibles other thangoodwill and the goodwill on each acquisition was amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
On adoption of IFRSon1January 2003, the Group chose not to restate the goodwill balance and at that date the balance was frozen i. e. amortisation ceased.
If goodwill had been restated then a significant value would have been ascribed to other intangible assets, which would be subject to amortisation, and the carrying value of goodwill would be significantly lower.
For acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 value has been ascribed to other intangible assets which are amortised.
other intangible assets Other intangibles acquired include content, technology, contracts and software rights.
Amortisation of 3m 2009:5m is included inthe income statement in cost of goods sold and 149m 2009: 126m in administrative and other expenses.

The recoverable amount for each unit tested exceeds its carrying value.
Goodwill in respect of continuing operations is allocated to 12 cash-generating units CGUs within the business segments as follows: All figures in millions 2010 2009 US Education Publishing 1,976 1,876 US School Assessment and Information 683 652 Canada 197 181 International Education Publishing 686 468 International Education Assessment and Testing 227 222 Professional Publishing 13 13 Professional Assessment and Training 287 226 Pearson education total 4,069 3,638 Financial Times 48 43 Mergermarket 136 125 Ft Group total 184 168 Penguin US 196 190 Penguin UK 103 103 Penguin Asia Pacific & International 16 63 Penguin total 315 356 continuing operations 4,568 4,162 Interactive Data 184 total goodwill 4,568 4,346 As highlighted in the 2008 business review, integration of the US School and Higher Education businesses began in 2008.
Thisintegration continued throughout 2009 and advanced to a point where, from 1 January 2010, these companies have been combined into one CGU for impairment review purposes.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
The goodwill is generally denominated in the currency of the relevant cash flows and therefore the impairment review is not materially sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific CGU.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 11.2% to 12.1% for the Pearson Education businesses 2009: 10.9% to 11.8%, 12.9% to20.0% for the FT Group businesses 2009: 12.7% to 18.1% and 10.5% to 13.0% for the Penguin businesses 2009: 9.5% to11.4%.
