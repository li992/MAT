The remaining 49.0m was acquired by the Company in consideration of the issue of ordinary shares see share capital note.
Tier 2 preference shares and B shares Immediately prior to the Listing, each of the remaining Tier 2 preference shares was subdivided into 50 shares and a proportion were re-designated and converted into ordinary shares with the balance being converted into deferred shares.
Each B share was subdivided into 50 shares of 2p each and each subdivided share was converted into and re-designated as an ordinary share see share capital note.
Repayable to employees in respect of share awards Conditions were attached to certain of the B shares which would in some circumstances have required the Company to repurchase the shares at the original cost of issue: these conditions were carried over to certain of the ordinary shares, which resulted from the conversion of the B shares and the liability recognised in loans and borrowings.
As at 31 December 2010, 130.2m 2009: nil ordinary shares were subject to these restrictions.
