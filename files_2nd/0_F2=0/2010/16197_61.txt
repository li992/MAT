Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 18.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition, the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The Group considers the carrying value of all the financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as the fair value.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
The Group predominantly sells to large oil and gas multinationals and no financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date and all are considered to be fully recoverable.
Fair values of derivative instruments Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in such fair value between accounting periods being recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
The fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices marked-to-market values where available.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Groups derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: Less than One to Total 31 December 2010 one year three years 2010 Liabilities $m $m $m Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives 12.7 4.9 17.6 Gas derivatives 7.0 7.3 14.3 Interest rate derivatives 8.4 5.2 13.6 28.1 17.4 45.5 Deferred premium Oil derivatives 18.7 17.8 36.5 Gas derivatives 0.3 0.1 0.4 19.0 17.9 36.9 Total assets liabilities 47.1 35.3 82.4 Less than One to Total 31 December 2009 one year three years 2009 Liabilities $m $m $m Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives 12.7 2.4 15.1 Gas derivatives 13.4 0.1 13.5 Interest rate derivatives 6.0 2.9 8.9 20.1 0.4 19.7 Deferred premium Oil derivatives 17.8 19.6 37.4 Gas derivatives 17.8 19.6 37.4 Total assets 2.3 20.0 17.7 128 Tullow Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Accounts TU062 P100-153.

The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: All derivative financial instruments of the Group are Level 2 2009: Level 2, 2008: Level 2.
Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Oil and gas prices The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and gas revenues.
Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2010, the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil hedges H1 2011 H2 2011 2012 2013 Volume bopd 16,500 16,500 10,500 7,500 Average Price $ bbl 93.56 93.73 94.44 93.88 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2010 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.

As at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis.
There is, however, the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arises from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.
Income statement hedge summary Gains from settlements during the period amounted to $3.4 million 2009:$23.8 million note 2 and these are included in the revenue line.
The changes in the fair value of hedges which are required to be recognised immediately in the income statement for the year were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Loss gain on hedging instruments: $m $m $m Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives Ineffectiveness 0.2 Time value 11.9 6.0 10.6 11.9 6.0 10.8 Oil derivatives Ineffectiveness 0.2 6.9 11.8 Time value 15.6 58.9 44.0 15.8 65.8 55.8 Total net loss gain for the year in the income statement 27.7 59.8 66.6 Hedge reserve summary The hedge reserve represents the portion of deferred gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges.
The movement for the period in the hedge reserve is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Revaluation losses on open contracts arising during the year amounted to $26.8 million while reclassification adjustments for losses included in profit on realisation amounted to $10.3 million.
After tax effects of $8.2 million the total movement in the hedge reserve amounts to $28.9 million note 22 : 2010 2009 2008 Deferred amounts in the hedge reserve $m $m $m At 1 January 3.2 46.9 263.6 Revaluation losses arising in the year 26.8 18.0 66.6 Reclassification adjustments for losses gains included in profit on realisation 10.3 13.3 384.1 Movement in deferred tax 8.2 12.4 7.0 28.9 43.7 310.5 At 31 December 25.7 3.2 46.9 130 Tullow Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Accounts TU062 P100-153.

Oil and gas sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being dated Brent oil prices and UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas prices.
The sensitivity analysis, which is used internally by management to monitor financial derivatives, has been prepared using the following assumptions: The pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark-to-market MTM evaluations: The price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil and gas hedges: and The sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management consider this to be the material component of the MTM oil and gas hedges.
As at 31 December 2010, a 10% increase in the dated Brent oil price curve would have decreased equity by approximately $21.8 million 2009: $16.4 million, 2008: $31.9 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately $5.9 million 2009: $10.5 million, 2008: $39.1 million.
As at 31 December 2010, a 10% increase in the UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas price curves would have decreased equity by approximately $8.6 million 2009: $4.6 million, 2008: $15.2 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately $3.4 million 2009: $5.1 million, 2008: $14.9 million.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2010, the interest rate derivative position was out-of-the-money to an amount of $13.6 million 2009: $8.9 million, 2008: $3.9 million : a 25bps increase in the underlying interest rate would increase equity by approximately $1.2 million 2009: $2.4 million, 2008: $0.8 million.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The primary activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration and production.
The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The Group limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their credit worthiness after transactions have been initiated.
The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract upon the occurrence of certain events of default.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables and other current assets, as at 31 December 2010 was $1,153.0 million 2009: $643.9 million, 2008: $709.7 million.
