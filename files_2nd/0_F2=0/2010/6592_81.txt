Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment with no impairment charges resulting.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, a CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
all of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
In the case of an individual CGU within the Groups aerospace propulsion Systems business, value in use at 31 December 2M1M was measured using operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years which incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes.
Management consider forecasting over this period to more appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of that CGUs programmes, in particular the growth of certain military programmes.
Key assumptions In determining the recoverable amount of all CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Driveline businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain US military and civil programmes within aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of ongoing capital expenditure required to support forecast production.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based upon long term government bonds in the territory, or territories, within which each CGU operates.
a relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs within the reportable segments.
Driveline: North and South america 13%-24% 2MM9: 13%-24%, europe 12%-13% 2MM9: 12%-13% and Japan and asia pacific region countries 1M%-17% 2MM9: 1M%-17%.

In each case, this is not greater than the published oxford economic Forecast average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates from 1% to 9% 2MM9: 1% to 9% with most countries between 2% and 4% in both years.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to likely and potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been reviewed.
at 31 December 2M1M, the date of the Groups annual impairment test, the estimated recoverable amount of two individual CGUs within the Groups aerospace operations and one CGU within the Groups Driveline operations exceeded their carrying value by 53 million, 11 million and 74 million respectively.
The table below shows the discount rate, long term growth rate and forecast operating cashflow assumptions used in the calculation of value in use and the amount by which each assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to exceed the carrying value.
