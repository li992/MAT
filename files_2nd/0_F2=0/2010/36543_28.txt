60 Financial statements notes to the accounts 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES STATEMENT OF COMPlIANCE The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and interpretations adopted by the European Union.
During 2010, the following pronouncements either had no impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes to presentation and disclosure only: Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 Embedded Derivatives: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 30 June 2009 IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 IFRIC 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to Owners: effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers: effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, relating to transfers after that date Amendments to IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and guidance relevant to the Group were in issue but not yet effective: Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011 Amendments to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010 These pronouncements, when applied, will either result in changes to presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
bASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors Report on page 43.
The financial statements are presented in sterling.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that investment and development properties, owner-occupied properties, investments and derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period.
If the revision affects both current and future periods, the change is recognised over those periods.
SIGNIFICANT jUDGEMENTS AND kEy ESTIMATES The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Property valuations The property portfolio, which is carried in the balance sheet at fair value, is valued six-monthly by professionally qualified external valuers and the Directors must ensure that they are satisfied that the valuation of the Groups properties is appropriate for the accounts.
The independent valuations are based on a number of assumptions such as appropriate discount rates and estimates of future rental income and capital expenditure.
Property valuations are one of the principal uncertainties of the Group, as noted on page 15.
Other investments The Company holds other investments which are classified as available for sale and held at fair value on the balance sheet.
The fair value of these investments is based on the Directors valuation, having regard to external valuations of the underlying properties and the Groups interest in these properties.
Overview business and Financial review GOvernance Financial statements prOperty pOrtFOliO HammersOn plc ANNUAl REPORT 2010 61 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES Continued Accounting for acquisitions Management must assess whether the acquisition of property through the purchase of a corporate vehicle should be accounted for as an asset purchase or a business combination.
As noted in the accounting policy below, where the acquired company contains significant assets or liabilities in addition to property, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination.
Where there are no such items, the transaction is treated as an asset purchase.
Accounting for joint ventures The accounting treatment for our joint ventures requires an assessment to determine the degree of control or influence which the Group may exercise over them and the form of any control.
Hammersons interest in its joint ventures is commonly driven by the terms of partnership agreements which ensure that control is shared between the partners.
As a result, these are accounted for as jointly controlled entities and are included in the financial statements on a proportionate consolidation basis in accordance with IAS 31.
REIT and SIIC status The Company has elected for UK REIT and French SIIC status.
To continue to benefit from these tax regimes, the Group is required to comply with certain conditions as outlined in notes 8E and 8F to the accounts.
Management intends that the Group should continue as a UK REIT and French SIIC for the foreseeable future.
bASIS OF CONSOlIDATION Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity, or business, to benefit from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets or liabilities other than property, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition.
In other cases, particularly where there is an integrated set of activities and assets, capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return, the acquisition method is used.
joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of joint ventures.
Associates Associates are those entities over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Where the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is greater than the cost, the excess, known as negative goodwill, is recognised immediately in the income statement.
FOREIGN CURRENCy Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at exchange rates approximating to the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and, unless they relate to the hedging of the net investment in foreign operations, differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
62 Financial statements notes to the accounts continued 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES Continued Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The operating income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period.
Significant transactions, such as property sales, are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.
The principal exchange rate used to translate foreign currency-denominated amounts in the balance sheet is the rate at the end of the year, 1 1.167 2009: 1 1.126.
The principal exchange rate used for the income statement is the average rate, 1 1.166 2009: 1 1.123.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
bORROwINGS, INTEREST AND DERIvATIvES borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, borrowings are held at amortised cost, such that discounts and costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the borrowing at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency movements and interest rate risks.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value being included in the income statement, except that a gain or loss on the portion of an instrument that is an effective hedge for the net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in the hedging reserve.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value, subsequently measured at amortised cost and, where the effect is material, discounted to reflect the time value of money.
Net finance costs Net finance costs include interest payable on borrowings, net of interest capitalised, interest receivable on funds invested, and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Capitalisation of interest Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of development properties or the redevelopment of investment properties.
Capitalisation commences when the activities to develop the property start and continues until the property is substantially ready for its intended use.
Capitalised interest is calculated with reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, for that part of the development cost financed out of general funds, to the average rate.
PROPERTy PORTFOlIO Investment properties Investment properties are stated at fair value, being market value determined by professionally qualified external valuers, and changes in fair value are included in the income statement.
Development properties Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are classified as development properties and stated at fair value, being market value determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
Changes in fair value are included in the income statement.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a development property are capitalised.
When development properties are completed, they are reclassified as investment properties.
leasehold properties Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classified as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Payments to the freeholder or superior leaseholder are apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Contingent rents payable, such as rent reviews or those related to rental income, are charged as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred.
Overview business and Financial review GOvernance Financial statements prOperty pOrtFOliO HammersOn plc ANNUAl REPORT 2010 63 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES Continued Depreciation In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment and development properties, which are carried at fair value.
Leasehold property occupied by the Group owner-occupied property is depreciated where material over its expected useful life, giving due consideration to its estimated residual value.
Net rental income Rental income from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Contingent rents, such as turnover rents, rent reviews and indexation, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Rent reviews are recognised when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Lease incentives and costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over the period to the first break option or, if the probability that the break option will be exercised is considered low, over the lease term.
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and any property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through service charges is charged to the income statement.
Previously, the amortisation of lease incentives and other related costs had been included within other property outgoings.
These items are now included within gross rental income, which is considered to be a more appropriate classification.
As a result of this reclassification, for the year ended 31 December 2010, gross rental income and other property outgoings have been reduced by 9.5 million.
Comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2009 have been reduced by 7.2 million.
There is no impact on net rental income or profit.
Profits on sale of properties Profits on sale of properties are taken into account on the completion of contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
Tenant leases Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for properties leased to tenants and has determined that such leases are operating leases.
Plant, equipment and owner-occupied property Owner-occupied property held under a finance lease is stated at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is generally between three and five years, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term.
INvESTMENTS Investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
Where a significant or prolonged decline in fair value is identified, the investment is considered impaired and any cumulative revaluation gain or deficit is recycled through the income statement.
EMPlOyEE bENEFITS Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans comprises the amount of future benefit that employees have earned, discounted to determine a present value, less the fair value of the pension plan assets.
The discount rate used is the yield on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified external actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in equity.
Where the assets of a plan are greater than its obligation, the asset included in the balance sheet is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reduction in future contributions to the plan.
Share-based employee remuneration Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.
The fair value of share options is calculated using the binomial option pricing model and is dependent on factors including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk-free interest rate.
The fair value of the market-based element of the Long-Term Incentive Plans is calculated using the Monte Carlo Model and is dependent on factors including the expected volatility, vesting period and risk-free interest rate.
IFRS2 Share-based Payment has been applied to share options granted.
64 Financial statements notes to the accounts continued 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES Continued TAx Tax is included in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

66 Financial statements notes to the accounts continued 3 SEGMENTAl ANAlySIS The factors used to determine the Groups reportable segments are the geographic locations UK and Continental Europe and sectors in which it operates, which are generally managed by separate teams and are the basis on which performance is assessed and resources allocated.
Gross rental income represents the Groups revenue from external customers, or tenants.
Net rental income is the principal profit measure used to determine the performance of each sector.
Total assets are not monitored by segment and resource allocation is based on the distribution of property assets between segments.

If a UK REIT sells a property within three years of completion of development, the REIT exemption will not apply.
At 31 December 2010, the value of such completed development properties was 854 million 2009: 746 million and the potential tax charge that would arise if these properties were to be sold was nil 2009: nil.
E: Uk REIT STATUS The Group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 January 2007.
The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Groups UK property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on UK properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or sold in the three years after completion of development.
The Group is otherwise subject to UK corporation tax.
As a REIT, Hammerson plc is required to pay Property Income Distributions equal to at least 90% of the Groups exempted net income.
To remain a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Groups qualifying activity and its balance of business.
F: FRENCH SIIC STATUS Hammerson plc has been a French SIIC since 1 January 2004 and all the major French properties are covered by the SIIC tax-exempt regime.
Income and gains are exempted from French tax but the French subsidiaries are required to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson plc, which will then designate UK dividends paid to its shareholders as SIIC distributions.
Dividend obligations will arise principally after property disposals but for the Hammerson group there will be a period of around four years after a disposal for dividends to be paid to shareholders.
Outstanding SIIC dividend obligations arising on disposals and earnings prior to 31 December 2010 amount to 203 million 2009: 53 million and are expected to be settled within dividends paid by Hammerson plc over the following four years.
A further 239 million 2009:372million of dividends would be payable if the properties were realised at their 31 December 2010 values.
Since 1 July 2009, qualifying foreign dividends have been exempt from UK tax and therefore no deferred tax provision is recognised.
If Hammerson plc ceased to qualify as a French SIIC before 1 January 2014, tax penalties of 199 million 2009: 190 million would be payable.
To continue to qualify, at least 80% of assets must be employed in property investment and, with limited temporary exceptions, no shareholder may hold 60% or more of the shares.
74 Financial statements notes to the accounts continued 9 DIvIDENDS The proposed final dividend of 8.8 pence per share was recommended by the Board on 21 February 2011 and, subject to approval by shareholders, is payable on 13 May 2011 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 11 March 2011.
This will be paid entirely as a PID, net of withholding tax if applicable, except to the extent that shareholders elect to receive the scrip dividend alternative.
The aggregate amount of the 2010 final dividend is 62.3 million.
This assumes no shareholders elect to receive the scrip dividend alternative and has been calculated using the total number of eligible shares outstanding at 31 December 2010.
In 2009, the Company paid a second interim dividend of 8.5 pence per share in lieu of a final dividend.
The interim dividend of 7.15 pence per share, paid on 1 October 2010, was paid entirely as a normal dividend.
The total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 will be 15.95 pence per share 2009: 15.45 pence per share.

Overview business and Financial review GOvernance Financial statements prOperty pOrtFOliO HammersOn plc ANNUAl REPORT 2010 85 21 FINANCIAl INSTRUMENTS AND RISk MANAGEMENT Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Further discussion of these issues is set out in Principal uncertainties on page 15.
The Groups risk management policies and practices with regard to financial instruments are as follows: A: DEbT MANAGEMENT The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer-term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
b: INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to variable rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to variable rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had interest rate swaps of 100.0 million 2009: 100.0 million and 60.7 million 2009: nil maturing in 2013 and 2015 respectively.
Under these swaps the Group pays interest at fixed rates of 4.725% and 2.455% respectively and receives interest linked to LIBOR.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had interest rate swaps of 47.9 million maturing in 2010.
Under these swaps, the Group paid interest at a fixed rate of 6.275% and received interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR.
At 31 December 2010, the fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 8.5 million 2009: 10.2 million.
At 31 December 2009, the Group also had 300 million of interest rate swap options whereby the counterparties could require the Group to pay LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of 5.25% over the period 15 December 2010 to 15 December 2016.
These options were unexercised and matured on 15 December 2010.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
C: FOREIGN CURRENCy MANAGEMENT The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The Group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in Continental Europe, the Group has designated all euro borrowings, including euro denominated bonds and currency swaps, as hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2010 was 598.5 million 2009: 620.0 million and their fair value was 622.7 million 2009: 608.8 million.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had currency swaps of 501.3 million, being 590.1 million sold forward against sterling: 187.5 million for value in January 2011 at a rate of 1 1.182 and 402.6 million for value in February 2011, at a rate of 1 1.175.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had swaps of 485.6 million, being 532.9 million sold forward against sterling: 266.7 million for value in March 2010, at a rate of 1 1.090 and 266.2 million for value in June 2010, at a rate of 1 1.105.
The fair value of currency swaps is shown in note 21I.
The exchange differences on hedging instruments and on net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in equity.
D: PROFIT AND lOSS ACCOUNT AND bAlANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover, gearing and other ratios.
Management monitors the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial Review on page 31.
E: CASH MANAGEMENT AND lIqUIDITy Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Longer-term liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 21A above.
86 Financial statements notes to the accounts continued 21 FINANCIAl INSTRUMENTS AND RISk MANAGEMENT Continued F: CREDIT RISk The Groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is attributable to its trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Groups tenant base is diversified geographically, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance and the average unexpired lease term at 31 December 2010 was 8.8 years 2009: 8.6 years.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
The Groups most significant tenants are set out in the Business Review on page 23.
Loans receivable and other receivables include balances due from joint venture partners, available for sale investments and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
The receivables in notes 16 and 17 are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
An analysis of trade receivables and the related provisions is shown in note 17.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
At 31 December 2010, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was 252.1 million 2009: 347.1 million.

Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2010, it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased the Groups annual profit before tax by 3.3 million 2009: increase of 0.1 million and a decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups annual profit before tax by 3.5 million 2009: decrease of 0.6 million.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings and loans receivable, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
The decrease in the Groups annual profit before tax with a reduction in interest rates is due to the change in fair value of interest rate swaps having a greater charge than the saving on floating rate borrowings.
It is estimated that, in relation to financial instruments alone, a 10% strengthening of sterling against the euro, would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2010 by 101.5 million.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the euro would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2010 by 124.1 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, a 10% strengthening of sterling against the euro would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity by 122.3 million.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the euro would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity by 149.5 million.
However, these effects would be more than offset by the effect of exchange rate changes on the euro denominated net assets included in the Groups financial statements.
In relation to financial instruments alone, there would have been no impact on the Groups profit before tax.
This has been calculated by retranslating the year end euro denominated financial instruments at the year end foreign exchange rate changed by 10%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.
