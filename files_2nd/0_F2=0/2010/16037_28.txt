6. BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPhICAL SEGMENTS For management purposes, the Group was, prior to the acquisition of The Bss Group plc, organised into two operating divisions Merchanting and Retailing, both of which operate entirely in the united kingdom.
Following the acquisition of The Bss Group plc the Group will report a third segment, Bss, which operates mainly in the united kingdom.
As required by IFRs 8 the operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess their performance.
segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of share of losses of associates, finance income and costs and income tax expense.
There are no significant inter-segment sales.
During 2010 and 2009, other than in respect of fair value adjustments and exceptional charges made in respect of Bss assets, there were no impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses recognised in profit or loss or in equity in any of the reportable segments.

PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Defined benefit schemes Prior to the acquisition of The Bss Group plc, the Group operated a final salary scheme: the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit scheme the TP scheme, which is a 1 60th scheme.
The TP scheme is funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of the scheme every three years.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of the scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP scheme was carried out on 30 september 2008.
The IAs 19 valuation has been based upon the results of the 30 september 2008 valuation, then updated to 31 December 2010 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
Following the acquisition of The Bss group plc the Group now operates three additional defined benefit pension schemes the Bss schemes based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the schemes trustees.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 June 2009 for the main uk and Irish schemes and 31 December 2008 for the secondary uk scheme.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
In June 2010 an agreement was reached with the trustees of the Travis Perkins final salary pension scheme to fund 34.7m of the deficit using a group controlled special purpose vehicle.
The pension scheme will be entitled to receive the income of the sPV for a period of up to 20 years, subject to funding levels.
This income is backed by the security of 16 Travis Perkins freehold properties.
As the sPV is consolidated into the Travis Perkins plc group accounts advantage has been taken of Regulation 7 of The Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 and accounts for the sPV will neither be audited or filed.

The Company and Trustee agreed to amend the benefits of the TP scheme with effect from 1 December 2009 to include a cap on future pensionable salary increases of 3% per annum.
This was treated as an exceptional curtailment event and the resulting reduction in the benefit obligation was included as a curtailment gain in 2009 Note 5.
The directors have agreed with the scheme Actuary and the Trustees to pay contributions of 16.0m in 2011 in excess of the forecast charge to the income statement to the TP scheme.
In addition agreement has been made to pay 3.2m in respect of The Bss schemes.

j Defined contribution schemes Prior to the acquisition of The Bss Group plc there were two defined contribution schemes in the Group.
The Bss Group plc operates a further three defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees.
The pension cost, which represents contributions payable by the Group, amounted to 3.6m 2009: 3.2m.
ShARE-BASED PAYMENTS The following disclosures relate to share option and sAYE grants made after 7 November 2002.
The Black-scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
The probability of the performance conditions being achieved was included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model for options granted in the year expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2010 2009 Nil price Executive Nil price SAYE options sAYE options options share price at grant date pence Group 819 734 794 653 616 Option exercise price pence Group 691 - 636 663 - share price at grant date pence Company 819 734 794 653 616 Option exercise price pence Company 691 - 636 663 - Volatility % Group and Company 59.5% 62.1% 50.7% 61.0% 60.1% Option life years Group and Company 3.5 3.0 3.5 3.0 3.0 Risk-free interest rate % Group and Company 1.6% 1.3% 2.1% 2.2% 2.4% Expected dividends as a dividend yield % Group and Company 0.6% 0.6% 2.0% 1.6% 1.6% Volatility was based on historic share prices over a period of time equal to the vesting period.
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
sAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon uk Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of 3 times.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based upon managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGus are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions have been reviewed during the year in light of the current economic environment which has resulted in more conservative estimates about the future and the changing capital structure of the Company.
Management estimates 20386.04 proof 2 31 03 11 NO TES T O THE FINANCIAL S TATEMENT S 105 14.
GOODWILL CONTINUED discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGus.
As a result of these deliberations the discount rate has been amended to reflect changes in the capital structure arising from the rights issue.
The turnover growth rates in each CGu are based on the Directors expectations for the next 3 years.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs used in the calculations are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
At the beginning and end of the financial period the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets in all segments was in excess of their book value.
The Directors calculations have shown that no impairments have occurred.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: Cash flow forecasts which were derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans for the three years ending 2013, which were approved by the directors.
Cash flows for the following year are extrapolated from cash flows for 2013 using similar assumptions to those applied to 2013: The weighted average cost of capital W ACC of the Group which is used as the discount rate is 8.1% which is not significantly different for any individual CGu: Long-term forecast growth rates of 2.5% in line with the average long-term GDP growth trend applied from 2014 onwards.
Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible an impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
For instance factors which could cause an impairment are: significant underperformance relative to the forecast results: Changes to the way the assets are used or changes to the strategy for the business: A deterioration in the industry or the economy.
The impairment review calculations are based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
These calculations are sensitive to changes in future cash flows, the discount rate applied and the terminal growth rate.
The Directors believe the assumptions used are appropriate, but have conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the assumptions that would result in an impairment to goodwill and intangibles of 100m: Merchanting Retail Weighted average cost of capital 15.8% 10.8% Long term growth rate 9.0 % 0.9 % The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Bss on 14 December 2010 did not suffer an impairment during the two weeks of ownership by the Group.

These brands together with the Wickes brand which accounts for the remainder are all considered to be leading brands in their sectors with significant growth prospects.
They are considered therefore to have an indefinite useful life and are reviewed annually for impairment.
Acquired customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 5 to 15 years.
Details of impairment testing are given in note 14.
No impairments were identified in either year.
The Company has no intangible assets.

The Directors consider the only class of asset containing significant credit risk is trade receivables.
The average credit term taken for sales of goods is 55 days 2009: 54 days.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts of 44.4m 2009: 34.5m, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest between 2% to 4% above the clearing bank base rate per annum on the outstanding balance.
The merchanting division has provided fully for all receivables outstanding over 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables not receivable for up to 90 days are specifically provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade receivables within the Bss division are provided for based on prior experience and assessment of the current economic environment.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are unprovided against debtors with a carrying amount of 70.4m 2009: 20.9m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.

The impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the amount it is anticipated will be recovered.
None of the Companys debts are overdue.
The directors do not consider there to be any significant credit risk, as the majority of the debt is due from subsidiaries.

Excluding 999 year leases, the average loan term for these properties is 49 years and the average borrowing rate has been determined at the inception of the lease to be 8.9%.
In addition the Group leases certain fixtures and equipment under finance leases, the obligations for which are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
The average lease term is 3-4 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, the average implicit borrowing rate was 12.9% 2009: 13.4%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All lease obligations, which are denominated in sterling, are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
e Loan notes Included in borrowings due within one year are 3.3m 2009: 3.8m in respect of loan notes issued as consideration for the acquisition of Broombys Limited in 1999.
They are redeemable on 30 June and 31 December each year until the final redemption date of 30 June 2015.
BORROWINGS CONTINUED f Interest The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2010 2009 % % unsecured senior notes 5.8 5.8 Bank loans and overdraft 1.8 2.2 Other borrowings 6.0 5.4 Bank term loans and revolving credit facilities of 857m 2009: 1,000m were arranged at variable interest rates.
The $400m unsecured Travis Perkins senior notes and the $125m unsecured Bss Group senior notes were issued at fixed rates of interest and swapped into variable rates.
This exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
As detailed in note 26, to manage the risk the Group enters into interest rate derivatives arrangements, which for 2010, fixed interest rates on an average of 523m of borrowing.
For the year to 31 December 2010 this had the effect of increasing the weighted average interest rates paid by 1.25%.

There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and therefore no further information is disclosed.
Details about the fair values of derivatives are given in note 26. h Guarantees and security There are cross guarantees on the overdrafts between group companies.
The companies listed in note 18, with the exception of Benchmarx kitchens and Joinery Limited, Tile Giant Limited, PTs Group Limited and The Bss Group Limited, together with Wickes Limited are guarantors of the following facilities advanced to Travis Perkins plc: 382m term loan: 475m revolving credit facility: $400m unsecured senior notes note 25 i : Interest rate and currency derivatives, note 26.
The Bss Group Limited and PTs Group Limited along with 10 dormant subsidiaries are guarantors of $125m of the unsecured senior notes.
The group companies have entered into other guarantee and counter-indemnity arrangements in respect of guarantees issued in favour of group companies by the clearing banks amounting to approximately 21.1m 2009: 13.7m.
BORROWINGS CONTINUED i Unsecured senior notes On 26 January 2006 the Group finalised a us private placement that resulted in it receiving $400m.
$200m of the unsecured senior notes is repayable in January 2013 and $200m in January 2016.
The us borrowings carry fixed rate coupons of between 130 bps and 140 bps over us treasuries.
As described in note 26, to protect itself from currency movements and bring interest rate exposures back into line with the Groups desired risk profile the Group entered into five cross currency swaps.
On 11 May 2006 The Bss Group plc finalised a us private placement that resulted in it receiving $125m and repaying the sterling equivalent outstanding on the revolving credit facility.
Of this borrowing $75m is repayable in May 2013 with the remaining $50m repayable in May 2016.
In order to protect itself against currency movements and interest rate exposures the Bss Group entered into three cross currency interest rate swaps.

Trade and other payables exclude taxation and social security and accruals and deferred income totalling 168.9m.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yie ld curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.

The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
Interest rate swaps The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is either on a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defined limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profile the Group uses interest rate swaps.
As part of their interest rate management processes, in respect of the facilities described in note 25, the Group and the Company at the commencement of the year were parties to four amortising swaps each with an initial notional value of 100m, two amortising swaps with an initial notional value of 50m and two non amortising swaps each with a notional value of 50m.
Contracts with notional values of 400m are designated as cash flow hedges with fixed interest payments at an average rate of 1.51% for periods up until May 2011 and have floating interest receipts equal to 1 month LIBOR.
The non-amortising interest rate swap with a call option has a notional value of 50m with fixed interest payments at a rate of 4.595% for periods up until October 2013 and has floating interest payments equal to 6 month LIBOR.
At 31 December 2010 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate before three years from the balance sheet date, to which the Group and the Company were parties was estimated at 5.7m 2009: 6.1m.
This amount is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps excluding those with a call option are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
A credit of 0.7m 2009: 4.7m in respect of the fair value movement on interest rate swaps with a call option has been taken to the income statement through net finance charges as the Company has not applied hedge accounting.
Interest rate swap contracts under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash 20386.04 proof 2 31 03 11 NO TES T O THE FINANCIAL S TATEMENT S 117 26.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges outstanding receive floating pay fixed contracts Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principle amount Fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 % % m m m m Less than 1 year 1.52% - 400.0 - 1.6 - 1 to 2 years - 1.51% - 530.0 - 2.6 Greater than 5 years 5.40% - 29.0 - 2.5 - 429.0 530.0 0.9 2.6 The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 1 month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest rate payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in the income statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
Currency swaps In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the $400m unsecured senior notes described in note 25 i the Group and the Company entered into five cross currency swaps in varying amounts between 23m and 63m to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire lives of the unsecured loan notes.
The forward options fixed the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the unsecured senior notes to 231m as well as fixing the exchange rate applicable to future coupon payments.
During the year the Group and Company novated one cross currency interest rate swap with a notional value of $110m and a sterling equivalent of 63m for total proceeds of 13.7m in the Group and 16.3m in the Company.
The proceeds are being amortised to the income statement over the remain life of the unsecured senior notes.
The remaining currency swaps manage the Groups and the Companys exposure to the fixed interest rate on the us dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a private placement on 26 January 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps of 58m that convert the borrowing rate on $200m of debt from 5.77% to a variable rate on 6 month LIBOR plus a weighted average basis point increment of 81.9.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were both at 5.43%.
A further two interest rate swaps of 29m and 23m convert the borrowing rates on us$50m, us$40m of debt from 5.89% to a variable rate based on six month LIBOR plus basis point increment of 86.5 and 86.7 respectively.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were at weighted average 5.47%.
In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the Bss private placement of $125m The Bss Group plc entered into three cross currency interest rate swaps to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire duration of the private placement.
The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is six month LIBOR.
There are two interest rate swaps on the seven year borrowing of 29m and 14m that convert the borrowings on $50m and $25m respectively from 5.8% to a variable rate on six month LIBOR plus a basis point increment of 64.75 and 66.79.
At 31 December 2010 the fair value of cross currency derivatives was estimated at 54.1m 2009: 44.7m.
All of these currency swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges.
A further interest rate swap on the ten year borrowing of 29m converts the borrowing on the $50m debt from 5.91% to a fixed rate of 4.7% plus a basis point increment of 70.75.
This is accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
At 31 December 2010 this cash flow hedge had an estimated fair value of 2.5m.
In April 2010 the Group and the Company entered into three forward contracts to purchase us$ with a notional value of $30m each and one with a notional value of 20m.
These contracts have a maturity date of January 2016.
At 31 December 2010 the fair value of these forward contracts was estimated at 0.3m.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 6 months LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest on a net basis.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest for floating rate interest are designated and effective as fair value hedges in respect of interest rates.
During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by 38.4m 2009: 39.7m, which was included in the income statement at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap was included in the income statement.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in sterling are paid for principally in us dollars.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than one year in duration to buy us dollars to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was us$93.6m 2009: us$40m.
The fair value of these derivatives is 1.0m 2009: 0m.
These contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
On 15 October 2010 the Company derecognised the dollar receivable on $273m of cross currency interest rate swaps and transferred the rights to that receivable to a subsidiary.
The dollar legs had maturity dates and amounts of $188m in January 2013 and $85m in January 2016.
The total fair value of the dollar cross currency interest rate swaps in the Company is 120.5m.
On the 15 October the Company subscribed to $273m of dollar preference shares issued by a subsidiary company.
These preference shares carry a right to receive interest and a total credit of 2.1m has been recognised in the income statement.
The investment in the preference shares has been retranslated at year end rates with a gain of 4.3m being recognised in the income statement.
The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: Profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2010 would have decreased increased by 0.2m 2009: increased decreased by 3m including 1m 2009: 2m of movement on interest rate swaps with options: Net equity would have increased decreased by 0.2m 2009: increased decreased by 6m mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the increase in the nominal value of interest rate derivatives.
