The merger reserve relates to merger relief on the issue of shares.
The share placing announced on 28 April 2010 qualified for merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
The excess of the value of the shares issued over the nominal value has therefore been recorded in the merger reserve.
In addition, it was identified in 2010 that the shares issued in 2008 qualified for merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Consequently, an amount of 32.2m originally recorded in share premium was transferred to the merger reserve during the year.
Distributable reserves relate to amounts in the retained earnings reserve to the extent that profits are realised.
