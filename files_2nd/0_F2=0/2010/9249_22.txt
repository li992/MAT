Notes to the financial statementsfor the year ended 31 December 2010 1 A uthorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31December 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 9 March 2011 and the statement of financial position was signed on the Boards behalf by PJHill and JCSilver.
Laird PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union IFRS and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2 Accounting policies Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, that have been measured at fair value, and accounting for pensions.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make judgements and assumptions that aff ect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods.
Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may diff er from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of goodwill, the measurement of defined benefit pension assets and obligations and the measurement of income and deferred taxes.
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated.
This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate see note 17.
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates, the expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate see note 35.
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgements are applied in deciding the level of provisions for income taxes.
To the extent that the final outcome diff ers from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to provisions held in the period the determination is made.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Group comprises Laird PLC and its subsidiary undertakings the Group.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies where appropriate.
Intragroup balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, costs directly attributable to the combination were capitalised.
The identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
70 Laird PLC 2 Accounting policies continued Currency translation continued Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling using weighted average rates of exchange for the period.
Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange diff erences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange diff erences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements in equity.
All other exchange diff erences are dealt with in the income statement for the period.
Exchange diff erences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange diff erences held in shareholders equity that relate to the disposed operation are transferred to the income statement.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intragroup sales and valueadded taxes and represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Retirement benefit obligations Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the income statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate.
The Group applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Share based payments The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Restricted Share Plan RSP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Nonmarket company performance and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied.
Laird PLC 71 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 2 Accounting policies continued Share based payments continued At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of nonmarket conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.
Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straightline basis.
The estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between 3 and 20 years depending on its nature.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including commercial and technological feasibility have been met.
Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically less than three years.
Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the income statement.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary diff erences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary diff erence arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction eff ects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary diff erences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary diff erences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary diff erences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary diff erences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised 72 Laird PLC 2 Accounting policies continued Income taxes continued Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
Dividends Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability of the Company.
Interest Interest is recognised in the income statement using the eff ective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assembly costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years or less Leasehold buildings 50 years or the lease term if less Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cashgenerating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and the related charges are expensed to the income statement evenly over the lease term.
Laird PLC 73 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 2 Accounting policies continued Leases continued Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or noncurrent, trade and other payables.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Segment reporting Segments are identified on the basis of management information which is presented to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker to assess the performance of each segment.
Exceptional items These items are presented within the relevant income statement category.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include the restructuring of businesses, the transaction costs of acquiring new businesses, the integration of new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
Financial assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Trade and other receivables are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial diff iculties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
These assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the income statement.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the income statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interestbearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
74 Laird PLC 2 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 these are Level 2 derivative financial instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how eff ectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be eff ective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing eff ectiveness.
Cash flow hedges These are used to hedge potential changes in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions.
For cash flow hedges, the eff ective portion of the fair value movement on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineff ective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction aff ects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a nonfinancial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a nonfinancial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
Net investment hedges These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an eff ective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineff ective portion recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any diff erence between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash in the statement of financial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and shortterm deposits with an original maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses principally administration costs are excluded.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Laird PLC 75 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 2 Accounting policies continued Provisions These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
New Standards and Interpretations not applied At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet eff ective for the financial period: International Accounting Financial Reporting Standards IAS IFRS Eff ective date IAS 32 Amendment Classification of Rights Issues 1 February 2010 IAS 24 Amendment Related Party Disclosures 1 January 2011 IFRSs Improvements 1 January 2011 IFRS 7 Amendment Financial Instruments : Disclosures 1 July 2011 IAS 12 Amendment Income Taxes 1 January 2012 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement 1 January 2013 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 1 July 2010 IFRIC 14 Amendment Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement 1 January 2011 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application and plan to adopt these standards and interpretations in line with their eff ective dates.
3 Segmental analysis In 2009, the Group reported the following segments: Performance Materials, Handset Products and Wireless Systems.
During 2010, the Group reorganised the Handset Products division.
It was announced that the Mechanisms business would be exited and it is anticipated that all Mechanisms activity will cease during 2011.
Once production has ceased the product line will be transferred to discontinued operations.
This business unit is shown separately in the analysis below.
The mobile antenna business that was previously in the Handset Products division is now included in the Wireless Systems division.
The specialty metals products business that was previously in the Handset Products division is now included within the Performance Materials division.
Following the reorganisation there is no longer a Handset Products division.
Following these changes, the reportable segments for 2010 are as follows: Performance Materials designs and supplies a range of EMI shielding materials, thermal management solutions and signal integrity products to a wide variety of electronic devices.
Wireless Systems designs and supplies a range of high specification wireless antennae, and machinetomachine M2M wireless modules for a number of markets including infrastructure and automotive markets.
Mechanisms designs and supplies a range of mechanical actuation devices for mobile phone handsets.
A segmental analysis has been prepared on the same basis as included in the 2009 Report and Accounts, which can be found at note 36 on page109.
Revenue from one customer of the Performance Materials division, Wireless Systems division and Mechanisms represents approximately 94m 2009, 190m of the Groups total revenues.
Revenue from a second customer represents 84m 2009, 53m of the Groups total revenues.
Unallocated costs are central costs related to managing the parent company.
Unallocated assets in the above table include assets for cash, retirement benefits and other debtors.
Laird PLC 77 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 3 Segmental analysis continued Unallocated liabilities other in the above table include liabilities for current tax, deferred tax, retirement benefits, dividends, provisions and other creditors.
Geographic information The Group managed its business segments on a global basis and the parent company is resident in the UK.
The Groups operations are based in the following territories: North America, Europe, Asia and Rest of World.
The revenue analysis in the table below is based on the location of the customer.
The analysis of noncurrent assets is based on the location of the assets and for this purpose consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

82 Laird PLC 13 Earnings per share The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the loss for the year divided by the daily average of the number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the same loss but with the number of shares increased to reflect the daily average eff ect of relevant share options granted but not yet exercised where performance conditions have been met and shares contingently issuable.

Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits.
The total amount of research and development activity incurred during 2010 is 42.2m 2009, 42.8m of which 9.5m 2009, 11.1m was capitalised.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for assessment of impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
No impairment to goodwill was identified.
Goodwill was tested for impairment for the following cash generating units CGUs : Performance Materials division Wireless Systems division excluding the Antennae Systems business Antennae Systems business All goodwill relating to the Mechanisms business was written off during the year.
Laird PLC 87 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 17 Intangible assets continued Performance Materials had a goodwill balance of 212.2m at the year end 2009, 206.8m.
Wireless Systems excluding Antennae Systems had a goodwill balance of 146.0m at the year end 2009, 117.2m.
Antennae Systems had a goodwill balance of 123.1m at the year end 2009, 118.5m.
Mechanisms had a goodwill balance of nil at the year end 2009, 8.0m.
All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
The key assumptions were: A pretax discount rate of 9.6% 2009, 10.5% Revenue growth rates for each CGU were based on relevant external market estimates and management knowledge.
The discount rate has been applied to cash flow forecasts for 2011 to perpetuity.
The forecast cash flows for 2011 are based on what has been approved internally by the Board for the 2011 budget.
Revenue estimates which underpin the forecasts for 20122015, have been based on external market estimates for handsets, PCs and Telecoms but after reflecting Managements views of average selling prices, product penetration trends and their impact on the size of the addressable market.
Cash flows for 2015 onwards for all three divisions have been increased by 3% per annum 2009, 3% per annum.
Downside sensitivities have been applied to the cash flow estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the carrying value of the assets and provide further comfort that no impairment is required.
Performance Materials has the greatest amount of headroom and Antennae Systems the least.
Revenues would have to be some 14% less than forecast for each period before some form of impairment would have to be considered.
Other acquired intangible assets Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets: Brand names 5 years Trade secrets 8 to 15 years Trade marks and names 5 to 15 years Patents the remaining duration of the 17 year legal right Licence the remaining duration of the 20 year legal right Customer relationships 10 to 20 years The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the customer to continue business with the Group for any finite period.
Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible assets with an indefinite life.
88 Laird PLC 18 Business combinations Acquisition of businesses in 2010 On 22 November 2010, Cattron Group International, Inc. which designs, develops and manufactures wireless controlled automation systems, was acquired for a total consideration of 55.5m.
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition and all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The fair values are provisional due to the acquisition being completed close to the year end.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Book and fair values of the net assets of the business acquired, stated at rates of exchange at the date of acquisition, were as follows: Provisional fair values Book to the values Group m m Property, plant and equipment 1.4 1.4 Intangible assets 2.4 37.6 Deferred tax assets 0.8 Inventories 4.7 4.7 Trade and other receivables 5.9 5.9 Income tax recoverable 0.7 0.7 Trade and other payables 5.3 5.3 Income tax payable 0.6 1.5 Deferred tax liabilities 0.4 14.2 Retirement benefit obligations 0.6 0.6 Provisions 0.3 0.3 Net assets acquired 8.7 28.4 Goodwill arising on acquisition 25.3 Consideration 53.7 Consideration satisfied by: Cash consideration 55.5 Deferred cash consideration Net cash acquired 1.8 53.7 The Group has acquired a 100% interest in the acquisition noted above.
Underlying profits before tax for the entity acquired were 1.2m following acquisition.
If the acquisition had been held for the full year, 2010 revenues would have been 32.3m higher, at 599.7m and the loss before tax would have been 4.0m lower, at 4.6m.
Profit before tax for the entity acquired following acquisition on an IFRS basis was 0.9m.
Included in the 25.3m of goodwill recognised above are certain assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies.
Details of the Groups significant subsidiaries are disclosed in the list of Principal subsidiaries on page111.
Acquisition of businesses in 2009 There were no acquisitions in 2009.

c The Group had committed bilateral revolving bank loan facilities of 265m which were underwritten in excess of one year.
Drawings by Group companies under these facilities were 62.8m 2009, nil.
Although these drawings are repayable within one year they are classified as long term as they can be refinanced under the terms of the facilities.

Laird PLC 93 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 25 Deferred taxes continued Unrecognised tax losses Deferred tax assets have not been established on trading losses of 20.4m 2009, 14.4m where it is unlikely that future relief would be available at the balance sheet date.
Of these losses, 8.6m 2009, 3.6m have expiry dates between 2010 and 2029 and 11.8m 2009, 10.8m are available indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on other deductible temporary diff erences of 23.8m 2009, 22.4m where their use is restricted indefinitely.
Temporary diff erences associated with Group investments Deferred tax of 1.1m 2009, 1.3m has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where it is likely there will be income tax consequences attached to the payment of dividends.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on temporary diff erences of 42.9m 2009, 29.7m relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary diff erences and it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary diff erences at 31 December 2010 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
Factors aff ecting future tax charges A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
The UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 27% eff ective 1 April 2011 and disclosure of deferred tax has been adjusted to reflect the enactment of the revised rate but with no significant impact on these financial statements.
The June 2010 Budget also announced subsequent reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 24% by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are not included in these financial statements.
The company expects the impact of these changes to the financial statements will be negligible.

The forward contracts have a principal value of 16.0m 2009, 33.7m and are mainly denominated in US dollar, Euro and Swedish krona.
These contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the increase in fair value during 2010 of 1.2m 2009, 2.1m increase has been taken to the income statement.
96 Laird PLC 28 Financial instruments continued Interest rate and currency profile The Groups policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs.
At 31 December 2010 approximately 59 per cent of debt is at fixed rate.
This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
Interest rate risk The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
The interest rates considered are Sterling and US dollar, being the currencies in which the Group have historically issued debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all nonderivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes those recognised at fair value as well as all nonderivative floating rate financial instruments.
Where the Group has taken out fixed to variable interest rate swaps, the impact from changes in interest rates is also included for the purpose of the sensitivity analysis.
Eff ect on profit before tax m 2010 50 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 0.3 50 basis points increase in sterling interest rates A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite eff ect.
2009 50 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 50 basis points increase in sterling interest rates A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite eff ect.
Credit risk Lairds customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal products with customers who themselves have significant market shares.
Inevitably this results in levels of business and trade receivables that are material in the overall Group context.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollar, Euro and Renminbi.
The Group policy is to match out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then hedge out the residual exposures.
Laird PLC 97 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 28 Financial instruments continued The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against sterling with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency contracts and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of forward currency hedges and net investment hedges.
Eff ect on profit Eff ect on before tax equity m m 2010 10% appreciation of the US dollar 7.5 15.0 10% appreciation of the Euro 0.4 10% appreciation of the Renminbi 1.5 2009 10% appreciation of the US dollar 6.2 9.7 10% appreciation of the Euro 0.2 10% appreciation of the Renminbi 0.2 A 10% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite eff ect.
Net investment hedging Included in borrowings are US $231.7m of debt which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States subsidiaries.
This is being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.

The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility: average of monthly activity over the last three years.
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome.
Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value.
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers prevesting.

Laird PLC 105 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2010 35 Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
12 employees 2009, 12 are members of two diff erent defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,600 2009, 1,700 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were 0.3m 2009, 0.3m.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2010, at their market value, is estimated at 98.2m 2009, 91.4m and the liabilities estimated at 95.3m 2009, 92.7m.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise pensions surpluses on the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contributions.
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 is 0.1m 2009,2.5m.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension assets and liability under IAS 19 at 31 December were as follows: Schemes Schemes in surplus in surplus with a right Other with a right Other to a refund schemes Total to a refund schemes Total 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 m m m m m m Annuities 8.9 1.1 10.2 9.0 9.0 Equities 35.2 35.2 37.5 37.5 Gilts and bonds 51.5 51.5 44.8 44.8 Other including cash 1.5 1.5 0.1 0.1 Total market value of assets 97.1 1.1 98.2 91.4 91.4 Present value of scheme liabilities 88.6 6.7 95.3 87.9 4.8 92.7 Funded status 8.5 5.6 2.9 3.5 4.8 1.3 Disallowed assets 3.0 3.0 1.2 1.2 Surplus deficit in the schemes 5.5 5.6 0.1 2.3 4.8 2.5 The expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.4% per annum 2009, 4.7% and those for equities at 8.1% per annum 2009, 8.2%.
The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long term real rates of return from the main asset classes.
For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in the markets for these assets has been assumed.
For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been assumed, to reflect the greater returns anticipated over the long term from a mixture of UK and overseas equities.
106 Laird PLC 35 Retirement benefit obligations continued The mortality assumption used at the 2010 and 2009 year end is based on 92 series tables with an allowance for improvements in line with the medium cohort based on each members year of birth, subject to a minimum level of future improvement of 1.5%.
Executive and director members have an age rating of - 1 years and all other members have an age rating of 2 applied to the base table.
The expected lifetime of a participant who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on these mortality tables: Executive and director Other members members Age Males Females Males Females 65 21.2 24.5 24.1 27.4 65 in 15 years 23.3 26.7 26.2 29.5 For IAS 19 the schemes liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation of 3.7% per annum 2009, 3.8%, salary increases of 4.7% 5.7% per annum 2009, 4.8% 5.8% and a discount rate for liabilities of 5.5% per annum 2009, 5.65%.

The directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date of inception of the company schemes to 31 December 2003.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to defined benefit schemes will be 0.4m in 2011.
108 Laird PLC 35 Retirement benefit obligations continued Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme, included within a multiemployer plan, for its employees which is insured with Alecta.
This scheme is a defined benefit scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide suff icient information to report the Groups proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the scheme.
Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Groups proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the scheme.
As a result the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme, although it is actually a defined benefit scheme.
36 Segmental analysis During 2010, Laird changed its organisational structure.
The segmental analysis disclosed in note 3 is on the new basis.
The old basis is disclosed in this note.
The analysis is consistent with the methodology used to allocate costs in note 3.
Laird PLC 109 37 Post balance sheet event On 9 March 2011 the Group acquired Klver Aggregatebau GmbH, a German based designer and supplier of thermal management active cooling systems for medical equipment, for a cash consideration of 25.0m 21.0m on a debt and cash free basis.
The disclosure of further financial information in the financial statements is impracticable because of the timing of the acquisition.
