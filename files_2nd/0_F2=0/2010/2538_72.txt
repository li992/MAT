Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 26. financial RisK manaGement obJectives and policies overview The groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements and share price exposure arising under the groups employee incentive schemes.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the groups operations include trade receivables and payables see notes 19 and 25 respectively.
It is, and has always been, the groups policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Additionally, the group is exposed to commodity price risk and share price risk.
The board of directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
interest rate risk The groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the groups long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The groups policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The groups policy is to keep between 25% and 80% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest over a three year time horizon.
To manage this, the group enters into interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements which are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 3 October 2010, after taking into account the effect of these instruments, approximately 63% of the groups borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest 2009: 62%.
interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the groups loss before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings and equity for changes in the fair values of applicable derivative instruments.

The group has operations in euro-denominated countries and finances these partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings and cross currency swaps which hedge the net investment in foreign operations.
Additionally cash generation from euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge.
The group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials and capital expenditure in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual group entities.
Such purchases are made in the currencies of US dollars and euros.
As at 3 October 2010, the group has hedged 68% 2009: 48% of forecast net exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the group, cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert the cash flows to the required currency.
These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the underlying borrowing.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and euro exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the groups loss before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities and the groups equity due to changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts.

It is the groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount disclosed in note 19.
For transactions that do not occur in the country of the relevant operating unit, the group does not offer credit terms without the approval of the Head of Finance Shared Services.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
The group maintains a policy on counterparty credit exposures with banks and financial institutions arising from the use of derivatives and financial instruments.
This policy restricts the investment of surplus funds and entering into derivatives to counterparties with a minimum credit rating maintained by either Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch.
The level of exposure with counterparties at various ratings levels is also restricted under this policy.
The level of exposure and the credit worthiness of the groups banking counterparties is reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
commodity price risk The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being PET, sugar, cans and frozen concentrated orange juice.
Where it is considered commercially advantageous, the group enters into fixed price contracts with suppliers to hedge against unfavourable commodity price changes.
share schemes equity price risk The group operates several employee incentive share schemes.
It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares are purchased in the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan.
To hedge this risk the group has entered into a number of total return share swaps against schemes maturing in 2010, 2011 and 2012. liquidity risk The group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using rolling cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts consider the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable, other financial assets and projected cash flows from operations.
The objective of the groups liquidity policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and flexibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts and long term private placement issuance.
The bank loans entered into by the group are unsecured.
At 3 October 2010, none of the groups debt will mature in less than one year 2009: 0% based on the carrying value of borrowings reflected in the financial statements.

Details with regard to derivative contracts are included in note 27. fair value hierarchy The group uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the group to grow, whilst operating with sufficient headroom within its bank covenants.
The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt EBITDA ratio.
Net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing loans and borrowings and the element of the fair value of interest rate cross currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the US private placement Notes.
The net debt EBITDA ratio enables the group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.
The group believes that a net debt EBITDA ratio in the range of 2.0 3.0 provides an efficient capital structure and an appropriate level of financial flexibility.
At 3 October 2010 the net debt EBITDA ratio was 2.4 2009: 2.4.
