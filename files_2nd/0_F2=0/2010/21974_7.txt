Related party transactions The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of BT Group Investments Limited, which is the immediate parent company.
BT Group Investments Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of the ultimate holding company and controlling entity, BT Group plc.
Copies of the ultimate holding companys financial statements may be obtained from The Secretary, BT Group plc, 81 Newgate Street, London EC1A 7AJ.
The results of the company are included in the consolidated financial statements of BT Group plc.
Consequently, the company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8, Related Party Disclosures, from disclosing details of transactions and balances with BT Group plc, fellow subsidiaries and associated undertakings, and other companies which are deemed to be under common control.
Financial commitments and contingent liabilities 2010 2009 At 31 March m m Contracts placed for capital expenditure not provided in the accounts 368 433 Operating lease payments payable within one year of the balance sheet date were in respect of leases expiring: Within one year 22 22 Between one and five years 123 136 After five years 340 345 Total payable within one year 485 503 Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings which arose from a sale and operating leaseback transaction in a prior period.
Leases have an average term of 22 years 2009: 23 years and rentals are xed for an average of 22 years 2009: 23 years.
At 31 March 2010, other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O UK Limited prior to its demerger with O on 19 November 2 2 2001.
O plc has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure was US$132m as at 31 March 2010 2009: 2 US$110m, approximately 87m 2009: 77m, although this could increase by a further US$304m 2009: US$399m, approximately 200m 2009: 278m, in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O UK 2 Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
We do not believe that there is any single current court action that would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operations of the group.
However the aggregate volume and value of legal actions to which the group is party has increased signicantly during 2010.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS universal mobile telecommunication system auction in 2000.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor.
All the other defendants were also acquitted.
The Public Prosecutor has appealed the courts decision.
The appeal was unsuccessful and no damages follow.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK Government set the rates payable on BTs infrastructure and those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether or not the UK Government complied with European Community Treaty rules on state aid.
The Commission concluded in October 2006 that no state aid had been granted.
The Commissions decision was appealed.
Judgement on the appeal has not yet been given but we continue to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless and that the appeal will not succeed.

Retirement benets Background The company offers retirement benefit plans to its employees.
The companys main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 when it was replaced by a dened contribution scheme, the BT Retirement Plan BTRP which was closed on 31 March 2009.
On 1 April 2009 BT set up the BT Retirement Savings Scheme, a contract based dened contribution arrangement, to which BTRP members were invited to transfer their accumulated assets.
The total pension cost of the company for 2010 included within staff costs was 267m 2009: 500m.
The total cost relating to the BTPS was 200m 2009: 455m, of which 198m 2009: 451m was borne by the company.
An element of the total charge relating to the BTPS is recharged to fellow subsidiary undertakings who are participating employers in the pension scheme.
The company retains the full liability of the BTPS.
Dened contribution schemes The profit and loss charge in respect of dened contribution schemes represents the contribution payable by the company based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The pension cost for 2010 in respect of the companys main dened contribution scheme was 65m 2009: 47m and 6m 2009: 4m of contributions were outstanding at 31 March 2010.
Dened benefit schemes BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed of the BTPS, there are nine Trustee directors appointed by the company, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including the Chairman of the Trustee.
Four Trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the Trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the company, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the Trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, alternative assets, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, the schemes assets did not include any ordinary shares of the ultimate parent company, BT Group plc.
However, the scheme held 52m 2009: 65m of bonds and 6m 2009: 5m of index-linked notes issued by the company.
The company occupies four 2009: two properties owned by the BTPS on which an annual rental of 0.2m is payable 2009: 0.1m.
