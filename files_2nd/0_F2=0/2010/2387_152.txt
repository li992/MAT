For all other financial instruments, the carrying amount is either the fair value, or approximates the fair value.
Financial risk factors The group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including: market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The group financial risk committee GFRC advises the group chief financial officer CFO who oversees the management of these risks.
The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the group treasurer and the heads of the finance, tax and the integrated supply and trading functions.
The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group.
The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the group chief executive GCE, and via the GCE to the board, that the groups financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.
The groups trading activities in the oil, natural gas and power markets are managed within the integrated supply and trading function, while the activities in the financial markets are managed by the integrated supply and trading function, on behalf of the treasury function.
All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision.
These teams are subject to close financial and management control.
The integrated supply and trading function maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk associated with trading activity.
These processes meet generally accepted industry practice and reflect the principles of the Group of Thirty Global Derivatives Study recommendations.
A policy and risk committee monitors and validates limits and risk exposures, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologies and procedures.
A commitments committee approves value-at-risk delegations, the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.
In addition, the integrated supply and trading function undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a separate control framework as described more fully below.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2010 185 Notes on financial statements 27.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued a Market risk Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business.
The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The group enters into derivatives in a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation.
In addition, the group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its natural business exposures.
In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.
The group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions using value-at-risk techniques.
For 2010, the various value-at-risk models used in prior years were consolidated as part of a process simplification into a Monte Carlo framework.
This makes a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding period.
The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures and the history of one-day price movements, together with the correlation of these price movements.
The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing.
The value-at-risk table does not incorporate any of the groups natural business exposures or any derivatives entered into to risk manage those exposures.
The results of the gas price trading are included within Exploration and Production segment results, and the gas price trading value-at-risk includes gas and power trading.
The results of the oil price trading are included within Refining and Marketing segment results, and the oil price trading value-at-risk includes oil, interest rate and currency trading.
Market risk exposure in respect of embedded derivatives is also not included in the value-at-risk table.
Instead separate sensitivity analyses are disclosed below.
Value-at-risk limits are in place for each trading activity and for the groups trading activity in total.
The board has delegated a limit of $100 million value at risk in support of this trading activity.
The high and low values at risk indicated in the table below for each type of activity are independent of each other.
Through the portfolio effect the high value at risk for the group as a whole is lower than the sum of the highs for the constituent parts.
The potential movement in fair values is expressed to a 95% confidence interval.
This means that, in statistical terms, one would expect to see a decrease in fair values greater than the trading value at risk on one occasion per month if the portfolio were left unchanged.

i Commodity price risk The groups integrated supply and trading function uses conventional financial and commodity instruments and physical cargoes available in the related commodity markets.
Oil and natural gas swaps, options and futures are used to mitigate price risk.
Power trading is undertaken using a combination of over-the-counter forward contracts and other derivative contracts, including options and futures.
This activity is on both a standalone basis and in conjunction with gas derivatives in relation to gas-generated power margin.
In addition, NGLs are traded around certain US inventory locations using over-the-counter forward contracts in conjunction with over-the-counter swaps, options and physical inventories.
Trading value-at-risk information in relation to these activities is shown in the table above.
As described above, the group also carries out risk management of certain natural business exposures using over-the-counter swaps and exchange futures contracts.
Together with certain physical supply contracts that are classified as derivatives, these contracts fall outside of the value-at-risk framework.
For these derivative contracts the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 10% increase or decrease in all reference prices would have been $104 million at 31 December 2010 2009 $73 million.
This figure does not include any corresponding economic benefit or disbenefit that would arise from the natural business exposure which would be expected to offset the gain or loss on the over-the-counter swaps and exchange futures contracts mentioned above.
In addition, the group has embedded derivatives relating to certain natural gas contracts.
The net fair value of these contracts was a liability of $1,607 million at 31 December 2010 2009 liability of $1,331 million.
Key information on the natural gas contracts is given below.
At 31 December 2010 2009 Remaining contract terms 4 years and 5 months to 7 years and 9 months 9 months to 8 years 9 months Contractual notional amount 1,688 million therms 2,460 million therms For these embedded derivatives the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 10% favourable or adverse change in the key assumptions is as follows.

Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The sensitivities for risk management activity and embedded derivatives are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance.
In addition, for the purposes of this analysis, in the above table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the embedded derivatives is calculated independently of any change in another assumption.
In reality, changes in one factor may contribute to changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Furthermore, the estimated fair values as disclosed should not be considered indicative of future earnings on these contracts.
ii Foreign currency exchange risk Where the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-at-risk techniques as explained above.
This activity is included within oil price trading in the value-at-risk table above.
Since BP has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have significant effects on the groups reported results.
The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions.
For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the groups reported results.
The main underlying economic currency of the groups cash flows is the US dollar.
This is because BPs major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars.
BPs foreign currency exchange management policy is to minimize economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar.
The group co-ordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible, and then dealing with any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.
The group manages these exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $200 million.
At 31 December 2010, the foreign currency value at risk was $81 million 2009 $140 million.
At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit.
The most significant exposures relate to capital expenditure commitments and other UK and European operational requirements, for which a hedging programme is in place and hedge accounting is claimed as outlined in Note 34.
For highly probable forecast capital expenditures the group locks in the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards and futures.
The main exposures are sterling, euro, Norwegian krone, Australian dollar, Korean won and Singapore dollar and at 31 December 2010 open contracts were in place for $989 million sterling, $115 million euro, $212 million Norwegian krone and $143 million Australian dollar capital expenditures maturing within five years, with over 80% of the deals maturing within two years 2009 $800 million sterling, $491 million Canadian dollar, $299 million euro, $240 million Norwegian krone, $215 million Australian dollar, $51 million Korean won and $41 million Singapore dollar capital expenditures maturing within six years with over 65% of the deals maturing within two years.
For other UK, European, Canadian and Australian operational requirements the group uses cylinders and currency forwards to hedge the estimated exposures on a 12-month rolling basis.
At 31 December 2010, the open positions relating to cylinders consisted of receive sterling, pay US dollar, purchased call and sold put options cylinders for $1,340 million 2009 $1,887 million : receive euro, pay US dollar cylinders for $650 million 2009 $1,716 million : receive Australian dollar, pay US dollar cylinders for $286 million 2009 $297 million.
At 31 December 2010 the open positions relating to currency forwards consisted of buy sterling, sell US dollar currency forwards for $925 million 2009 nil : buy Euro, sell US dollar currency forwards for $630 million 2009 nil : and buy Canadian dollar, sell US dollar, currency forwards for $162 million 2009 nil.
In addition, most of the groups borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar.
At 31 December 2010, the total foreign currency net borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $652 million 2009 $465 million.
Of this total, $125 million was denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual operating unit being entirely Canadian dollars 2009 $113 million, being entirely Canadian dollars.
It is estimated that a 10% change in the corresponding exchange rates would result in an exchange gain or loss in the income statement of $12 million 2009 $11 million.
iii Interest rate risk Where the group enters into money market contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using value-at-risk techniques as described above.
BP is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt.
While the group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the debt to a floating rate exposure, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt.
The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2010 was 67% of total finance debt outstanding 2009 63%.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2010 is 2% 2009 2% and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt is five years 2009 four years.
The groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate element of the groups finance debt.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments were to have increased by 1% on 1 January 2011, it is estimated that the groups profit before taxation for 2011 would decrease by approximately $303 million 2009 $219 million decrease in 2010.
This assumes that the amount and mix of fixed and floating rate debt, including finance leases, remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2010 and that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the year.
Where the interest rate applicable to an instrument is reset during a quarter it is assumed that this occurs at the beginning of the quarter and remains unchanged for the rest of the year.
In reality, the fixed floating rate mix will fluctuate over the year and interest rates will change continually.
Furthermore, the effect on earnings shown by this analysis does not consider the effect of any other changes in general economic activity that may accompany such an increase in interest rates.
iv Equity price risk The group holds equity investments, typically made for strategic purposes, that are classified as non-current available-for-sale financial assets and are measured initially at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income.
Accumulated fair value changes are recycled to the income statement on disposal, or when the investment is impaired.
No impairment losses have been recognized in 2010 2009 nil and 2008 $546 million relating to listed non-current available-for-sale investments.
For further information see Note 28.
At 31 December 2010, it is estimated that an increase of 10% in quoted equity prices would result in an immediate credit to other comprehensive income of $95 million 2009 $130 million credit to other comprehensive income, whilst a decrease of 10% in quoted equity prices would result in an immediate charge to other comprehensive income of $95 million 2009 $130 million charge to other comprehensive income.
BP has derivative positions that result in opposite impacts such that a 10% increase in equity prices would result in a charge to profit or loss of $70 million 2009 nil and a 10% decrease in equity prices would result in a gain to profit or loss of $67 million 2009 nil.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2010 187 Notes on financial statements 27.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued At 31 December 2010, a single equity investment made up 80% 2009 73% of the carrying amount of non-current available-for-sale financial assets thus the groups exposure is concentrated on changes in the share price of this equity in particular.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables.
The group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO, that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk.
Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business.
On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered.
Key requirements of the policy are formal delegated authorities to the sales and marketing teams to incur credit risk and to a specialized credit function to set counterparty limits: the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that counterparties are rated and limits set: and systems to monitor exposure against limits and report regularly on those exposures, and immediately on any excesses, and to track and report credit losses.
The treasury function provides a similar credit risk management activity with respect to group-wide exposures to banks and other financial institutions.
While the global credit environment showed signs of stabilization and improvement in 2010, economic and political uncertainties continue to drive heightened awareness, discussion and co-ordination around the credit risks arising from the groups activities.
Before trading with a new counterparty can start, its creditworthiness is assessed and a credit rating is allocated that indicates the probability of default, along with a credit exposure limit.
The assessment process takes into account all available qualitative and quantitative information about the counterparty and the group, if any, to which the counterparty belongs.
The counterpartys business activities, financial resources and business risk management processes are taken into account in the assessment, to the extent that this information is publicly available or otherwise disclosed to BP by the counterparty, together with external credit ratings.
Creditworthiness continues to be evaluated after transactions have been initiated and a watchlist of higher-risk counterparties is maintained.
The group does not aim to remove credit risk but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses.
The group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract on the occurrence of certain events of default.
Depending on the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the group may require collateral or other credit enhancements such as cash deposits or letters of credit and parent company guarantees.
Trade receivables and payables, and derivative assets and liabilities, are presented on a net basis where unconditional netting arrangements are in place with counterparties and where there is an intent to settle amounts due on a net basis.
The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount.
At 31 December 2010, the maximum credit exposure was $60,643 million 2009 $49,575 million.
Collateral received and recognized in the balance sheet at the year end was $313 million 2009 $549 million and collateral held off balance sheet was $52 million 2009 $48 million.
Credit exposure exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2010 were $404 million 2009 $319 million in respect of liabilities of jointly controlled entities and associates and $664 million 2009 $667 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
Notwithstanding the processes described above, significant unexpected credit losses can occasionally occur.
Exposure to unexpected losses increases with concentrations of credit risk that exist when a number of counterparties are involved in similar activities or operate in the same industry sector or geographical area, which may result in their ability to meet contractual obligations being impacted by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
The groups principal customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which it conducts business are located throughout the world.
In addition, these risks are managed by maintaining a group watchlist and aggregating multi-segment exposures to ensure that a material credit risk is not missed.
Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the groups overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.
The reports also include details of the largest counterparties by exposure level and expected loss, and details of counterparties on the group watchlist.
Some mitigation of credit exposure is achieved by: netting arrangements: credit support agreements which require the counterparty to provide collateral or other credit risk mitigation: and credit insurance and other risk transfer instruments.
For the contracts comprising derivative financial instruments in an asset position at 31 December 2010, it is estimated that over 80% 2009 over 80% of the unmitigated credit exposure is to counterparties of investment grade credit quality.
For cash and cash equivalents, the treasury function dynamically manages bank deposit limits to ensure cash is well-diversified and to avoid concentration risks.
At 31 December 2010, over 80% of the cash and cash equivalents balance was deposited with financial institutions rated A or higher.
Trade and other receivables of the group are analysed in the table below.
By comparing the BP credit ratings to the equivalent external credit ratings, it is estimated that approximately 50-60% 2009 approximately 55-60% of the unmitigated trade receivables portfolio exposure is of investment grade credit quality.
With respect to the trade and other receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.
The group does not typically renegotiate the terms of trade receivables: however, if a renegotiation does take place, the outstanding balance is included in the analysis based on the original payment terms.
There were no significant renegotiated balances outstanding at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009.

Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The movement in the valuation allowance for trade receivables is set out below.

The groups liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function.
Unless restricted by local regulations, subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to treasury, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the groups overall net currency positions.
Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the group faced significant challenges in managing liquidity risk.
The group was required to make substantial cash payments in connection with the oil spill and also experienced increased requirements during the year to post letters of credit to collateralize a number of environmental liabilities totalling $624 million and post further cash collateral under trading agreements totalling $728 million.
Further informaton is provided in Liquidity and capital resources on pages 63 to 67.
In managing its liquidity risk, the group has access to a wide range of funding at competitive rates through capital markets and banks.
The groups treasury function centrally co-ordinates relationships with banks, borrowing requirements, foreign exchange requirements and cash management.
The group believes it has access to sufficient funding through its own current cash holdings and future cash generation including disposal proceeds, the commercial paper markets, and by using undrawn committed borrowing facilities, to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements.
At 31 December 2010, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, including committed facilities of $12,500 million 2009 $4,950 million, consisting of $5,250 million of standby facilities of which $400 million is available to draw and repay by mid-September 2011, $4,550 million until mid-October 2011, and $300 million until mid-January 2013 and $7,250 million of 364-day facilities of which $4,000 million can be drawn until late May 2011 and is repayable up to 364 days from the date of drawing, $2,000 million drawn until the end of June 2011, $750 million drawn until early July 2011, and $500 million drawn until late August 2011.
These facilities are with a number of international banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group has in place a European Debt Issuance Programme DIP under which the group may raise up to $20 billion of debt for maturities of one month or longer.
At 31 December 2010, the amount drawn down against the DIP was $12,272 million 2009 $11,403 million.
In addition, the group has in place an unlimited US Shelf Registration under which it may raise debt with maturities of one month or longer.
The group has long-term debt ratings of A2 stable outlook assigned by Moodys and A negative outlook assigned by Standard & Poors, a downgrading from Aa1 stable outlook and AA stable outlook, respectively assigned prior to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Since the credit rating downgrading, we have issued $6.2 billion of long-term debt early in the fourth quarter 2010, and issued short-term commercial paper at competitive rates, as and when required.
As an additional measure, we have increased and maintained the cash and cash equivalents held by the group to $18.6 billion at the end of 2010, compared with $8.3 billion at the end of 2009.
The amounts shown for finance debt in the table below include expected interest payments on borrowings and the future minimum lease payments with respect to finance leases.
Included within current finance debt are US Industrial Revenue Municipal bonds where bondholders have the option to tender the bonds for repayment at interest reset dates, and the next reset date falls within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The amounts at the end of 2010 totalled $379 million, down from $2,895 million at the end of 2009.
The reduction largely reflects the initial failure to re-market the bonds following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, as well as active management by BP to withdraw or re-negotiate term-out of the bonds on reset dates to further remove the uncertainty of the liquidity risk.
Also included within current finance debt at the end of 2009 was an amount of $1,622 million for loans associated with long-term gas supply contracts backed by gas pre-paid bonds with tender options at interest rate resets with BP as the liquidity provider.
Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill the bonds failed re-marketing requiring BP to acquire and hold all of the bonds, with corresponding reduction to nil in the amount reflected in finance debt at the end of 2010.
Current finance debt on the group balance sheet at 31 December 2010 includes $6,197 million 2009 nil in respect of cash deposits received for disposals expected to complete in 2011 which will be considered extinguished on completion of the transactions.
This amount is excluded from the table below.
The table also shows the timing of cash outflows relating to trade and other payables and accruals.
