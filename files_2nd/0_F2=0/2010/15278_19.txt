The key assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGUs activities and geography of operation.
Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with managements expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
A discount rate of 9% has been used in each calculation.
The profit used in the cash flows for the first year is derived from management forecasts: for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is applied.
The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
Growth rates of between 4.0% and 5.0% have been used, representing managements best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the markets concerned.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups Pharma Chemicals division is similar to its carrying value and, consequently, any adverse change in key assumptions would, in isolation, cause an impairment loss to be recognised.
Other than Pharma Chemicals, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

Introduction Business review Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Yule Catto & Co plc Annual report and accounts 2010 61 21 Financial instruments The Groups treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for current and future needs.
The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 20, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in note 26.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: Carrying value Fair values at 31 December at 31 December 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 Fair value of financial assets Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 108,958 94,656 108,958 94,656 Cash and cash equivalents 36,211 42,384 36,211 42,384 Derivatives at fair value 22,765 11,763 22,765 11,763 167,934 148,803 167,934 148,803 Fair value of financial liabilities Loan notes 87,065 116,831 92,775 118,754 Bank loans and overdrafts 25,190 23,199 25,190 23,199 Trade and other payables excluding accruals 117,699 103,664 117,699 103,664 229,954 243,694 235,664 245,617 Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Groups financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk The Groups main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The policies adopted to address these risks are as follows: Interest rate risk T he Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Foreign currency risk T he Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euros.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
T he Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2009 none.
Yule Catto & Co plc 62 Annual report and accounts 2010 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2010 21 Financial instruments continued Impact on income statement Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to 2,644,680 have been credited to the income statement in the year 2009 charge of 4,400,652.
These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting The Group has a number of cross currency and interest rate swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address.
The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39.
It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justified and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
As disclosed in note 29, the Group anticipates making a euro purchase of 443 million in respect of the pending acquisition.
To the extent that this will be funded out of sterling resources, the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the sterling value of a percentage of this anticipated euro purchase.
These contracts have been accounted for as cash flow hedges as permitted by IAS 39.
In addition the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contract to fix the sterling value of its net investments in certain foreign operations, which have a euro functional currency.
These contracts have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted by IAS 39.
Interest rate risk profile Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2010 was: Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 37,668 40,000 77,668 2,223 105,000 107,223 Euro 3,404 3,404 4,693 4,693 US dollar 97 97 14 14 Other 18,412 18,412 18,492 18,492 59,581 40,000 99,581 25,422 105,000 130,422 Cash and cash equivalents 36,211 42,384 Net borrowings underlying performance 63,370 88,038 The effective interest rate for the year was 4.8% 2009 6.9%.
Sensitivity analysis T he following table illustrates the effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in UK and US interest rates and in euro and US dollar to sterling exchange rates, before the effect of tax.

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Yule Catto & Co plc had the following principal facilities: A committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 30 million.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately 75 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004.
With maturity between 2012 and 2016, these loan notes provide the Groups long-term requirements.

Executive share option schemes Details of the share option schemes available to senior management are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 33.
For grants made after 7 November 2002, the charge to profit is calculated on the assumption that, given that the exercise price is effectively nil, the share price at grant provides a reasonable estimate of the option value at grant.
For grants made before 7 November 2002, the charge to profit is based on the anticipated cash cost of acquiring shares to meet the options exercised.
