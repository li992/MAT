FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 27.
Financial commitments and contingent liabilities 2010 2009 Capital expenditure contracted for at the balance sheet date but not yet incurred was as follows: m m Property, plant and equipment 368 414 Computer software 15 37 Total 383 451 2010 2009 Future minimum operating lease payments for the group were as follows: m m Payable in the year ending 31 March: 2010 484 2011 494 455 2012 460 430 2013 431 403 2014 400 377 2015 375 356 Thereafter 5,527 5,499 Total future minimum operating lease payments 7,687 8,004 Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings which arose from a sale and operating leaseback transaction in a prior period.
Leases have an average term of 22 years 2009: 23 years and rentals are xed for an average of 22 years 2009: 23 years.
At 31 March 2010, other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001.
O2 plc has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure was US$132m as at 31 March 2010 2009: US$110m, approximately 87m 2009: 77m, although this could increase by a further US$304m 2009: US$399m, approximately 200m 2009: 278m, in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
We do not believe that there is any single current court action that would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operations of the group.
However the aggregate volume and value of legal actions to which the group is party has increased signicantly during 2010.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS universal mobile telecommunication system auction in 2000.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor.
All the other defendants were also acquitted.
The Public Prosecutor has appealed the courts decision.
The appeal was unsuccessful and no damages follow.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK Government set the rates payable on BTs infrastructure and those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether or not the UK Government complied with European Community Treaty rules on state aid.
The Commission concluded in October 2006 that no state aid had been granted.
The Commissions decision was appealed.
Judgement on the appeal has not yet been given but we continue to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless and that the appeal will not succeed.
