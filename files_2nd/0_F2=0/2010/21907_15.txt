Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted is set out below.
a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts, issued in January 2009 by The Association of Investment Companies AIC, except as disclosed in the following paragraph.
Expenses which are allocated to capital are available to reduce the Companys liability to corporation tax.
The SORP recommends that the benefit of that tax relief should be allocated to capital and a corresponding charge made to revenue.
This is known as the marginal method of allocating tax relief between capital and revenue.
The Company does not adopt the marginal method for two reasons.
Firstly, the Company has only one class of share and any allocation of tax relief between capital and revenue would have no impact on shareholders funds.
Secondly, the significant unutilised management expenses and interest carried forward make it unlikely that the Company will be liable to corporation tax in the foreseeable future.
Had this allocation been made, the charge to revenue and corresponding credit to capital for the year ended 30 September 2010 would have been 348,000 2009: 1,862,000. b Investments Investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised on a trade date basis.
Listed investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors at their fair value on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
c Capital reserve The following are accounted for in this reserve: realised and unrealised exchange differences on transactions of a capital nature: realised and unrealised exchange differences on forward foreign currency contracts: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increase and decrease in the valuation of investments held at the year end: special dividends of a capital nature: expenses and finance costs charged to capital as set out in the policies below: and cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation.
d Income Dividends are recognised as income on the date which the related investments are marked ex-dividend.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on an accruals basis.
Other investment income, underwriting commission and deposit interest are also recognised on an accruals basis.
Special dividends of a revenue nature are recognised through the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, an amount equal to the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 33 Notes to the Accounts continued e Deferred taxation Where the year in which tax deductable expenditure is incurred differs from the year in which tax relief for the expenditure is given, the amount of the tax relief is known as deferred tax.
Since the management expenses incurred by the Company in the year under review exceed its profits liable to UK corporation tax see note 6 b, the tax relief attributable to the excess expenses, which can be carried forward to future years, is a deferred tax asset.
However, in accordance with UK GAAP, that deferred tax asset has not been recognised in these accounts, since it is unlikely that, in future years, the Company will receive sufficient profits liable to UK corporation tax against which the brought forward expenses can be set.
f Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are all allocated to revenue with the exception of management fees which are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
Performance fees, which derive predominantly by virtue of the Companys capital performance, are charged 100 per cent to capital.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are taken to the Income Statement as a capital item.
g Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an effective yield basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
h Dividends Dividends paid are calculated on an amount per share as approved by the Board of Directors and are recognised in the financial statements when they are paid.
i Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Capital Reserve or Revenue Reserve depending on the nature of the gain or loss.

FCIB receives a basic quarterly fee, payable in advance, equal to 0.075 per cent of the value of Companys total assets less current liabilities excluding loans.
FCIB also receives a performance-related fee calculated on an annual basis by reference to the performance of the Company against the benchmark index over each 12 month period ended on 30 September.
If the Companys net asset value total return for any such period exceeds the total return from the benchmark index, a performance-related fee is payable, on a sliding scale, at a rate of up to 0.3 per cent per annum of the value of equity shareholders funds at the end of the period, depending on the level of outperformance.
The maximum rate of performance-related fee is earned when the outperformance for a 12 month period is 3.0 per cent or more.
The contract between the Company and FCIB may be terminated at any time by either party giving six months notice of termination.
In the event of the Company terminating the contract by giving less than six months notice, FCIB is entitled to compensation calculated as a proportion of the fees payable by the Company in respect of the previous financial year prorated to the date of termination.
Basic investment management fees are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital.
Performance fees are charged 100 per cent to capital.
As a result of the European Court of Justice decision in 2007 that investment management fees payable by investment trusts are not, and should never have been, liable to value added tax VAT, the Company recovered an amount of 1,565,000 during the year ended 30 September 2009 from FCIB in respect of VAT paid on investment management fees in previous years.
The amounts recovered were recognised in the Income Statement and, where applicable, allocated between revenue and capital in the same ratio as the VAT originally suffered.
The Company also received interest of 923,000 during the year ended 30 September 2009 in respect of the VAT recoveries see note 2.

6 a Tax on ordinary activities 2010 2009 000 000 Overseas taxation 353 293 The Company had 43,759,000 unutilised management expenses and interest at 30 September 2010 2009: 42,110,000.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on this amount as it is unlikely that there will be taxable profits from which unused expenses could be deducted.
6 b Reconciliation of tax charge 2010 2009 A reconciliation of the current tax charge is set out below: 000 000 Return on ordinary activities before taxation 41,199 40,757 Corporation tax at standard rate of 28.0 per cent 2009: 28.0 per cent 11,536 11,412 Effects of: Non-taxable capital returns 8,622 7,960 Non-taxable UK dividend income 3,056 3,019 Non-taxable overseas dividend income 781 72 Movement in unutilised management expenses 923 429 Movement in overseas dividends taxable on receipt 68 Overseas tax suffered 353 293 Total current tax charge for the year 353 293 7 Dividends paid 2010 2009 000 000 Amounts paid during the year: third quarterly interim of 1.442p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 2009: 1.40p 4,219 4,097 final of 1.786p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 2009: 1.734p 5,199 5,074 first quarterly interim of 1.442p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2010 2009: 1.442p 4,198 4,219 second quarterly interim of 1.442p per share paid in respect of the year ended 30 September 2010 2009: 1.442p 4,198 4,219 unclaimed dividends from previous years 19 16 17,795 17,593 Proposed third quarterly interim of 1.442p per share in respect of the year ended 30 September 2010 2009: 1.442p 4,198 4,219 Proposed final of 1.786p per share in respect of the year ended 30 September 2010 2009: 1.786p 5,199 5,199 9,397 9,418 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 37 Notes to the Accounts continued 8 Return per share 2010 2009 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total Ordinary 5.0p 9.0p 14.0p 5.8p 8.0p 13.8p The returns per Ordinary Share are based on i a numerator being the returns attributable to shareholders of: 2010 2009 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Ordinary 14,594 26,252 40,846 17,147 23,317 40,464 and ii a denominator being a specific number of shares as follows: 2010 2009 Weighted average number of shares in issue during the year 291,112,282 292,587,264 9 Investments 2010 2009 000 000 Investments listed on a recognised investment exchange 456,891 428,769 Unquoted investments 389 389 Total investments 457,280 429,158 Listed Listed in UK overseas Unquoted Total 000 000 000 000 Opening book cost 287,411 114,136 389 401,936 Opening fair value adjustment 1,355 28,577 27,222 Opening valuation 286,056 142,713 389 429,158 Movements in the year: Purchases at cost 73,910 112,615 186,525 Salesproceeds 54,449 134,425 188,874 losses gains on sales 14,279 22,800 8,521 Increase decrease in fair value adjustment 41,925 19,975 21,950 Closing valuation 333,163 123,728 389 457,280 Closing book cost 292,593 115,126 389 408,108 Closing fair value adjustment 40,570 8,602 49,172 Closing valuation 333,163 123,728 389 457,280 38 British Assets Trust plc 9 Investments continued 2010 2009 000 000 Equity shares 401,201 374,361 Fixed income securities 56,079 54,797 457,280 429,158 Gains losses on investments sold 8,521 72,651 Increase in fair value adjustment 21,950 102,424 Gains on investments 30,471 29,773 The total expenses incurred on the purchase and sale of investments were 549,000 and 351,000 respectively 2009: 832,000 and 552,000.

The Companys capital is represented by the issued share capital, Capital Redemption Reserve, Capital Reserve and Revenue Reserve.
Capital redemption reserve The nominal value of Ordinary Shares bought back for cancellation is added to this reserve.
Capital reserve Items accounted for this reserve are detailed in accounting policy 1 c. Revenue reserve The net profit arising in the revenue column of the Income Statement is added to this reserve.
Dividends paid during the year are deducted from the reserve and it is available for paying future dividends on the Companys shares.

As an investment trust the Company holds a portfolio of financial assets in pursuit of its investment objective.
The Company makes use of borrowings, as detailed in notes 11 and 12 and the Chairmans Statement, to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances held.
Listed fixed asset investments held see note 9 are valued at fair value.
For listed securities this is either bid price or the last traded price depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is listed.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
The market value of the Companys bonds is disclosed on page 43.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the Balance Sheet shown on page 31.
The fair value of the bank loan is not materially different from the carrying value in the Balance Sheet.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movements: ii interest rate risk, being the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: iii credit risk, being the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company: iv liquidity risk, being the risk that the Company may not be able to liquidate its investments quickly enough to meet its ongoing financial commitments: and v foreign currency risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings, investment purchases, investment sales and income will fluctuate because of movements in currency rates.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 41 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued The Company held the following categories of financial instruments as at 30 September 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 000 000 Financial assets Investment portfolio 457,280 429,158 Cash at bank and on deposit 7,002 13,663 Amounts due from brokers 1,928 557 Payments and accrued income 2,436 2,202 VAT related amounts due from investment manager 294 Financial liabilities 6.25 per cent Bonds 2031 59,448 59,421 Revolving advance facility 27,425 27,701 Amounts due to brokers 2,546 1,928 Fee due to investment manager 450 1,049 Bond interest payable 207 207 Other creditors 777 826 Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 14 and 15.
Derivatives may be used from time to time to hedge specific market risk or gain exposure to a specific market.
As at the year end the Company held no exposure to derivatives other than hedged currency exposure as disclosed on page 46.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 20 per cent at 30 September 2010, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been negative 91.5 million 2009: negative 85.8 million.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 20 per cent at 30 September 2010, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been positive 91.5 million 2009: positive 85.8 million.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
The Company held the following categories of financial instruments, all of which are included in the balance sheet at fair value, at 31 September 2010 and 2009: Classification of financial instruments 2010 2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Assets Investment portfolio 456,891 389 457,280 428,769 389 429,158 Foreign exchange currency contracts 191 191 305 305 456,700 389 457,089 428,464 389 428,853 42 British Assets Trust plc 18 Financial instruments continued Level 1 reflects financial instruments quoted in an active market.
Level 2 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
Level 3 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
The Company holds one unquoted investment which is categorised as level 3.
A reconciliation of movements in the year is contained in note 9.
Interest rate risk Floating rate Interest payments are received on cash balances by reference to the bank base rates for the relevant currency for each deposit.

If the bank base rate had decreased by 0.5 per cent, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a profit of 102,000 2009: 70,000.
The calculations are based on the cash balances and the revolving advance facility as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Fixed rate The Company holds fixed interest investments and has fixed interest liabilities.

In the event that the Company decides to repay the bonds before their maturity date the terms of issue may result in a penalty for early repayment.
The fair value of the bonds, based on middle market prices, at 30 September 2010 was 63.5 million 2009: same.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Non-interest bearing investments The Companys non-interest bearing investments are its equity investments which had a value of 401,201,000 as at 30 September 2010 2009: 374,361,000. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represents the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2010 2009 000 000 Fixed income securities 56,079 54,797 Cash at bank and on deposit 7,002 13,663 Balances due from brokers 1,928 557 Interest, dividends and other receivables 2,436 2,496 67,445 71,513 Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small due to the short settlement period involved and the diversity of counterparties used.
All the assets of the Company which are traded on a recognised exchange are held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Board monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports as described in the Report of the Directors on pages 25 and 26.
The Managers have in place a monitoring procedure in respect of counterparty risk which is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is controlled because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings, rated AA or higher, assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions may cause the Companys ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed, limited or lost.
As at 30 September 2010 the Company had two overnight deposits of 1.3 million each 2009: one of 7.6 million with a single counterparty.
There were no other material concentrations of credit risk to counterparties at 30 September 2010 or 30 September 2009 because other deposits were spread over a number of counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Company maintains sufficient investments in cash and readily realisable securities to pay accounts payable and expenses as they fall due.
