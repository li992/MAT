E18 Principal assumptions a Economic assumptions Deterministic calculations Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each reporting period.
In setting the risk-free rate we have, wherever possible, used the mid-price swap yield curve for an AA-rated bank.
The curve is extrapolated if necessary to get rates suitable to the liabilities.
For markets in which there is no reliable swap yield curve the relevant government bond yields are used.
For certain business, swap rates are adjusted for a liquidity premium in deriving the risk-free rates, and these adjustments are shown below the reference rate table.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin or equivalent.
The principal economic assumptions used are as follows: Reference rate spot, swap rates and expense inflation United Kingdom 2010 2009 2008 Reference rate 1 year 1.0% 1.2% 2.8% 5 years 2.7% 3.5% 3.2% 10 years 3.7% 4.3% 3.5% 15 years 4.1% 4.6% 3.8% 20 years 4.2% 4.6% 3.8% Expense inflation 3.3% 3.3% 2.4% Delta Lloyd 2010 2009 2008 Reference rate 1 year 1.3% 1.3% 2.5% 5 years 2.6% 2.9% 3.3% 10 years 3.4% 3.7% 3.8% 15 years 3.8% 4.1% 4.0% 20 years 3.8% 4.2% 3.9% Expense inflation 2.0% 2.4% 2.5% Eurozone excluding Delta Lloyd 2010 2009 2008 Reference rate 1 year 1.3% 1.3% 2.5% 5 years 2.5% 2.8% 3.3% 10 years 3.4% 3.7% 3.8% 15 years 3.8% 4.1% 3.9% 20 years 3.8% 4.2% 3.9% Expense inflation 2.1% 2.5% 2.1% Financial statements MCEV 343 Performance review Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information E18 Principal assumptions continued Poland 2010 2009 2008 Reference rate 1 year 4.4% 4.5% 4.4% 5 years 5.5% 5.8% 4.3% 10 years 5.7% 5.8% 4.2% 15 years 5.4% 5.7% 4.1% 20 years 5.1% 5.5% 4.0% Expense inflation 3.0% 3.0% 2.9% United States 2010 2009 2008 Reference rate 1 year 0.4% 0.7% 1.3% 5 years 2.2% 3.1% 2.2% 10 years 3.5% 4.2% 2.6% 15 years 4.0% 4.6% 2.9% 20 years 4.2% 4.8% 2.9% Expense inflation 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% For service companies, expense inflation relates to the underlying expenses rather than the fees charged to the life company.
The following adjustments are made to the swap rate for immediate annuity type contracts and for all contracts for Aviva USA and for Delta Lloyd.
For Delta Lloyd, the adjustment shown is applied to immediate annuity type contracts.
For participating contracts, 75% of this value is used and for all other contracts, 50% of this value is used.
This methodology is consistent with QIS 5 Solvency II requirements.
For 2010, the approach to estimating the market level of liquidity premium in corporate bond assets has been simplified to use the formula structure proposed by CFO CRO Forum working party.
The formula is: UK Europe: 50% of iBoxx Corporate bond spread 40bp USA: 60% of iBoxx Corporate bond spread 40bp Adjustments are made where liabilities are not fully backed by assets earning a liquidity premium and for contracts that are exposed to some lapse risk.
The revised approach increases the EV by 0.3 billion due to the release of prudent margins in the previous direct Credit Default Swap-based approach.
There has been no change to the types of contracts to which a liquidity premium is applied, apart from in Delta Lloyd, which has been restated for the move to the QIS 5 approach.
Risk premium used for operating profit, Implied Discount Rates IDR, Internal Rates of Return IRR and payback period For life and pensions operating earnings, Aviva uses normalised investment returns.
The normalised investment returns are expressed as a swap rate based on the typical duration of the assets held plus an asset risk premium.
More detail is given in note E1 Basis of preparation.
The use of asset risk premia only impacts operating earnings as expected returns reflect managements long-term expectations of asset returns in excess of the reference rate from investing in different asset classes.
This assumption does not impact the embedded value or value of new business as asset risk premia are not recognised until earned.
The asset risk premia set out in the table below are added to the ten year swap rate to calculate expected returns.

In addition, the reattribution of the inherited estate has led to additional capital being locked in to support the with-profit business, and this has been included within required capital.
2 Required capital in Ireland under MCEV is 175% for bancassurance and 250% for retail business.
3 Required capital in Italy under MCEV is 165% of the EU minimum for Eurovita and 111% for bancassurance and 130% for retail business.
4 Required capital in Spain is 175% of the EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 130% 134% for bancassurance companies.
5 This capital level is the aggregate capital required for Delta Lloyd.
6 Following a more detailed review of the implied tax position of Aviva US, 2010 results have been calculated including the impact of full corporation tax applying to the cash flows and consequently the 2010 results are grossed up at the corporation tax rate in line with other businesses.
7 Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
A gradual reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 24% over 4 years was announced in the Emergency Budget of 22 June 2010.
2 Act 2010 enacted the first of the 1% rate reductions with effect from April 2011, with subsequent reductions to be dealt with by future legislation.
The benefit to the Groups MCEV net assets arising from the 3% reduction of the rate from 27% to 24% is estimated as 160 million in total.
Other economic assumptions Required capital relating to with-profit business is generally assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Where the fund is insufficient, and additional shareholder support is required, this is included within required capital, including the RIEESA in the UK.
Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the United Kingdom and Ireland continues at the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus.
b Economic assumptions Stochastic calculations The calculation of time value of options and guarantees allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to varying future investment conditions.
The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix, bonus rates and rates of interest and other guarantees granted to policyholders.
Modelled policyholder actions are described under Other assumptions.
Financial statements MCEV 345 Performance review Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information E18 Principal assumptions continued Model United Kingdom, Europe excluding Delta Lloyd and Asia Pacific Swap rates are generated by a model, the LIBOR Market Model LMM, that projects a full swap curve at monthly intervals.
Forward rates are assumed to have a log-normal distribution which guarantees non-negative interest rates.
The model is calibrated to at-themoney swaptions of a variety of terms and tenors.
Swaption volatilities are taken from SuperDerivatives.
Tests have been performed to ensure that sufficient scenarios have been used that the result converges to the stochastic value of the business being valued.
The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on one-year swaps plus an excess return.
This excess return is generally modelled using a log-normal model where volatility varies by time horizon.
This allows the model to capture the term structure of implied volatilities.
The model is calibrated to at-the-money options of a variety of terms.
For the UK, a two-dimensional model is used to capture the term structure of implied volatilities and the projected in the money position.
Option volatilities are taken from Markit.
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although these are not significant asset classes for Aviva outside the UK.
In the absence of liquid market data, the volatilities of these asset classes are based on historic data.
Assumptions for correlations between asset classes have been set based on historic data.
Model North America Swap rates are generated by a model, the LIBOR Market Model Plus LMM, which projects a full swap curve at monthly intervals.
Previously the LMM model was used to generate scenarios.
Forward rates are assumed to have a distribution that lies between the lognormal and normal distributions.
Although this no longer guarantees non-negative interest rates, it maintains interest rates within a more plausible range than the standard Libor Market Model, and gives a better fit to certain swaption volatility surfaces.
The model is calibrated to volatilities for swaptions for ten year swaps for a range of option terms and strike rates.
This excess return is modelled using a log-normal model where volatility varies by time horizon.
Model Delta Lloyd The interest rate model used is a short rate G2 model.
The model is calibrated to the QIS5 yield curve and the swaption implied volatilities.
Swaption implied volatilities are taken from Bloomberg.
The equity model is a Heston model.
Asset classes The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term fixed rate bonds.
The most significant assumptions are the distribution of future long-term interest rates nominal and real and swaption implied volatilities For many businesses, including US, France and Delta Lloyd, the most important assets are fixed rate bonds of various durations.
Summary statistics Swaption implied volatilities The implied volatility is that determined by Black-Scholes formula to reproduce the market price of the option.

For the UK and Delta Lloyd, model property implied volatility is 15% for 31 December 2010 31 December 2009: 15%.
Demographic assumptions Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience with a view to giving a best estimate of future experience.
We have anticipated future changes in experience where that is appropriate, e. g. we have allowed for improvements in future policyholder longevity.
We have set the assumptions based on a best estimate of shareholder outcomes.
In particular, where the policyholder behaviour varies with economic experience, we have set assumptions which are dynamic, i. e. vary depending on the economic assumptions.
For example, surrender and option take up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios.
Additionally, where demographic experience is not driven by economic scenarios but is asymmetric on a stand-alone basis, the best estimate assumption considers the weighted-average expected experience, not simply the median or most likely outcome.
Expense assumptions Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included in the MCEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business in-force and project expenses.
Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of recurring project expenses.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identified separately and are generally charged as incurred.
No future productivity gains have been anticipated.
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to our life businesses, the value of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and value of new business.
Non-hedgeable risk For the opening balance sheet and operating profit, a charge of 2.5% has been applied to the Group-diversified capital required on a 1-in-200 one-year basis over the remaining lifetime of in-force business.
For the closing balance sheet, a charge of 3.3% has been applied.
The charge is set so as to give an aggregate allowance that is in excess of the expected operational risk costs arising from the inforce covered business over its remaining lifetime.
The capital levels used are projected to be sufficient to cover non-hedgeable risks at the 99.5% confidence level one year after the valuation date.
The capital is equal to the capital from the ICA results for those risks considered.
The capital has been projected as running off over the remaining life of the in-force portfolio in line with the drivers of the capital requirement.
In addition to the operational risk allowance, financial non-hedgeable risks and other product level asymmetries have been allowed for.
These allowances are not material as significant financial non-hedgeable risks and product level asymmetries are either modelled explicitly and included in the TVOG or are included in the PVFP through the use of appropriate best estimate assumptions.
