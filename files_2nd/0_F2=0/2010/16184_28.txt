The charge to the income statement is calculated by reference to the number of hours and cycles flown and by reference to the length of the full overhaul cycle.
Costs incurred are charged against the provision.
Neither the timing nor the value of the expenditure can be precisely determined but they can be averaged over time and over a fleet.
The cost of major overhauls of owned airframes and engines is capitalised and depreciated over the period until the next scheduled major overhaul.
Restructuring Restructuring, which includes severance payments, relates to provisions arising as a result of reorganisation and restructuring plans that are irrevocably committed.
Further details of restructuring projects in the current year are set out in Note 3.
The provision is expected to be utilised within 18 months of the balance sheet date.
Other Other provisions relate to litigation including provisions for contingent liabilities recorded on the merger of First Choice, onerous lease contracts that have been entered into in the ordinary course of business and other future obligations, the amount or timing of which is uncertain.
The majority of the provision is anticipated to be utilised within 12 months of the balance sheet date, while the remainder is expected to be utilised within one to four years of the balance sheet date, although the timing and payments related to individual litigation claims is estimated and is inherently uncertain.

Convertible bond reserve The convertible bond reserve comprises the equity element of the convertible bonds and the related portion of the bonds issue costs see Note 19.
The equity element is calculated in accordance with the accounting policy described in Note 1 E ii and is presented net of deferred tax.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose on the business combination of TUI Travel PLC TUI Travel, First Choice Holidays PLC First Choice and the Tourism Division of TUI AG on 3 September 2007.
The merger reserve is non-distributable.
Other reserves The share-based payment credit for the year ended 30 September 2010 of 16m has an associated deferred tax credit of 4m 2009: nil.
During the year ended 30 September 2010 the Groups Employee Benefit Trusts acquired shares at market value for consideration of 7m 2009: nil.
Details of dividends to equity holders of the parent debited to equity in the year are set out in Note 9.
Exchange gains or losses arising on the translation to the Groups reporting currency are recorded in the translation reserve.
Gains or losses arising on cash flow hedges are initially recorded in the hedge reserve and are recycled to the consolidated income statement in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 1 F. The Group also has a capital reserve of 0.1m at 30 September 2010 2009: 0.1m and a revaluation reserve of 0.2m 2009: 0.2m.
The capital reserve is non-distributable.
Non-controlling interest As described in Note 13, the Group purchased a 51% stake in WonderHolding AB during the year.
The non-controlling interest is not considered material.
Financial instruments A Treasury risk overview The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: Market risk in respect of foreign currency rate risk, jet fuel price risk and interest rate risk : Liquidity risk in respect of the Groups ability to meet its liabilities : Credit risk in respect of recovery of amounts owing to the Group : and Capital risk in respect of its capital structure and cost of capital.
com 118 TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The Groups key financial market risks are in relation to foreign currency rates and jet fuel price.
Currency risk results from the substantial cross-border element of the Groups trading and arises on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies of individual Group businesses.
The risk is managed by the use of foreign exchange forward, swap and option contracts.
The Groups exposure to jet fuel prices results from the aircraft fleet operations and is managed using commodity swaps and options.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk that arises principally from the Groups floating rate aircraft leases, and floating rate bank loans and cash balances.
Certain finance leases and loans have fixed interest rates.
Credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk are considered in Notes 25 D, 25 F and 25 K respectively.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework and for ensuring that the Group has adequate policies, procedures and controls to successfully manage the financial risks that it faces.
These form part of the Groups overall Risk Management Framework the framework.
Incorporated within the frameworks terms of reference are the determination of all treasury policies and the monitoring of the effectiveness of those policies.
Group Treasury implements the agreed policies on a day-to-day basis.
The procedures also stipulate the levels of authority applied to approving and to dealing the types of hedging financial instrument used to manage these exposures.
Transactions are only undertaken to hedge underlying exposures.
Financial instruments are not traded, nor are speculative positions taken.
The treasury position of the Group, including liquidity, foreign exchange and fuel hedging exposure, is managed centrally in accordance with policies appropriate to cover specific risks faced by each business unit, and is the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer.
Group Treasury conducts regular reviews of financial risks with business unit management teams and receives regular cash flow and, where relevant, jet fuel usage forecasts from each business unit to ensure hedging instruments match the currency or fuel requirements of each operating business.
Reports and forecasts for the Group, showing hedging instruments and forecast requirements, are submitted monthly to the GMB and to each Board meeting of TUI Travel PLC.
In line with its established policy, the Group has monitored throughout the year its counterparty exposure with individual financial institutions.
Such counterparty risk can arise by way of cash deposited or derivative instruments traded.
B Currency risk management The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies of individual Group businesses which are principally Sterling, US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona.
The Group hedges its foreign currency exposures on a seasonal basis, that is Winter and Summer, with each season comprising a six-month period.
At the start of a season the Group will have hedged substantially all of its foreign currency exposure forecast sales and purchases and related assets and liabilities for that season, using predominantly forward exchange contracts and option-based instruments, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level principally by using forward contracts in respect of non-Sterling denominated airline maintenance provision balances, loan balances and deposits.
The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and, as a result, it is also subject to foreign currency exchange translation risk in respect of the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into Sterling.
The following significant exchange rates to the Groups Sterling presentation currency excluding the impact of hedged transactions are illustrative of the rates applied during the current and prior year: Average rate Mid-spot rate Year ended Year ended 30 September 30 September 30 September 30 September 1 GBP equivalent 2010 2009 2010 2009 US Dollar 1.559 1.560 1.587 1.600 Euro 1.152 1.149 1.163 1.094 Swedish Krona 11.307 12.101 10.631 11.181 As at 30 September 2010, the Group has hedged forecast transactions for $3.4bn 2009: $3.5bn and 1.5bn 2009: 1.2bn for periods up until Winter 2011 principally relating to Winter 2010 and Summer 2011.
C Commodity risk Fuel commodity risk arises from the Groups operation of aircraft.
The Group hedges its fuel commodity exposures on a seasonal basis, being Winter and Summer with each season comprising a six-month period.
At the start of a season the Group will have hedged substantially all of its fuel commodity exposure for that season, using predominantly commodity swaps or options, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
As at 30 September 2010, the Group has hedged transactions for fuel of 1.7m metric tonnes 2009: 1.8m metric tonnes for periods up until Winter 2011.
Details of fuel forward derivative instruments are set out in Note 25 I. www.
com Group at a glance Strategic overview Business performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 119 D Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Credit risk arises from cash balances including bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables, financial guarantees and committed transactions.
Credit risk is managed separately for treasury and operating related credit exposures.
The Group minimises its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored by the Board.
While counterparties are limited to major banks and financial institutions, Group policy ensures that individual counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties where applicable as part of its ongoing assessment of its credit exposure.
Financial instruments are only transacted with major financial institutions with strong credit ratings of A1 P1.
Loans and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
There is no material concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables as the Group has a large number of internationally dispersed customers.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was: Restated Carrying value Carrying value 30 September 30 September 2010 2009 m m Trade and other receivables 814 939 Cash and cash equivalents Note 17 1,304 790 Derivatives contracts used for hedging Note 25 I 165 284 Trade and listed investments Note 12 56 47 Other investments Note 17 36 Total 2,339 2,096 The trade and other receivables balance for 2009 has been restated.
Trade receivables have been reduced by 54m as at 30 September 2009.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for total trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date and by geographic region as well as their ageing is disclosed in Note 16.
Trade and other receivables are shown net of provision for bad and doubtful debts of 55m 2009: 59m.
Cash, cash equivalents and other investments principally comprise money market deposits and other short-term investments.
The investments are with counterparties with a strong credit rating of A1 P1.
At 30 September 2010, approximately 33% 2009: 51% of the Groups unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were invested with counterparties based in the United Kingdom.
A further 33% 2009: 0% was on deposit with TUI AG, the ultimate parent company of the Group.
Trade and other receivables exclude prepaid accommodation and other prepayments which do not meet the definition of a financial instrument.
Prepayments for hotel accommodation, whilst not meeting the definition of a financial asset under IAS 39, give rise to a risk similar to credit risk due to the inherent risk of the Group not recovering the prepayment through full delivery of the related goods and services.
From time to time prepayments can concentrate risk with specific counterparties which are based overseas.
The carrying amount of prepayments which are presented within current and non-current assets forms the maximum credit exposure, before taking into account any security or collateral held by the Group.
Where appropriate, the Group obtains security collateral over the related accommodation property to mitigate credit risk.
At 30 September 2010, prepaid accommodation which is recoverable after more than one year was 115m 2009: 151m.
E Interest rate risk The Group has exposure to interest rate risk arising principally on Sterling, US Dollar and Euro floating interest rates that are attached to the Groups floating rate aircraft leases, and floating rate bank loans and cash balances.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and the Group does not have any interest rate swap derivative instruments.

F Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed circumstances.
The Groups liquidity peaks in July and August, during the European summer holiday season, with the liquidity low point being in December and January.
To manage the liquidity position the Group is able to draw cash advances under its existing bank facilities which principally comprise the following main sources of long-term debt funding: i the external bank revolving syndicated credit facilities totalling 1,060m 2009: 910m plus bonding and letter of credit facilities totalling 90m 2009: 40m which all mature in June 2012 except for a 40m bonding and letter of credit facility in September 2011.
From these facilities, 166m has been utilised for letter of credit purposes at 30 September 2010 2009: 144m : ii a 350m convertible bond due 2014 issued on 1 October 2009 and settled on 5 October 2009: and iii a 400m convertible bond due 2017 issued on 22 April 2010 and settled on 27 April 2010.
The external bank revolving credit facility is used to manage the seasonality of the Groups cash flows and liquidity.
Cash positions, liquidity and available facility headroom are monitored daily by the Group Treasury Department.
In addition to the above facilities a further 30m bonding and letter of credit facility which mature in June 2012 was signed on 15 October 2010.
The Board remains satisfied with the Groups funding and liquidity position.
Fixed charges cover and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, which the Board believes to be the most useful measures of cash generation and gearing, as well as being the main basis for covenants in our external credit facilities, were met at the year end and throughout the year.
Fixed charges cover is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and operating lease rentals charge EBITDAR divided by net interest plus operating lease rentals.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
Both covenants are measured on an underlying basis as defined in Note 1 B iv.
com Group at a glance Strategic overview Business performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 121 In respect of the delivery of new aircraft, the Groups established strategy is to refinance new aircraft in advance of their delivery dates and therefore the Group does not forecast to use internal cash resources for new aircraft purchases.
Details of aircraft purchase commitments at the year end are given in Note 28.
The following are the undiscounted contractual cash flows of financial liabilities, including interest payments calculated using interest rates in force at each balance sheet date: Carrying Contractual Within Between Between More than amount cash flows 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years 30 September 2010 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Convertible bonds 633 982 41 41 461 439 Shareholder loan 575 580 580 Secured bank loans 24 26 10 2 14 Unsecured bank loans 12 13 9 2 2 Finance leases 269 311 154 21 71 65 Loan notes 2 3 2 1 Other financial liabilities 38 38 38 Trade and other payables 2,678 2,678 2,630 48 Derivative financial liabilities Contracts used for hedging 145 146 119 27 Total 4,376 4,777 3,583 142 548 504 Carrying Contractual Within Between Between More than amount cash flows 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years 30 September 2009 restated m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Shareholder loan 840 865 249 616 Secured bank loans 29 31 6 10 15 Unsecured bank loans 22 27 15 3 6 3 Finance leases 192 206 33 147 23 3 Loan notes 6 7 5 1 1 Other financial liabilities 39 39 39 Trade and other payables 2,889 2,889 2,858 31 Derivative financial liabilities Contracts used for hedging 302 348 307 38 3 Total 4,319 4,412 3,512 846 48 6 Trade payables as at 30 September 2009 have been increased by 58m following the restatement disclosed in Note 1 B ii.
The actual repayment of revolving credit facilities will vary.
The timing reflected in the tables is based on the first date that the Group can be required to settle the liability.
Trade and other payables exclude customers monies received in advance, deferred income, contingent consideration and other non-contractual payables.
At 30 September 2010 the Group had available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 984m 2009: 806m, comprising letters of credit, guarantees and revolving, floating rate credit facilities for cash borrowings.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying the Groups financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements.
The Group was in full compliance with its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.

Other financial assets have reduced by 54m see Note 16 and other financial liabilities have increased by 58m see Note 20 at 30 September 2009.
Following the amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 39 the Group has re-presented the 2009 table in Note 25 G. The main changes are to split the assets and liabilities previously classified in the held for trading column into financial assets and liabilities at fair value through income statement and derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting.
The Groups derivative assets 284m and liabilities 302m at 30 September 2009 have been classified as derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting and the LTUR put option of 39m has been classified as a financial liability at fair value through income statement.
In addition the deferred consideration liability of 20m at 30 September 2009 has been reclassified from amortised cost to financial assets and liabilities at fair value through income statement to reflect a more appropriate categorisation under IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
There are no other changes to the table.
The reclassifications between categories of financial instrument have no impact on any of the primary statements in either year.
Other financial assets comprise trade receivables, other receivables which are receivable within and after more than one year as well as other investments due within one year.
Other financial liabilities comprise trade payables, accruals and other financial liabilities which are payable within and after more than one year.

30 September 2009: Trade and other receivables has been reduced by 54m see Note 16 and Trade and other payables have been increased by 58m see Note 20 as a result of the restatement described in Note 1 B ii.
Fair value measurements The adoption of the amendment to IFRS 7 in the year ended 30 September 2010 requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements of financial instruments through the use of a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritises the valuation techniques used in fair value calculations.
The levels can be broadly described as follows: Level 1 use of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 use of observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 3 use of inputs not based on observable market data but reflecting managements own assumptions about pricing the asset or liability.
The Group maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the most relevant data available.
If there are multiple inputs available that fall into different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument is categorised on the basis of the lowest level input.

These consist of the Groups investment in The Airline Group 29m and other trade investments in the equity of unlisted companies 8m.
Both are valued using assumptions not observable in the market and so have been categorised as level 3 instruments in the fair value hierarchy see Note 12.
The level 1 trade investment is the Groups holding in Air Berlin PLC see Note 12.
Derivative assets and liabilities Derivatives are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques.
These techniques incorporate inputs at levels 1 and 2, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
These market inputs are used in the discounted cash flow calculation incorporating the instruments term, notional amount and discount rate, and taking credit risk into account.
As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in the markets, these instruments are categorised as level 2 in the hierarchy.
Other financial liabilities The put option to acquire the remaining equity stake in LTUR Tourismus AG 38m is classified as an other financial liability with changes in fair value included in operating profit.
The deferred consideration balance 21m is also measured at fair value based on the relevant contracts.
As all of these financial liabilities are valued using assumptions not observable in the market, they are categorised as level 3 instruments in the fair value hierarchy.
Reclassification to non-current interest bearing receivables 7m of loan notes owed to the Group by The Airline Group Limited have been reclassified from trade and other investments to non-current interest bearing receivables during 2010. www.

Ineffectiveness for the year ended 30 September 2010 comprised a credit of 2m 2009: credit 5m relating to fuel hedging and this is included within underlying operating profit.
Aircraft order book derivatives Last year US dollar cash flow hedges in connection with the Groups aircraft order books were fully unwound and settled early in a planned process.
Payments for new aircraft in US dollars are now planned to be funded by way of proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions and future US dollar currency requirements are not required to be forward hedged.
The cumulative gain on aircraft order book derivatives from the period when these hedges were effective up until the termination of these hedges was recognised in the hedging reserve.
Net gains relating to aircraft orders delivered or cancelled in the prior year comprising 10 Boeing 787s were recycled to the consolidated income statement immediately and were recorded in separately disclosed items Note 3.
There were no deliveries in 2010 and the remaining amount of 11m net of deferred taxation remains in reserves available to be recycled to match the delivery of the related aircraft.
J Amounts recognised directly in equity The following amounts have been recognised directly in equity during the year: Year ended Year ended 30 September 30 September 2010 2009 m m Hedging reserve Effective portion of changes in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments 33 60 Fair value of cash flow hedges transferred to the consolidated income statement 41 81 74 141 Deferred tax on the above items recognised directly in equity is shown in Note 7 iii.
K Capital management The Boards policy has been to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group has a roadmap to deliver sustainable long-term value to shareholders with a return on invested capital greater than the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Progress in achieving this objective has been made during this year, by improving underlying operating margins to 14.3% which increases return on invested capital ROIC to 9.9% 2009: restated 8.6%.
ROIC is defined as Underlying NOPAT Average Invested Capital.
Underlying NOPAT is underlying Net Operating Profit After a Tax charge at the effective annual rate.
Underlying as a measure of operating profit is defined in Note 1 B iv.
Average Invested Capital comprises an average of the net assets at the start and end of the year of the Group adjusted to add back net debt, cumulative goodwill impairment charges and defined benefit pension scheme net deficits.
There is also an adjustment to adjust net debt to reflect a seasonal average cash balance.
Calculations for the current and prior years are: Restated Year ended Year ended 30 September 30 September 2010 2009 Note m m Underlying operating profit excluding impact of volcanic disruption Consolidated income statement 447 401 Taxation at the underlying effective rate of 27% 2009: 28% 121 112 Underlying NOPAT 326 289 Net assets Consolidated balance sheet 1,973 2,174 Net debt 26 249 338 Seasonal net debt adjustment 300 300 Cumulative goodwill impairment charge 2010: Spain, 5m and Italy, 7m: 2009: Sunsail Clubs, 7m: 2008: TUIFly, 112m 10 131 119 Defined benefit pension net deficit 5 C 493 500 Invested Capital 3,146 3,431 Average Invested Capital 3,289 3,379 ROIC 9.9% 8.6% Pro forma unaudited underlying operating profit Note 1 B iii.
Net assets includes the liability element 633m of the convertible bond.
ROIC in 2009 prior to the restatement described in Note 1 B ii was 9.2%.
com Group at a glance Strategic overview Business performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 127 The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the levels of debt borrowings undertaken and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
An analysis of net debt at the year end is in Note 26.
Certain subsidiaries have external capital requirements as a result of applicable travel industry regulations in their jurisdictions.
Compliance with these regulations is mandatory for the relevant operating businesses in those countries in order that they are able to continue trading.
Key countries with such mandatory capital requirements are France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
The capital requirements in these countries stipulate maintaining minimum equity net asset levels in operating subsidiaries.
All such capital requirements were complied with as at 30 September 2010.
None of these requirements are individually or collectively significant to the overall Group and do not place any significant restriction on the Groups funding or operations.
Underlying operating profit, underlying NOPAT, net assets, invested capital, average invested capital and ROIC have been restated.
L Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a projection of likely future events and gains or losses.
The sensitivity analysis includes the following assumptions: Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense of variable financial instruments: Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at fair value: Changes in market interest, currency and fuel rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and the majority of hedges are expected to be highly effective with the main exception being collecting FX forward contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting: and Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets or liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the consolidated income statement and equity of a 1% 100 basis points difference in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in Sterling against all other currencies and in fuel prices, from the rates applicable at the balance sheet date, with all other variables remaining constant.
Interest rate risk Under the above assumptions, a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would result in a 5m increase in interest expense in the consolidated income statement or equity 2009: no material impact.
A 100 basis points reduction in interest rates is not considered reasonably possible.
Currency risk Similarly, under the above assumptions, a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all principal exchange rates would not have altered the reported loss before tax September 2009: loss reduced by 4m, profit increased by 5m, respectively principally relating to the translation of the income statements of overseas subsidiaries.
Equity before tax would have decreased by 210m 2009: 376m or increased by 215m 2009: 376m, respectively.
Fuel price risk The sensitivity analysis is based on a 10% increase or decrease in fuel prices and the sensitivity will differ correspondingly if the fuel markets are more or less volatile.
Under these assumptions, with a 10% increase or decrease in the unit price of fuel, profit before tax would neither increase nor decrease materially, because of the fuel price hedging policy and appropriate pricing adjustments.
Equity before tax would increase by 79m 2009: 70m, or decrease by 78m 2009: 70m, respectively.
M Litigation risk The Group has a policy to mitigate the financial risk of litigation and disaster through insurance with third party providers and the use of captive insurance companies.
The Groups exposure to risk is capped by single event and aggregate limits, with insurance in place for exposures above these limits.
The Group provides for outstanding claims, including settlement expenses, using a consistent methodology based upon historical claims patterns, average claims amounts, external legal advice and future expectations.

Key accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under adopted IFRSs requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the year.
The Directors evaluate the estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis.
Such estimates and judgements are based upon historical experience and other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from estimates.
Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the applications of these policies and estimates.
Key estimates and judgements have been made in respect of the following areas: A Estimates Intangible assets Goodwill carrying value A full impairment review has been performed of all goodwill and intangibles balances held across the Group on a cash generating unit basis.
The impairment review is performed on a value in use basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth rate.
Further details, including sensitivity analysis, are given in Note 10 and the accounting policy is set out in Note 1 P. Defined benefit pension plans A qualified independent actuary undertakes the estimation of the present value of the Groups obligations under defined benefit pension schemes using assumptions taken from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
These assumptions may not be borne out in practice, especially due to the long timescales involved.
In particular, the valuation of scheme assets is based on the fair value at the balance sheet date.
As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short-term, their value may change significantly prior to realisation.
In reviewing the work of the qualified independent actuary, management was required to exercise judgement to satisfy itself that appropriate weight had been afforded to macroeconomic factors.
Details of the actual assumptions used, including sensitivity analysis, are set out in Note 5 C. Derivative financial instruments Judgement is required in the assessment of prospective effectiveness and specifically in the assessment of the probability of forecast transactions, both at hedge inception and during the period over which hedge accounting is adopted.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments can also involve judgement.
Where appropriate, external valuations from financial institutions are undertaken to support the carrying value of such items.
Details of sensitivity analysis are set out in Note 25 L. www.
com Group at a glance Strategic overview Business performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 131 B Judgements Separately disclosed items Separately disclosed items are those significant items which in managements judgement are highlighted by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate Notes 3 and 4.
Other asset carrying values Management performs an assessment at each balance sheet date of all material assets across the Group for signs of impairment.
Key judgement areas include the carrying values of land and buildings, aircraft, ships, yachts and motorboats, trade receivables and prepaid accommodation.
The recovery of these assets is dependent on estimated future cash flows receivable and the provision of future services or goods by third parties.
Useful economic lives and residual values are subject to regular management review.
Business combinations Judgement and estimation is required in the identification and valuation of separable assets and liabilities on acquisitions.
In particular, judgement and estimation is required in the identification and valuation of separable intangible assets, being brands, orders books and customer databases, and determining appropriate useful economic lives for these assets.
Judgement and estimation is also required in determining contingent consideration payable in respect of acquisitions.
Details of acquisitions are set out in Note 13.
Liabilities In accounting for provisions, judgement is required in determining occurrence probability, maturity and level of risk.
Judgement and estimation is required in determining aircraft maintenance, restructuring and onerous lease provisions.
Due to the volume of transactions and the materiality of period end accruals, judgement is also required in respect of the recognition and derecognition of airline and accommodation operating accruals.
Details of provisions made and the basis on which the provision has been calculated is disclosed in Note 21 and the accounting policy is set out in Note 1 T. Share-based payments Judgement and estimation is required in determining the fair value of shares at the date of award.
The fair value is estimated using valuation techniques which take into account the awards term, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility of the market price of the Companys shares.
Details of share-based payments and the assumptions applied are disclosed in Note 5 D and the accounting policy is set out in Note 1 Y ix.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale The classification of non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale requires judgement in determining whether the planned disposal is highly probable and able to be realised within 12 months.
The measurement of held for sale assets at their fair value less costs to sell can also require significant judgement if there is no active market.
Lease accounting Judgement is required in the initial classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and, in respect of finance leases, determining the appropriate discount rate implicit in the lease to discount minimum lease payments.
In respect of certain leases classified as finance leases, it has not been possible to reliably estimate lessors residual values and management has been required to independently estimate an appropriate discount rate.
Judgement is also required in respect of the treatment of gains and losses arising on the sale and leaseback of assets.
The accounting policy for leases is set out in Notes 1 G, 1 H and 1 Q.
Taxation The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate transactions in the UK and overseas jurisdictions.
After taking appropriate external advice, the Group makes provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which is reliably measurable.
Judgement is also required in the assessment of the future recoverability of tax losses and recognition of deferred tax assets.
Details of unrecognised tax losses are given in Note 14.
Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments Judgements have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order to assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to those hoteliers.
Fair value measurements Management has to make judgements regarding the valuation of some financial instruments that use inputs that are not observable in active markets.
These are disclosed in Note 25 G. www.
