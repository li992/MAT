2 Operating profits are determined on the basis of including longer-term investment returns.
EEV and IFRS operating profits are stated after excluding the effect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns against long-term assumptions, the shareholders share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes, transaction costs arising from business combinations in the period, costs associated with the terminated AIA transaction, and the effect of disposal and results of the Taiwan agency business, for which the sale process was completed in June 2009.
In 2010, the Group amended the presentation of IFRS operating profit for its US insurance operations to remove the net equity hedge accounting effect incorporating related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs and include it in short-term fluctuations.
The prior period comparatives for 2009 and 2008 have been amended accordingly.
In addition, for EEV basis results, operating profit excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the market value movement on core borrowings.
3 New business sales exclude the results of the Japanese life operation which ceased writing new business in February 2010, and the results of the Taiwan agency business for which the sale process was completed in June 2009.
4 Funds under management comprise funds of the Group held in the statement of financial position and external funds that are managed by Prudential asset management operations.
5 The surpluses shown are before allowing for the final dividends for each year, which are paid in the following year.
Since 2007, following the sale of Egg Banking, Prudential has been subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Insurance Groups Directive IGD which applies to groups whose activities are mainly in the insurance sector.
Prior to the sale of Egg Banking, Prudential was subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Financial Conglomerates Directive FCD which applies to groups with significant crosssector activities in insurance and banking investment services.
Prudential was classified as an insurance conglomerate under the FCD.
As the requirements for insurance conglomerates under the FCD are closely aligned to the requirements for insurance groups under the IGD, the move for Prudential from FCD to IGD did not result in a significant impact.

It excludes the longer-term investment return on assets in excess of those covering shareholder-backed policyholder liabilities, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets.
ii Fee income represents profits driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses.
iii With-profits business represents the shareholders transfer from the with-profits fund in the period.
iv Insurance margin primarily represents profits derived from the insurance risks of mortality, morbidity and persistency.
v Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses.
vi Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the period attributable to shareholders.
It excludes items such as restructuring costs and Solvency II costs which are not included in the segment profit for insurance as well as items that are more appropriately included in other source of earnings lines e. g. investment expenses are netted off investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate.
vii DAC adjustments comprises DAC amortisation for the period, excluding amounts related to short-term uctuations, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.

Note i During 2010 the Group amended its presentation of operating profit for its US insurance operations to remove the net equity hedge accounting effect associated with Jacksons variable annuity and fixed index annuity products, which are now classified in the Groups supplementary analysis of profit before tax attributable to shareholders as part of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
2009 and 2008 operating profit have been amended accordingly and so net equity hedge effects of 159 million negative and 71 million positive have been removed from the previously stated operating profits of 1,405 million and 1,283 million to give restated values of 1,564 million and 1,212 million, respectively.

360 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ADDITIONAL UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED II a : ANALYSIS OF LONG-TERM INSURANCE BUSINESS PRE-TAX IFRS OPERATING PROFIT BASED ON LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS BY DRIVER CONTINUED Analysis of Asian operating profit drivers: Spread income has increased from 31 million in 2009 to 70 million in 2010.
This increase arises primarily as a result of improved investment return in Vietnam where the return in 2009 was particularly low compared to both 2008 and 2010 and additional dividend income received in Japan.
Fee income has increased both in absolute terms by 42 million and as an improvement in margin, which has increased 10 bps to 109 bps.
This primarily relates in a change in mix towards those countries with a higher asset management fee margin e. g. Indonesia from countries where fees charged are lower.
Insurance margin has increased by 139 million from 253 million in 2009 to 392 million in 2010.
This reects the continued growth in the in-force book, which has a relatively high proportion of risk-based products.
2010 includes 19 million relating to reserving changes in India and China.
Margin on revenues has increased by 252 million, reecting the growth in the size of the portfolio and changes in country mix.
Acquisition costs the costs as a percentage of APE new business sales has fallen over the period 2008-2010, reecting managements continued focus on capital management activities, such as the closure of Japan to new business in the first quarter of 2010 and changes to business and country mix.
The analysis above uses shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE, excluding with-profits sales from the denominator the margin would become 2010: 53 per cent, 2009: 56 per cent and 2008: 58 per cent.
Administration expenses margin has reduced from 339 bps in 2009 in part reecting operational leverage benefit and a shift in mix towards countries with highly efficient business models e. g. Indonesia.

Excluding this effect 108 million, spread margin in 2010 would have been 205 bps.
The increase over the 2009 margin of 179 bps is due in part to decreased crediting rates on xed annuities.
Fee income margins are based on the average of the opening and closing separate account balances.
In normal years this is expected to be a reasonable proxy for the average balances throughout the year.
In 2009 separate account ows were weighted towards the end of the year artificially lowering the 2009 margin.
Using an average based on end of month balances, margins show little movement between years, 2010: 200 bps: 2009: 203 bps: 2008: 200 bps indicating that absolute revenue amounts are growing in line with separate accounts values.
Separate account values increased between 2008 and 2010 both as a result of strong sales and improving equity markets.
Insurance margin represents operating profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry net income.
Positive net ows into variable annuity business with life contingent and other guarantees have helped to improve the margin from 154 million in 2009 to 188 million in 2010.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL UNAUDITED STATEMENTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION 361 Acquisition costs have increased in 2010 in absolute terms compared to 2009 following an increase in sales volumes.
However, acquisition costs as a percentage of APE has fallen from 76 per cent in 2009 to 73 per cent in 2010 as more advisers are electing to take asset-based commission, which is paid over the life of the policy based on fund value.
This asset-based commission is treated as an administration expense in this analysis as opposed to a cost of acquisition, resulting in a lower acquisition cost ratio but a higher administration expenses margin.
2008 acquisition costs as a percentage of APE sales were 63 per cent, lower than 2009 and 2010.
This is primarily because sales of GICs in 2008 APE 120 million, on which no acquisition costs are incurred, reduces the margin for that year.
Excluding GIC APE sales the acquisition cost ratio for 2008 becomes 76 per cent, in line with 2009.
Administration expenses margin has increased to 63 bps in 2010, partly as a result of higher asset based commission, which lowers acquisition costs but increases the expenses classied as administration expenses in the table above.

Analysis of UK operating profit drivers: Spread income has increased by 53 million to 251 million in 2010, reecting in a higher margin of 120 bps, up from 106 bps in 2009.
The improved margin primarily reects the beneficial impacts of the bulk annuity deal written in 2010, improved margins on retail annuity new business and improved spread on equity release business following its closure to new business.
Spread income was lower in 2008 due to lower margins on new business and the establishment of credit default and deation reserves in that year in light of the credit crisis offset by the impact of actions to rebalance the credit portfolio.
Fee income has increased by 11 per cent to 60 million broadly in line with the value of unit-linked liabilities following the improvement in equity markets.
Margin on revenues represents premiums charges for expenses and other sundry net income received by the UK.
Lower amounts were recorded in 2010 223 million compared to 2009 275 million reecting, in part, lower premiums from shareholder-backed retail business in 2010 as compared to 2009.
Insurance margin has fallen by 29 million to 12 million in 2010, reecting that 2009 included a one-off benefit of 34 million in respect of a longevity swap on certain aspects of the UKs annuity back-book liabilities, which was not repeated in 2010.
Acquisition costs as a percentage of new business sales has fallen from 27 per cent in 2009 to 20 per cent in 2010.
This reects in part the impact of the bulk annuity deal which contributed 88 million APE in the period with a relatively low level of acquisition costs, together with the closure of equity release to new business as well as on-going cost saving initiatives.
The ratio above expresses the percentage of shareholder acquisition costs as a percentage of total APE sales.
It is therefore impacted by the level of with-profits sales in the year.
Acquisition costs as a percentage of shareholder-backed new business sales were 36 per cent in 2010 49 per cent in 2009, with the most significant impact being the effect of the bulk annuity deal.
Administration expenses have fallen by 60 million to 113 million and the ratio from 48 bps in 2009 to 27 bps in 2010.
This is primarily the result of cost savings initiatives initiated by the UKIO in line with the business stated objectives.
362 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ADDITIONAL UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED II b : ASIAN OPERATIONS ANALYSIS OF IFRS OPERATING PROFIT BY TERRITORY Operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for Asian operations is analysed as follows: 2010 m 2009 m note ii China 12 4 Hong Kong 51 48 note iii India 60 12 Indonesia 157 102 Japan 6 18 Korea 12 6 Malaysia Underlying results 97 65 note i Exceptional credit 63 Philippines 2 2 Singapore 129 112 note iv Taiwan bancassurance business 4 7 Thailand 2 1 Vietnam 43 30 Other 5 2 note v TOTAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS 536 416 Development expenses 4 6 TOTAL LONG-TERM BUSINESS OPERATING PROFIT 532 410 Asset management 72 55 TOTAL ASIAN OPERATIONS 604 465 Notes i For the Malaysia life business, under the basis applied previously, 2008 IFRS basis liabilities were determined on the local regulatory basis using prescribed interest rates such that a high degree of prudence resulted.
As of 1 January 2009, the local regulatory basis has been replaced by the Malaysian authoritys risk-based capital RBC framework.
In the light of this development, the Company has re-measured the liabilities by reference to the method applied under the new RBC framework, which is more realistic than the previous approach, but with an overlay constraint to the method such that negative reserves derived at an individual policyholder level are not included.
This change has resulted in a one-off release from liabilities at 1 January 2009 of 63 million.
ii Chinas operating loss of 12 million is after a net charge of 17 million for local reserving changes and associated impacts that have been reflected in the Groups IFRS accounts.
Excluding this effect, Chinas underlying result is a 5 million profit.
iii The operating profit of 60 million from India, a joint venture, includes 36 million arising from changes that improve the reserving estimation technique.
iv Sale of Taiwan agency business In order to facilitate comparisons of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns that reflect the Groups retained operations, the results attributable to the Taiwan agency business for which the sale process was completed in June 2009 are excluded from analysis of operating profit.
v Analysis of operating profit between new and in-force business The result for insurance operations comprises amounts in respect of new business and business in-force as follows: 2010 m 2009 m New business strain excluding Japan 56 72 Japan 1 6 New business strain including Japan 57 78 Business in force 593 494 Total 536 416 The IFRS new business strain corresponds to approximately four per cent of new business APE premiums for 2010 2009: approximately six per cent of new business APE.
The strain reflects the aggregate of the pre-tax regulatory basis strain to net worth after IFRS adjustments for deferral of acquisition costs and deferred income where appropriate.

Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL UNAUDITED STATEMENTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION 365 III a : MEMORANDUM FAIR VALUE OF JACKSONS GMDB AND GMWB LIABILITIES The IFRS accounting for minimum death and withdrawal benets guarantees of the Groups US insurance operations has a mixed measurement approach.
Not for life Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benets GMWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives.
Where the economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host insurance contract, and where the contract is not measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and carried at fair value as a derivative in accordance with IAS 39.
In Jackson, the embedded derivative liabilities for GMWB liabilities are fair valued using the economic assumptions shown below, in line with IAS 39 FAS 157 Fair Value Measurements.
Where a significant insurance element is present, such as for Guaranteed Minimum Death benefit GMDB and for life GMWB, the guarantees are accounted for as part of the accounting applied to the host insurance contracts.
Under IFRS 4, the insurance contract accounting applied prior to IFRS adoption has continued to be applied.
Accordingly for US variable annuity business the US GAAP standards applicable to insurance contract accounting are applied.
Consistent with that approach, the GMDB and for life GMWB guarantees are valued under FASB Accounting Standards codification Topic 944 sub-topics 944-20, 944-40 and 944-80, formerly known as SOP 03-1 Statement of Position 03-1: Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises Contracts and for Separate Accounts.
The two reserving methodologies typically produce quite different patterns of results.
It is the variation in assumptions, and the way the two reserving methods react to emerging experience, that produces potentially significant differences in reserve patterns through time.
Both methods determine a hypothetical fee or charge referred to in the rest of this note as fee assessment that is anticipated to fund future projected benefit payments arising using the assumptions applicable for that method.
After determination at issue, the FAS 157 fee assessment is xed for the life of the policy, so that variations in experience from that assumed at issue, as well as cash ow timing issues, will create a liability or asset as the value of future benets becomes more or less, respectively, than the value of the fee assessments.
The SOP 03-1 fee assessment, on the other hand, is recomputed at each valuation date to take into account emerging experience and cash ow timing differences.
After redetermination based on valuation date parameters, the new fee assessment is applied retrospectively from issue date to recompute the current reserve provision.
This retrospective aspect of the calculation is not present in the FAS 157 methodology.
The chart below compares the assumption bases for the two methods in general terms as well as showing representative comparative values as of 31 December 2010.
The comparative values for the projected earned rate and AA corporate bond rate are the 10-year rate in both cases, and the comparative value for volatility is the 5-year rate.
Assumption SOP 03-1 IAS 39 FAS 157 Fund earned rate 8.4% before fees Quoted rate swap curve 10-year rate: 3.4% before fees Discount rate 8.4% AA corporate rate curve 10-year rate: 4.8% Equity volatility 15% Implied curve 5-year volatility: 24% To provide an approximate translation of values from the SOP 03-1 basis to the IAS 39 basis, the table below shows estimates of the impact of changing each primary economic assumption from the SOP 03-1 values to the IAS 39 values.
Two other items are shown in addition: a reconciling item to account for the difference in how each method adjusts for emerging economic experience labelled as the method component below, and a further adjustment to recognise the impact of additional fees collected over and above those considered for reserving purposes i. e. the difference between fees actually collected and the hypothetical fee assessment referenced earlier.
366 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ADDITIONAL UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED III a : MEMORANDUM FAIR VALUE OF JACKSONS GMDB AND GMWB LIABILITIES CONTINUED Guaranteed benefit liability supplemental disclosure as of 31 December 2010 GMWB GMWB GMDB for life not for life Total As recorded in the 31 December 2010 financial statements: Note m m m m SOP 03-1 1 220 29 249 IAS 39 fair value 1 201 201 Total per 31 December 2010 financial statements 450 Change in assumed fund earned rate 2 375 25 n a 400 Change in discount rate 3 200 50 n a 250 Change in equity volatility assumption 4 225 0 n a 225 Change in method 5 150 25 n a 175 700 Hypothetical IAS 39 basis fair value 6 870 280 1,150 Adjustment to full fees 7 200 600 800 Hypothetical fair value with full fee recognition 8 670 320 350 Notes 1 Note GMWB benefits have reported components on both an SOP 03-1 and IAS 39 basis.
2 Change in fund earned rate: 8.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent, producing significantly higher values of future benefit payments due to lower future assumed fund growth and therefore greater potential for future guaranteed benefit payouts.
For GMWBs, future fee income is less dramatically affected, given that for most benefit forms fee income is based on a more stable benefit base rather than a current account value.
3 Change in discount rate: 8.4 per cent to 4.8 per cent, producing significantly higher values, both for future benefit payments and future fees, with a net increase in liability.
The absolute impact of this item will be influenced not only by the rate difference, but also by current market conditions, as the proportional impact of a particular rate change will be diluted if applied to a lower absolute value of future cash flows.
4 Change in equity volatility assumption: 15 per cent to 24 per cent, producing higher values, primarily for future benefit payments.
The impact is muted for GMWBs due primarily to the length of time until benefit payments occur, and also by the SOP 03-1 methodology itself.
5 Generally, it is expected that the SOP 03-1 methodology will lag market events in terms of reflecting their impact in the reserve calculation.
This is because of the retrospective aspect of the calculation described above.
This line item is also the balancing item in the reconciliation so contains any cross-effects from other variables.
6 Representation of an approximate hypothetical IAS 39 FAS 157 value were all guaranteed benefits to be reported on this basis.
7 Value of actual fees collected, on an IAS 39 assumption basis, over and above those already considered in the reserve calculation.
The reserve calculation restricts the level of future guarantee fees to a level that is sufficient to meet the expected benefit payments at issue using at issue assumptions to avoid profit recognition at inception.
8 Resulting modified hypothetical IAS 39 value including adjustment for the value of fees in excess of those considered in the reserve calculation.
In all cases, values shown above, were they to be reected in actual financial statements, would be signicantly offset by an adjustment to deferred acquisition costs, which is impacted by changes in gross profit elements of the variable annuity product.
Thus, for example, it might be expected that the GMDB impacts shown would be offset by some 70 to 75 per cent of the change illustrated, and the GMWB impacts shown would be offset by some 50 to 55 per cent of the change illustrated.
