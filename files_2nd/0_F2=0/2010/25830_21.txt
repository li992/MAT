Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2010 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
There has been an amendment to FRS 29 in respect of fair value disclosures and details of this are given in note 19 on page 46. b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which are quoted bid market prices for investments traded in active markets.
Changes in the value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on sales are included in the capital column of the Income Statement within Gains losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Gains and losses on sales of investments, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and other capital receipts and payments, are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end and unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are dealt with in capital reserves within Investment holding gains and losses.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Stocklending income is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue except for expenses incidental to purchases and sales of investments which are written off to capital.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
Details of transaction costs can be found in note 10 on page 42. e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to revenue.

Annual Report & Accounts 2010 37 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Derivative financial instruments, including short term forward currency contracts, are valued at fair value, which is the net unrealised gain or loss, and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Bank loans are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss on monetary assets arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
h Taxation Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
i VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
VAT recoverable is calculated using the partial exemption method based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.

Annual Report & Accounts 2010 b Factors affecting current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2009: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2010 2009 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation 2,942 152,217 155,159 8,468 121,708 113,240 Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax of 28% 2009: 28% 824 42,621 43,445 2,371 34,078 31,707 Effects of: Non taxable capital gains losses 42,621 42,621 34,07834,078 Non taxable overseas dividends 771 771 Income taxed in different periods 240 240 101 101 Overseas taxation 775 775 1,105 1,105 Unrelieved expenses and charges 333 333 Brought forward expenses and charges utilised 626 626 2,270 2,270 775 775 1,105 1,105 The Company has an unrecognised deferred taxation asset of 5,182,000 2009: 8,514,000.
This asset has accumulated because deductible expenses have exceeded taxable income in past years.
No asset has been recognised in the accounts because, given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred taxation on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

In accordance with the accounting policy of the Company, this dividend will be reflected in the accounts for the year ending 31st March 2011.
The requirements of section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are considered on the basis of dividends declared in respect of the financial year, as above.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The disclosures required by the amendment to FRS 29: Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments are given below.
The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 29 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio and derivative financial instruments.
The Companys liabilities are not held at fair value.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 37.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 29 hierarchy: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total '000 '000 '000 '000 Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss at 31st March 2010 Equity investments 416,678 416,678 Liquidity funds 12,934 12,934 Total 429,612429,612 There have been no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the year.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term in order to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close co-operation with the Board and the Manager, co-ordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in equity shares of European companies and a Euro liquidity fund which are both held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and short term forward currency contracts for the purpose of settling short term liabilities.
46 JPMorgan European Fledgeling Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing may be used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the sterling value of the portfolio of investments.
This borrowing is limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income received in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2009: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the Euro, Danish krone, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Swiss francs and the other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had strengthened this would have had the following effect: 2010 2009 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 812 911 Capital return 30 551 Total return after taxation for the year 842 1,462 Net assets 842 1,462 48 JPMorgan European Fledgeling Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Conversely, if sterling had weakened this would have had the following effect: 2010 2009 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 812 911 Capital return 30 551 Total return after taxation for the year 842 1,462 Net assets 842 1,462 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is broadly representative of the whole year.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate cash borrowings.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
The Company may finance part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on the multi currency loan facility.
However, amounts drawn down on this facility are for short term one month periods and therefore there is limited exposure to interest rate risk.
Derivatives are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The Company has no financial assets or liabilities carrying fixed rates of interest.
The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates using the year end figures, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
2010 2009 000 000 Amounts exposed to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 236 3,649 JPM Euro Liquidity Fund 12,934 6,206 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year bank loan 13,380 Total exposure 210 9,855 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR.
The target interest earned on the JPM Euro Liquidity Fund is the 7 day Euro London Interbank Bid Rate.
In July 2009, the Company arranged a Euro 15 million 1 year Floating Rate Loan Facility with ING Bank NV.
Under the terms of this agreement, the Company may draw down up to Euro 15 million, or sterling equivalent, at an interest rate of EURIBOR as offered in the market for the relevant period, plus a margin of 1.6% per annum plus the mandatory cost rate, which is the lenders cost of complying with the regulatory requirements of the European Central Bank during the term of the advance.
This facility has been utilised during the year but was undrawn at the year end.
Annual Report & Accounts 2010 49 Notes to the Accounts continued 20.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued ii Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure continued In addition to the above, in December 2009 the Company arranged a Euro 65 million 1 year Floating Rate Loan Facility with ING Bank NV.
Under the terms of this agreement, the Company may draw down up to Euro 65 million, or sterling equivalent, at an interest rate of EURIBOR as offered in the market for the relevant period, plus a margin of 1.6% per annum plus the mandatory cost rate.
At the year end, the Company had drawn down Euro 15 million on this facility at an interest rate of 2.44% per annum, repayable on 8th April 2010.
A similar facility with ING Bank was in place during the preceding year which was not drawn on.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2009: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, the liquidity of which in normal markets is frequently tested by the Investment Managers and which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
All of the Companys assets are considered as being realisable within one month.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements.
Details of the current loan facilities are given in part a ii to this note on pages 49 to 50.
Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2010 2009 Three Not more Three months than one months or less year Total or less Total 000 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Securities purchased awaiting settlement 13,549 13,549 7,291 7,291 Short term loan 13,380 13,380 Purchase of shares into Treasury awaiting settlement 1,040 1,040 436 436 Other creditors and accruals 168 168 121 121 Derivative financial instrument: forward foreign currency contract held at fair value through profit or loss 11 14,757 13,380 28,137 7,849 7,849 JPMorgan European Fledgeling Investment Trust plc.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 80% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments, excluding holdings in liquidity funds, expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
At 31st March 2010, gearing calculated on this basis was 100.2% 2009: 98.1%.
Companys capital comprises the following: 2010 2009 000 000 Debt Bank loan falling due within one year 13,380 Equity Equity share capital 11,771 12,178 Reserves 404,111 257,900 415,882 270,078 Total capital 429,262 270,078 The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: and the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury.
