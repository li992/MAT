Financial risk management Financial risk management Financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the Group and the financing of those activities.
Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, each being reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the appropriate mix is maintained.
The Groups main exposure to foreign currency fluctuations arises through its activities in South Africa where both translational and transactional exposure exist.
It is Group policy not to cover the effects of exchange rate fluctuation on translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into the Groups functional currency, Sterling.
All material transactional exposures arising through trading in currencies other than the operations functional currency must be eliminated by the use of forward cover contracts as soon as they are known of.
All treasury transactions are carried out only with prime rated counterparties as are investments of cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups customers are mainly from government, government backed institutions or blue chip corporations and as such credit risk is considered small.
Management of capital A range of gearing and liquidity ratios are used to monitor and measure capital structure and performance, including: Net debt to EDITDA defined as net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, Gearing ratio defined as net debt, excluding retirement benefit deficits or surpluses, divided by shareholders funds, ROIC defined as net income divided by total capital equity, excluding retirement benefit deficits or surpluses, plus net debt and EBITDA interest cover defined as profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals divided by net interest payable.
Foreign exchange risk The foreign exchange exposure of Group entities on the net monetary position against their respective functional currencies expressed in the Groups presentation currency is insignificant with the largest exposure being 1.1 million 2009: Sterling to Euro 0.2 million.
Consequently, the pre tax effect on profit and equity, increase or decrease, if the rates moved up or down by an appropriate percentage volatility, assuming all other variables remained constant would in total be 0.1 million 2009: 0.1 million.
The reasonable shifts in exchange rates are based on historic volatility and range from 15% for Sterling to Euro to 30% for South African Rand to Euro and 30% Sterling to US Dollars.

Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The fair values of debt, and related hedging instruments are affected by movements in interest rates.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity in cash flow of interest rate-sensitive instruments to a hypothetical parallel shift of the forward interest rate curves of 50bp 2009: 50bp, with pre tax effect from the beginning of the year.
All other variables are held constant.

Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
The table below analyses the Groups liabilities that will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contract maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances, as the impact of interest is not significant.
