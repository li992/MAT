8 Post-retirement benefits The Company operates three defined benefit plans in the UK.
The largest of them is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trusteeadministered fund.
The Company is the sole employer in that scheme and, accordingly, accounts for it as a defined benefit pension plan, in accordance with FRS 17.
The UK defined benefit pension schemes were closed with effect from 31 October 2009.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the funded scheme was performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2009.
This has been rolled forward to 31 July 2010.
Contributions to the funded scheme are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 31 July 2010 31 July 2009 Rate of increase in salaries n a 3.8% Rate of increase for active deferred members 4.1% n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.2% 3.3% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.2% 3.3% Discount rate 5.4% 5.9% Inflation rate 3.2% 3.3% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 5.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme.
The assumptions are based on the new SAPS All Birth tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with 80% 60% of the long cohort for males females respectively and an annual 1% underpin.
The assumptions are that a member who retires next year at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years after retirement if they are female.
For a member who is currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time they are assumed to live on average for a further 24 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25 years after retirement if they are female.
The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2010 were: 31 July 2010 31 July 2009 Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m Equities 8.2% 783.3 8.2% 589.8 Government bonds 4.2% 22.2 4.5% 46.0 Corporate bonds 5.4% 272.5 5.9% 266.9 Property 7.2% 155.5 7.2% 137.3 Other 4.6% 92.1 5.0% 148.9 Total market value 1,325.6 1,188.9 Present value of funded pension scheme liabilities 1,444.6 1,340.4 Deficit 119.0 151.5 Unfunded pension plans 37.3 36.0 Post-retirement healthcare 8.0 6.2 164.3 193.7 Related deferred tax asset 6.0 Net pension liability 164.3 187.7 The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.

The escrow account remains an asset of the Group see note 4 until 2020.
At that time the assets in escrow are allocated subject to the funding position of the scheme.
In addition, the escrow account may revert to the Group, should there be a surplus at an intervening triennial review.
In addition to the deficit funding, the Group continues to make cash contributions in respect of current service cost based on actuarial advice.
Cash payments in 2011 are expected to be 36m.
