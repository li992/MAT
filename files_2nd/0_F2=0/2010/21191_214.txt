The amortisation increased by 114 million in 2010, mainly in the United States where DAC balances, and the amortisation thereof, are increasing, driven by the growing volumes of business.
Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.
It is estimated that the movement in DAC balance would reduce profit by 115 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by 125 million if yields were to reduce by 1%.
The shadow adjustments relate to deferred acquisition costs on business in the United States backed by investments classified as available for sale.
As explained in accounting policy K, unrealised gains and losses on the AFS investments and the shadow adjustments above are both recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
c Other assets Other assets include 1 million 2009: 1 million that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
d Prepayments and accrued income Prepayments and accrued income of 3,691 million 2009: 3,604 million, include 172 million 2009: 148 million that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
