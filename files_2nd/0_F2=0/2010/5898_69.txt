Share-based payments The Company operates two equity-settled share-based payment schemes across the Fenner PLC Group.
The recognition and measurement principles of FRS 20 Share-based Payment have not been applied to equity instruments that were granted on or prior to 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005, in accordance with the transitional provisions of that standard.
a Fenner PLC 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme Share options were granted to certain employees within the Group.
The exercise price of options granted is set at the market price of the shares on the date of the grant.
The vesting period is generally 3 years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of the grant the options expire.
Options can only be exercised upon satisfaction of performance criteria.
This requires that the overall growth of the Groups earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items over a consecutive three year period exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9%.
The last grant of shares under the Executive Share Option Scheme was made in November 2004.
Details of movements in outstanding share options are as follows: Weighted average Options exercise price number pence At start of year and at end of year 20,406 123.5 At 31 August 2010, 20,406 2009: 20,406 options were exercisable.
The following share options were outstanding at 31 August 2010: Options Option price number pence Dates exercisable 2007 to 2014 20,406 123.5 The weighted average contractual life of outstanding share options at 31 August 2010 is 4.2 years.
The fair value of awards made under the Executive Share Option Scheme is measured using the Binomial option-pricing model.
The following assumptions were used for each set of outstanding options granted after 7 November 2002: Grant date 15 November 2004 Share price at date of grant 130.5p Fair value of options granted 28p Exercise price 123.5p Expected volatility 27% Expected life 6 years Risk free rate 4.6% Expected dividend yield 4.5% Expected volatility is determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Companys share price for a six year period prior to the grant date.

The conditional award is made to each employee at the start of a three year performance period and is based on a percentage of the basic annual salary of each employee.
The awards are subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria.
The proportion of the conditional awards of shares that are awarded is based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR over the performance period compared to the TSR of the comparator group.
