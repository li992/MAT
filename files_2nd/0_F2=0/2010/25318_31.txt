Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary timing differences principally relating to revenue recognition giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
Deferred tax has not been provided on unremitted earnings of the Groups overseas subsidiaries as it is considered that any future distribution will fall within the UKs foreign profits exemption, introduced in July 2009, and hence no exposure to UK tax is expected to arise.

Risks arising from financial instruments Risk management Treasury related risks The Board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations.
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Finance Director, is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority.
Treasury activities and compliance with the treasury policies are reported to the Board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risk: interest rate risk: currency risk: and counterparty risk.
This is to ensure that the Group is properly funded: that interest rate and currency risk is managed within set limits: and that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality.
Policies also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management.
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups underlying business operations.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options.
Liquidity risk The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth.
The short-term nature of the Groups business means that the majority of amounts receivable from customers are receivable within 12 months with an average period to maturity of less than six months.
The risk of not having sufficient liquid resources is therefore low.
The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk further by setting a specific policy parameter that there is sufficient committed debt facilities to cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress-testing for the next 18 months on a rolling basis.
Further, the aim is to ensure that there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity dates: diversification of debt funding sources: that there is no over-reliance on a single or small group of lenders: and that the debt facilities are sufficient for the currency requirements of each country.
At 31 December 2010 the Groups bonds and committed borrowing facilities had an average period to maturity of 3.5 years 2009: 1.4 years.
As shown in note 20 total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2010 were 175.3m 2009: 265.7m.
A maturity analysis of the gross borrowing included in the balance sheet is presented in note 20.
A maturity analysis of bonds, bank borrowings and overdrafts outstanding at the balance sheet date by contractual cash flow, including expected interest payments, is shown below: 2010 2009 Group m m Not later than six months 23.3 98.8 Later than six months and not later than one year 27.6 27.5 Later than one year and not later than two years 33.0 232.6 Later than two years and not later than five years 376.5 460.4 358.9 2010 2009 Company m m Not later than six months 11.5 26.2 Later than six months and not later than one year 23.1 16.9 Later than one year and not later than two years 24.1 65.6 Later than two years and not later than five years 283.6 342.3 108.7 The above analysis includes the contractual cash flow for borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan.
Where borrowings are subject to a floating interest rate an estimate of interest payable is taken.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates in each of its countries of operation and therefore seeks to limit this net exposure.
This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest costs, including fixed rate funding predominantly longer-term bond funding : forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding: bank borrowing loan draw-down periods: and interest rate hedging instruments.
These techniques are used to hedge the interest costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time, up to five years, although most hedging is for up to two years.
Interest costs are a relatively low proportion of the Groups revenue 5.6% in 2010 and therefore the risk of a material variance arising from a change in interest rates is low.
If interest rates across all markets increased by 200 basis points this would have the following impact: 2010 2009 Group m m Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity 4.7 Reduction in profit before tax 1.0 0.9 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: the change in the market interest rate occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and or derivative financial instruments: where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates: and changes in market interest rate affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Currency risk The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: net asset exposure, cash flow exposure and profit and loss exposure.
Net asset exposure The majority of the Groups net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The consolidated balance sheet is reported in sterling and this means that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on the net assets of the Group.
The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets denominated in each foreign currency by funding overseas receivables by borrowings in local currency where possible.
Cash flow exposure The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency.
The policy of the Group is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, they are designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.
Profit and loss exposure As with net assets, the majority of the Groups profit is denominated in currencies other than sterling but translated into sterling for reporting purposes.
The result for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate.
A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rates in the countries in which the Group operates will have a material impact on the consolidated result for the period.
The Group reduces the exposure to this risk by economically hedging a proportion of budgeted profit which results in a currency variance in the trading result being partly offset by a gain or loss on the relevant foreign exchange contract.
The following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the impact on equity of a 5% strengthening or weakening of sterling against all exchange rates for the countries in which the Group operates.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: there is a 5% strengthening weakening of sterling against all currencies in which the Group operates Polish zloty, Czech crown, Euro Slovakia, Hungarian forint, Mexican peso and Romanian leu : and there is no impact on the profit or loss reserve or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk in respect of the amounts receivable from customers: the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks: and foreign currency and derivative contracts.
Amounts receivable from customers The Group lends small amounts over short-term periods to a large and diverse group of customers across the countries in which the Group operates.
Nevertheless, the Group is subject to a risk of material unexpected credit losses in respect of amounts receivable from customers.
This risk is minimised by the use of credit scoring techniques which are designed to ensure the Group only lends to those customers who can afford the repayments.
The amount lent to each customer and the repayment period agreed are dependent upon the risk category the customer is assigned to as part of the scoring process.
The level of expected future losses is generated on a weekly basis by geographical segment.
These outputs are reviewed by management to ensure that appropriate action can be taken if results differ from management expectations.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group only deposits cash, and only undertakes currency and derivative transactions, generally with highly rated banks and sets strict limits in respect of the amount of exposure to any one institution.
Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with full Board approval.
No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows: 2010 2009 Group m m Cash and cash equivalents 23.5 31.2 Amounts receivable from customers 566.9 525.6 Other receivables 21.3 16.3 Total 611.7 573.1 The above table represents a worst case scenario of the credit risk that the Group is exposed to at the year end.
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers by geographical segment is presented in note 16 and of the cash and cash equivalents in note 17.
Cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and other receivables are neither past due nor impaired.
Credit quality of these assets is good and the cash and cash equivalents are spread over a number of banks, each of which meets the criteria set out in our treasury policies, which are explained further in the principal risks section of this report, to ensure the risk of loss is minimised.
Amounts receivable from customers are stated at amortised cost and calculated in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Those amounts receivable from customers that are neither past due nor impaired represent loans where no customer payments have been missed and there is, therefore, no evidence to suggest that the credit quality is anything other than adequate.
The Groups accounting policy in respect of amounts receivable from customers requires that as soon as a customer misses any portion of a contractual payment the account is reviewed for impairment and the receivable is reduced to reflect the revised expected future cash flows.
The result of this is that any loan which is past due where a payment has been missed will attract a deduction for impairment.
Therefore, amounts receivable from customers include no amounts that are past due but not impaired.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers that are individually determined to be impaired is set out by geographical segment below: Not impaired Impaired 2010 2009 2010 2009 Group m m m m Poland 63.0 63.8 174.6 168.5 Czech-Slovakia 44.9 44.7 100.5 85.7 Hungary 26.8 22.2 42.6 41.4 Mexico 17.4 16.7 50.1 44.0 Romania 18.2 15.4 28.8 23.2 170.3 162.8 396.6 362.8 This analysis includes all loans that have been subject to impairment.
The impairment charge is based on the average expected loss for each arrears stage of customer receivables and this average expected loss is applied to the entire arrears stage.
This results in a significant proportion of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge.
For each market the amount by which an asset is impaired depends on the type of product, the recent payment performance and the number of weeks since the loan was issued.
There will therefore be a large amount of receivables which are classed as impaired but where the carrying value is still a large proportion of the contractual amount recoverable.
Annualised impairment as a percentage of revenue for each geographical market is shown below: 2010 2009 Group % % Poland 30.6 28.1 Czech-Slovakia 19.8 20.2 Hungary 15.3 40.2 Mexico 36.5 37.0 Romania 34.7 36.6 The carrying value of amounts receivable from customers that would have been impaired had their terms not been renegotiated is nil 2009: nil.
Capital risk The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business.
The Group is not required to hold regulatory capital.
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong balance sheet but at the same time is providing a good return on capital to its shareholders.
The Groups long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity finance.
Capital is monitored by considering the ratio of equity to receivables and the gearing ratio borrowings to equity.
The capital of the Group and these ratios are shown below: 2010 2009 Group m m Receivables 566.9 525.6 Borrowings 304.3 332.6 Other net assets 46.4 66.8 Equity 309.0 259.8 Equity as % of receivables 54.5% 49.4% Gearing 1.0 1.3 Equity as a percentage of receivables was above the internal minimum requirement set by the Group.
Gearing, which is equal to borrowings divided by net assets, at a ratio of 1.0 times 2009: 1.3 times, is well within covenant limits of 3.75 times.

Derivative financial instruments Fair value estimation IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The fair value of other Group assets and liabilities is included in note 24.
All of the Groups financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 2.
The Groups derivative assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2010 are as follows: Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Assets Interest rate swaps 2.5 Foreign currency contracts 0.1 Total 2.6 Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m Liabilities Interest rate swaps 7.3 2.3 Foreign currency contracts 4.5 0.6 Total 4.5 7.9 2.3 The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 31 December.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps cash flow hedges to hedge those interest cash flows that are expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date and foreign currency contracts cash flow hedges to hedge those foreign currency cash flows that are highly probable to occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The effect on the income statement will also be within these periods.
An amount of 4.1m has been credited to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges 2009: credit of 1.5m, Company: nil 2009: nil.
Foreign currency contracts The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2010 is 192.9m 2009: 59.4m.
These comprise: foreign currency contracts to buy or sell operational currencies against the euro for a total notional amount of 185.5m 2009: 1.5m.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to November 2012 2009: November 2010.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and accordingly the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity: foreign currency contracts to buy or sell various currencies for a total notional amount of 4.9m 2009: 41.9m.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to October 2011 2009: November 2010.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and accordingly the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity: and foreign currency contracts to buy or sell sterling for a total notional amount of 2.5m 2009: 16.0m.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to January 2011 2009: March 2010.
These contracts exactly match the underlying item and therefore the amounts charged credited to the income statement are offset by credits charges in respect of the underlying item.

Derivative financial instruments continued The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Company is committed to at 31 December 2010 is 2.4m 2009: 18.6m.
These comprise: foreign currency contracts to buy and sell various currencies for a total notional amount of 2.4m 2009: 2.6m.
All of these contracts are held with external providers to buy and sell currency and all have equal and offsetting contracts with other Group companies to buy and sell the same amounts of currency.
This leaves the Company with no residual risk and ensures the relevant subsidiary company has an effective foreign currency contract in its books: and foreign currency contracts to buy or sell sterling for a total notional amount of nil 2009: 16.0m.
The 2009 contract had maturities up to March 2010.
There were no outstanding contracts at 31 December 2010.
The Group also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge against forecast profits denominated in foreign currency.
These foreign exchange contracts do not hedge against a specific future cash flow so do not qualify for hedge accounting: changes in their fair value are therefore taken to the income statement.
None of these contracts were outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps The total notional principal of outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group is committed to is 43.4m 2009: 382.5m.
In 2010, these interest rate swaps cover a proportion of current borrowings relating to the floating rate Polish bond.
In 2009 the interest rate swaps related to a proportion of floating rate bank borrowings.
A substantial proportion of these have been replaced by bonds in 2010.
The total notional principal of outstanding interest rate swaps that the Company is committed to is nil 2009: 382.1m.
Interest rate swaps in place at the balance sheet date are designated, and are effective under IAS 39, as cash flow hedges, and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve.
A charge of 7.3m 2009: 1.3m has been made to the income statement in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps and the income statement charge relating to the closure of interest rate swaps.
This includes a 5.3m exceptional charge arising on the closure of interest rate swaps following the issuance of the EMTN and PMTN bonds.

The carrying value of bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of the fair value.
Bank borrowings can be repaid within six months if the Group decides not to rollover for further periods up to the contractual repayment date.
The impact of discounting would therefore be negligible.
The fair value of the bonds has been calculated by reference to their market value.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative transaction.
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes defined benefit In common with many businesses, with effect from 1 March 2010, the Groups defined benefit pension scheme was closed to further accrual of defined benefit obligations, with all members being offered the opportunity to join an existing money purchase scheme.
This crystallised a pension curtailment gain of 2.9m, which is included as a credit within the exceptional item in the consolidated income statement note 10.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value at 31 December 2010.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2010 2009 Group and Company % % Price inflation 3.4 3.5 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries n a 5.0 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.4 3.5 Discount rate 5.3 5.7 Long-term rate of return: equities 7.7 7.9 bonds 5.3 5.5 index-linked gilts 4.2 4.4 overall weighted average 6.4 6.6 The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
Different assumptions are used for different groups of members.
Most members have not yet retired.
On average, we expect a male retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 25 years.
On average, we expect a female retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 29 years.
If life expectancies had been assumed to be one year greater for all members, the charge to the income statement would have increased by 0.1m and the present value of defined benefit obligations would have increased by approximately 1.0m.

Pension schemes defined contribution The defined benefit pension scheme is no longer open to new members.
All eligible UK employees joining are now invited to join a stakeholder pension plan into which the Group contributes between 8% and 20% of members pensionable earnings, provided the employee contributes a minimum of 5%.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The pension charge in the income statement represents contributions payable by the Group in respect of the plan and amounted to 0.5m for the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: 0.3m.
nil of contributions were payable to the plan at the year end 2009: nil.
In addition, an amount of 0.2m 2009: 0.2m has been charged to the income statement in respect of contributions into personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
Share-based payments The Group currently operates three categories of share schemes: The International Personal Finance plc Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan, The International Personal Finance plc Company Share Option Plan the CSOP and The International Personal Finance plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme.
A number of awards have been granted under these schemes during the period under review.
All awards granted under the International Personal Finance plc Exchange Share Scheme the Exchange Scheme vested in 2009.
The income statement charge in respect of the Performance Share Plan and the Company Share Ownership Plan has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these schemes are subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance target.
The income statement charge in respect of the SAYE scheme is calculated using a binominal option pricing model.
The total income statement charge in respect of these share-based payments is 1.7m 2009: 2.0m.
