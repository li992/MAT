k Capital management The over-riding objectives of the Groups capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through the commodity cycle and to maintain an optimal capital structure with a view to maximising returns to shareholders either through ordinary or special dividends, or share buy-backs and benefits to other stakeholders by reducing the Groups cost of capital.
At 31 December 2010, total capital employed which comprises equity shareholders funds, non-controlling interests and borrowings of the Group amounted to $10,038 million, compared to $8,245 million at 31 December 2009.
