9eb` g `X gb time, we actively engage in these markets in order to take commercial advantage of business opportunities.
These trading activities provide not only a source of revenue, but also a further insight into planning, and can, in some cases, give rise to business development opportunities.
3.7 Liquidity and capital resources As a result of our record production volumes and record prices in many of our key commodities over the past several years, we have generated very strong cash flows throughout our operations.
Despite the changing market conditions, our net operating cash flow remained strong and resulted in net debt declining to US$3,308 million.
These cash flows have been fundamental to our ability to internally fund our existing operations, maintain a pipeline of growth projects and return capital to shareholders through dividends.
Our priority for cash is to reinvest in the business.
In line with our strategy, we have grown our business rapidly and consistently through project developments and acquisitions.
Through a combination of borrowings and payments to shareholders, we manage our balance sheet with the goal of maintaining levels of gearing that we believe optimise our costs of capital and return on capital employed.
Net operating cash flows are our principal source of cash.
We also raise cash from debt financing to manage temporary fluctuations in liquidity arrangements and to refinance existing debt.
Our liquidity position is supported by our strong and stable credit rating and committed debt facilities.
1 Cash flow analysis A full consolidated cash flow statement is contained in the financial statements.
The explanatory notes appear in note 23 Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement in the financial statements.
A summary table has been presented below to show the key sources and uses of cash.
2010 2009 2008 US$M US$M US$M Net operating cash flows 17,920 18,863 17,817 Cash outflows from investing activities 11,557 11,328 9,244 Net proceeds from investing activities 542 277 180 Net investing cash flows 11,015 11,051 9,064 Net proceeds from repayment of interest bearing liabilities 485 3,929 408 Share buy-back 3,115 Dividends paid 4,895 4,969 3,250 Other financing activities 73 140 226 Net financing activities 5,307 1,180 6,999 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 1,598 6,632 1,754 Year ended 30 June 2010 compared with year ended 30 June 2009 Net operating cash flow after interest and tax decreased by five per cent to US$17,920 million.
This was primarily driven by changes in working capital balances having a negative year-on-year impact on operating cash flow of US$4,780 million, offset by higher levels of cash generated from operations before changes in working capital balances of US$2,874 million and lower net tax and royalty-related tax payments of US$528 million and a tax refund of US$552 million.
Capital and exploration expenditure totalled US$10,656 million for the period.

Year ended 30 June 2009 compared with year ended 30 June 2008 Net operating cash flow after interest and tax increased by 5.9 per cent to US$18,863 million.
