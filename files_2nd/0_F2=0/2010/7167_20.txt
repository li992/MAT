Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
t Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Hays plc annual RepoRt & Financial statements 2010 75 Financial statements NOTES TO ThE CONSOlIdATEd FINANCIAl STATEMENTS continued 4 Segmental information Adoption of IFRS 8, Operating Segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8, Operating Segments, with effect from 1 July 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result, the Group continues to split the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United Kingdom & Ireland.
The Groups continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of specialist recruitment.
Net fees and profit from continuing operations The Group does not split turnover by segment in internal reports, as remuneration of temporary workers and payments to other recruitment agencies, where the Group acts as principal, are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments.
The Groups chief operating decision maker instead focuses on net fees.
The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 6.
Net fees and profit from continuing operations In s million 2010 2009 Net fees from continuing operations Asia Pacific 146.3 149.1 Continental Europe & Rest of World 167.5 191.0 United Kingdom & Ireland 243.9 330.7 557.7 670.8 2010 Before 2010 exceptional Exceptional In s million items items 2010 2009 Operating profit from continuing operations Asia Pacific 52.0 52.0 61.4 Continental Europe & Rest of World 17.1 1.4 15.7 33.1 United Kingdom & Ireland 11.4 40.0 28.6 63.5 80.5 41.4 39.1 158.0 The Group does not report items below operating profit by segment in the internal management reporting.
The full detail of these items can be seen in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 68.
There is no material difference between the split of the Groups turnover by geographic origin and destination.
Net trade debtors For the purpose of monitoring performance and allocating resources from a balance sheet perspective, the Groups chief operating decision maker only monitors trade debtors net of provisions for impairments on a segment by segment basis.
These are monitored on a constant currency basis for comparability through the year, these are shown below and reconciled to the totals as shown in note 18.

This revenue is generated within the United Kingdom & Ireland.
This is the only customer to exceed 10% of the Groups turnover.
However, as this includes a significant element of remuneration of other recruitment agencies, it represents less than 1.5% of the Groups net fees.

Hays has co-operated fully with the OFT in its investigation under the leniency regime and has been fined 30.4 million which is currently under appeal.
The effect of this fine and legal costs associated with the appeal has been recognised in the Income Statement as an exceptional charge of 29.0 million.
The fine has not yet been paid and a current liability of 30.4 million is held on the Balance Sheet within trade and other payables pending the outcome of the appeal.
The Group incurred a non-recurring restructuring cost of 12.4 million which principally relates to back-office staff redundancy costs of 7.9 million, onerous property leases of 2.5 million and non-cash fixed asset write down of 2.0 million following the near completion of the United Kingdom back-office automation project.
The exceptional charge generated a tax credit of 3.5 million.
The cash impact from the exceptional items as at the balance sheet date was 4.1 million with a further 35.3 million cash outflow expected in the future, primarily during the financial year to 30 June 2011.

Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding operating profit, discount rates and growth rates.
The operating profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by management and management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates.
The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate of 3.0% 2009: 3.0%, reflecting long-term wage inflation driving fee growth.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 12.0% 2009: 12.0%.
In 2009, management used a post-tax discount rate of 9.0%, this translates to a pre-tax rate of 12.0%.
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
Management determined that there has been no impairment.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes in long-term growth rate from 0% to 5%.
In the United Kingdom & Ireland group of CGUs, the carrying value in respect of the UK RSG acquisition of 15.3 million is in line with its value in use.
The sensitivity analysis, based on a 0.5% change in discount rate, equated to a circa 0.9 million change in the value in use.
A 1% change in growth rate equated to a circa 0.5 million change in the value in use.
An increase in discount rate to 13% with no growth would lead to a potential impairment of 4.5 million.
Management will continue to monitor this acquisition but, based on the potential for growth in excess of the estimates being at least as likely as an increase in discount rates, they do not consider impairment appropriate.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the other CGUs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: In s million 2010 2009 Asia Pacific 23.9 19.9 Continental Europe & Rest of World 59.9 62.6 United Kingdom & Ireland 101.8 92.4 185.6 174.9 82 Hays plc annual RepoRt & Financial statements 2010 DiRectoRs RepoRt Business Review DiRectoRs RepoRt GoveRnance RemuneRation RepoRt GoveRnance Financial statements 15 Other intangible assets In s million 2010 2009 Cost At 1 July 48.7 14.1 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.3 Additions 26.2 34.6 Disposals 0.3 At 30 June 75.0 48.7 Amortisation At 1 July 10.1 8.7 Exchange adjustments 0.2 Charge for year 2.8 1.2 At 30 June 12.9 10.1 Net book value At 30 June 62.1 38.6 All other intangible assets relate to computer software.

These assets relate to the Groups projects to transform its software.
The estimated average useful life of the intangible assets is seven years 2009: five years.
The increase in useful life compared to last year is due to software incorporated into major ERP implementations which is amortised over a life of up to seven years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so and they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority either on the same taxable entity or entities which intend to settle current tax assets or liabilities on a net basis.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 33.2 million 2009: 36.1 million available for offset against future profits, of which 6.2 million relates to United Kingdom capital losses, 8.4 million relates to otherwise unrelievable EU losses potentially relievable against United Kingdom profits and 18.6 million relates to overseas losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses 2009: nil.
Of these unrecognised tax losses, 0.7 million is due to expire between 2012 and 2018 and 32.5 million is unlikely to expire in the short-term.
The United Kingdom government has announced that the rate of corporation tax will reduce from 28% to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011.
If this change had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2010, the Groups deferred tax asset would have been reduced by 0.7 million, with 0.6 million charged to equity and 0.1 million charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Group has no unused tax credits available for offset against future profits 2009: 3.1 million.
No deferred tax asset was recognised in respect of these credits in the prior year.
The reduction compared to last year is due to a change in the United Kingdom tax legislation.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries on which deferred tax liabilities have not been provided is 2.9 million.
The temporary differences at 30 June 2010 are reduced from the previous year as a result of the change in United Kingdom tax legislation which largely exempts from United Kingdom tax, overseas dividends received after 1 July 2009.
The temporary differences at 30 June 2010 represents only the un-remitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend with-holding taxes levied by the jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group reduces risk through its credit control process and by contractual arrangements with other recruitment agencies in situations where the Group invoice on their behalf.
The Groups exposure is spread over a large number of customers.

This new facility expires in January 2014.
Fair values of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts The fair value of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts is not materially different to their book value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments, which are based on floating rates.
Committed facilities The Group had a 460 million unsecured revolving credit facility available which was renewed on 1 July 2010 as detailed in note 33.
The covenants in the facility as at the balance sheet date required the Groups interest cover to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA to be no greater than 3:1.
The interest rate on the facility was based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 0.375% to 0.525%.
At 30 June 2010, 315.0 million of the committed facility was undrawn.
Capital management The Boards current priorities for the Groups fee cash flow are to fund Group development, maintain the strength of the balance sheet and to support a sustainable dividend policy.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from last year in that it manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns through the economic cycle.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents note 19, the bank loans and overdraft note 20 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 24 to 28.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.

22 Retirement benefit obligations Within the UK, the Group operates one defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
UK Defined Contribution Scheme The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001.
Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary depending on the level of employee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 2.3 million 2009: 1.4 million represents employers contributions payable to the Stakeholder Pension Plan.
Contributions of 0.2 million 2009: 0.1 million were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the Stakeholder Pension Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
UK Defined Benefit Schemes i The Hays Pension Scheme, is a defined benefit scheme where the benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
It is a funded approved defined benefit scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001.
It is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
ii T he Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2009 although this has not yet been finalised.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme to 30 June 2010 and a valuation of the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme have been performed by an independent actuary, and employee of Mercer.
The key assumptions used at 30 June 2010 are listed below.
IAS 19 accounting valuation Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Consolidated Income Statement, in retained earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The key assumptions are as follows: 2010 2009 Inflation assumption 3.35% 3.65% Discount rate 5.43% 6.35% Rate of increase in salaries 3.60% 3.90% Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.35% 3.65% Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets 5.97% 6.46% 88 Hays plc annual RepoRt & Financial statements 2010 DiRectoRs RepoRt Business Review DiRectoRs RepoRt GoveRnance RemuneRation RepoRt GoveRnance Financial statements The assumption for the expected long-term returns for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance charge income.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1NA generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an underpin to future improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments minus 0.5 years for male pensioners.
This assumes that a 65-year-old male current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.5 years.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the defined benefit schemes are as follows: In s million 2010 2009 Current service cost 4.1 4.5 Expected return on pension scheme assets 21.0 24.8 Interest on pension liabilities 27.7 27.2 Net financial charge 6.7 2.4 Total amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement 10.8 6.9 The actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as follows: In s million 2010 2009 Actuarial gain losses on scheme assets 37.2 78.2 Actuarial gain losses on scheme liabilities 52.2 12.4 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 42.0 69.4 Net gain expense recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 47.4 21.2 In s million 2010 2009 Deficit in the scheme brought forward 109.2 88.1 Current service cost 4.1 4.5 Contributions 5.5 7.0 Net financial return 6.7 2.4 Actuarial gain loss 47.4 21.2 Deficit in the scheme carried forward 67.1 109.2 The amount included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of its defined benefit retirement schemes is as follows: In s million 2010 2009 Present value of defined benefit obligations 445.3 439.1 Fair value of scheme assets 378.2 329.9 Defined benefit scheme deficit 67.1 109.2 Liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 67.1 109.2 Hays plc annual RepoRt & Financial statements 2010 89 Financial statements NOTES TO ThE CONSOlIdATEd FINANCIAl STATEMENTS continued 22 Retirement benefit obligations continued Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligations are as follows: In s million 2010 2009 Change in benefit obligation Balance at 1 July 439.1 474.8 Current service cost 4.1 4.5 Interest cost 27.7 27.1 Members contributions 0.6 1.4 Actuarial gains losses 52.2 12.4 Changes in assumptions 42.0 69.3 Benefits paid 14.2 11.8 Expenses paid 1.8 Benefit obligation at 30 June 445.3 439.1 Analysis of defined benefit obligation Plans that are wholly or partly funded 437.8 432.2 Plans that are wholly unfunded 7.5 6.9 Total 445.3 439.1 Changes in the fair value of scheme assets are as follows: Fair value of plan assets at 1 July 329.9 386.7 Expected return on plan assets 21.0 24.8 Actuarial gains losses 37.2 78.2 Employer contributions 5.5 7.0 Member contributions 0.6 1.4 Benefits paid 14.2 11.8 Expenses paid 1.8 Fair value of plan assets at 30 June 378.2 329.9 The change in the deficit is mainly attributable to higher than expected asset returns, the experience gains on the liabilities offset by the change in assumptions to more closely align with the updated actuarial assumptions and a decrease in net yield discount rate versus inflation rate.
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected return at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date was as follows: 2010 2009 2010 Expected 2009 Expected Fair value return Fair value return s million % s million % Equities 196.7 7.30% 170.5 7.50% Bonds & Gilts 166.4 4.90% 157.7 5.40% Other 15.1 0.50% 1.7 0.50% 378.2 5.97% 329.9 6.46% To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption used in determining the net pension cost for the year to June 2010, the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the rate of return on AA rated corporate bonds, the level of risk premium associated with the other assets classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class at 30 June 2009.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 6.46% assumption for the year end 30 June 2010.

Performance Share Plan PSP and Deferred Annual Bonus DAB The PSP is designed to link reward to the key long-term value drivers of the business and to align the interests of the executive directors and approximately 350 of the global senior management population with the long-term interests of shareholders.
PSP awards are discretionary and vesting is dependent on the achievement of performance conditions measured over either a three-year period or a one-year period with a two-year holding period.
Only the executive directors and other members of the Management Board participate in the DAB which promotes a stronger link between short-term and long-term performance through deferral of annual bonuses into shares for a three-year period.
Further details of the schemes for the executive directors can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 65.
