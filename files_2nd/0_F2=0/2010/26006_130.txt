Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 budget statement.
The Finance No 2 Act 2010 which was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, includes legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28 per cent.
The deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2010 are therefore stated at 27 per cent.
Further reductions to the main rate were announced during the March 2011 budget statement to reduce the rate further to 26 per cent.
from 1 April 2011 then by 1 per cent.
These proposed reductions are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes if applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 December 2010, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by 1.6m being 1.4m recognised in 2011, 0.3m recognised in 2012 and a 0.1m credit recognised in 2013.
As these changes to the main rate of corporation tax were not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, their impact is not included within the closing deferred tax balances.
