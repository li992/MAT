268 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48 Pension obligations This note describes the Groups pension arrangements for its employees and explains how our obligations to these schemes are calculated.
a Introduction The Group operates a large number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world.
The only material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the main UK scheme is by far the largest.
This note gives full IAS 19 disclosures for these schemes whilst the smaller ones, while still measured under IAS 19, are included as one total within Provisions see note 47.
Similarly, while the charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section e iv below, the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section d below.
The assets of the main UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which invests in the life funds of the Group.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members.
Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.

New entrants join the defined contribution section of the ASPS, as the defined benefit section is closed.
This scheme is operated by a trustee company, with 11 trustee directors, comprising representatives of the employers, staff, pensioners and an independent trustee referred to below as the trustees.
On 20 October 2010, following formal consultation, the Group confirmed its decision to close the final salary sections of both UK schemes with effect from 1 April 2011, with entry into the defined contribution sections being offered to the staff members affected.
The consequential reduction in the liabilities of both schemes, arising from projecting forward salaries using estimates of inflation rather than salary inflation, is 320 million.
Additional contributions to affected members defined contribution accounts and implementation costs have resulted in an overall gain on closure of 286 million, which is considered a profit arising in 2010.
Closure of the schemes removes the volatility associated with adding future accrual for active members and will also lead to lower service costs and their expected cash funding from 2011 onwards.
