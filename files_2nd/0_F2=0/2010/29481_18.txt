Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES St. Jamess Place plc the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
Statement of Compliance The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC.
The following new and amended standard, which the Group has adopted as of 1 January 2010, has not had any material impact on the Groups reported results: IFRS 2 Amendment Group cash settled share-based payment transactions As at 31 December 2010, the following standards and interpretation, which are relevant to the Group but have not been applied in the financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IAS 12 Amendment Income taxes IAS 24 Revised Related party disclosures IAS 27 Amendment Consolidated and separate financial statements IAS 32 Amendment Financial instruments: Presentation IAS 39 Amendment Financial instruments recognition and measurement IFRS 7 Amendment Financial instruments: Disclosures IFRS 9 Financial instruments Classification and measurement IFRIC 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to owners The adoption of the above standards and interpretation is not expected to have any material impact on the Groups results reported within the financial statements other than requiring additional disclosure or alternative presentation.
The Group financial statements also comply with the revised Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers in December 2005 as amended in December 2006, in so far as these requirements do not contradict IFRS requirements.
Basis of Preparation As discussed in the Directors Report, the going concern basis has been adopted in preparing these accounts.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand pounds.
They are prepared on a historical cost basis except for assets classified as investment property, investments and currency forwards, and liabilities classified as investment contracts, insurance contracts and third party holdings in unit trusts, which are held at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.

3183415 74 Financial Statements The consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2009 has been re-presented to better present fee and commission income to disclose all fund related income which, had in part, been previously netted off against investment contract benefits.
The impact on the consolidated income statement has been to increase fee and commission income and to increase investment contract benefits by 267.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2009.
There has been no impact on the profit attributable to the shareholders of the Company.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in Note 2.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the assets, liabilities and the results of the Company and of its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the financial and operating policies in order to gain benefits from its activities including unit trusts in which the Group holds more than half of the units.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.
Intragroup balances, and any income and expenses or unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Product classification The Groups products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance contracts or investment contracts.
i Insurance contracts Insurance contracts are contracts that transfer significant insurance risk.
The Groups product range includes a variety of term assurance and whole of life protection contracts involving significant insurance risk transfer.
ii Investment contracts Contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are treated as investment contracts.
The majority of the business written by the Group is unit linked investment business and is classified as investment contracts.
c Long-term business i Insurance premium revenue For unit linked insurance contracts, premiums are recognised as revenue when the liabilities arising from them are recognised.
All other premiums are accounted for when due for payment.
Investment contract premiums are not included in the income statement but are reported as deposits to investment contract liabilities in the balance sheet.
ii Revenue from investment contracts Fees charged for services related to the management of investment contracts are recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
Initial fees, including dealing margins from unit trusts, which exceed the level of recurring fees and relate to the future provision of services, are deferred.
These are amortised over the anticipated period in which services will be provided.
iii Policy claims and benefits For insurance contracts, death claims are accounted for on notification of death.
Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted.
All other claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 75 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards continued 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED For investment contracts, benefits paid are not included in the income statement but are instead deducted from investment contract liabilities.
The movement in investment contract benefits within the income statement principally represents the investment return credited to policyholders.
iv Acquisition costs For insurance contracts, acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as initial commission and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
Acquisition costs which are incurred during a financial year, net of any impairment losses, are deferred and then amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable and in accordance with the incidence of future related margins.
For investment contracts, only directly attributable acquisition costs, which vary with and are related to securing new contracts and renewing existing contracts, are deferred to the extent that they are recoverable out of future revenue.
These deferred acquisition costs, which represent the contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services, net of any impairment losses, are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected lifetime of the Groups investment contracts.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
v Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contract liability provisions are determined following an annual actuarial investigation of the long-term fund in accordance with regulatory requirements.
The provisions are calculated on the basis of current information and using the gross premium valuation method.
The Groups accounting policies for insurance contracts meet the minimum specified requirements for liability adequacy testing under IFRS 4, as they consider current estimates of all contractual cash flows, and of related cash flow such as claims handling costs.
Insurance contract liabilities can never be definitive as to their timing nor the amount of claims and are therefore subject to subsequent reassessment on a regular basis.
vi Investment contract liabilities All of the Groups investment contracts are unit linked.
Unit linked liabilities are measured at fair value by reference to the value of the underlying net asset value of the Groups unitised investment funds, determined on a bid value, at the balance sheet date.
An allowance for future tax to be paid or recovered in respect of capital gains and losses in the unit linked funds, discounted to reflect the time period over which such gains and losses are expected to be realised for tax purposes, is also reflected in the measurement of unit linked liabilities.
Investment contract liabilities are recognised when units are first allocated to the policyholder: they are derecognised when units allocated to the policyholder have been cancelled.
The decision by the Group to designate its unit linked liabilities as fair value through the profit and loss statement reflects the fact that the underlying investment portfolio is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis.
vii Insurance and investment contract receivables and payables Insurance and investment contract receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses.
d Reinsurance Reinsurance premiums are accounted for when due for payment and reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
Reinsurance assets represent amounts recoverable from reinsurers in respect of claims and in respect of insurance contract liabilities, net of any future reinsurance premiums payable and after allowance for any impairment losses.
e Fee and commission income Fee and commission income primarily consists of management fees on investment contracts see accounting policy note c ii and commission due in respect of products sold on behalf of third parties.
Commission is recognised in full on acceptance and inception of the policy by the product provider.
Where the product provider retains the right to clawback of commission on an indemnity basis, turnover on sale of these products is recognised net of a provision for the estimated clawback.
3183415 76 Financial Statements f Investment return Investment return comprises investment income and investment gains and losses.
Investment income includes dividends, interest and rental income from investment properties under operating leases.
Dividends are accrued on an ex-dividend basis, and rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Interest, which is generated on assets classified as fair value through profit and loss, is accounted for on an accruals basis.
g Expenses i Commission Commission expense is recognised in respect of manufactured insurance and investment business, together with third party products.
Commission comprises initial commission paid at policy outset within the initial period, renewal commission payable on regular contributions and trail commission based on funds under management and payable on the policy anniversary.
Initial and renewal commission are recognised in line with the associated premium income, but initial commission on insurance and investment contracts may be deferred as set out in accounting policy c iv.
Trail commission is recognised on an accruals basis.
Commission in respect of some insurance and investment business may be paid in advance on renewal premiums and accelerated by up to five years.
The unearned element of this accelerated commission is recognised as an asset within other receivables.
Should the contributions reduce or stop within the initial period, any unearned commission is clawed back.
ii Operating lease payments Leases where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership is retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense and are spread over the life of the lease.
h Income taxes Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax payable by the Group in respect of policyholders and shareholders.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
i Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
iii Policyholder and shareholder tax The total income tax charge is a separate adjustment within the income statement based on the movement in current and deferred income taxes in respect of income, gains and expenses.
The allocation between shareholders and policyholders is based on the returns recognised within these categories.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 77 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards continued 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED i Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid, and, for the final dividend, when approved by the Companys shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
j Intangible assets i Deferred acquisition costs See accounting policy note c iv.
ii Acquired value of in-force business The acquired value of in-force business in respect of insurance business represents the present value of profits that are expected to emerge from insurance business acquired on business combinations.
It is calculated at the time of acquisition using best estimate actuarial assumptions for interest, mortality, persistency and expenses, net of any impairment losses, and it is amortised as profits emerge over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
An intangible asset is also recognised in respect of acquired investment management contracts representing the fair value of contractual rights acquired under those contracts.
The acquired value of in-force business is expressed as a gross figure in the balance sheet with the associated tax included within deferred tax liabilities.
It is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and any movement is charged to the income statement.
iii Computer software Computer software is recognised as an intangible asset during development and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful life of four years, commencing when the software is operational.
Computer software is stated at cost less amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
The carrying value is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
k Property & equipment Items of property & equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses see accounting policy note p. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
The deemed cost of owner occupied property is the fair value determined by an independent valuer at the date of transition to IFRS.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement to administration expenses on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the property & equipment as follows: Computers: 3 years Fixtures and fittings: 5 years Office equipment: 5 years Motor vehicles: 4 years Buildings: 50 years Land is not depreciated.
l Investment property Investment properties, which are all held within the unit linked funds, are properties which are held to earn rental income and or for capital appreciation.
They are stated at fair value.
An external, independent valuer, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued, values the portfolio every month.
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Rental income from investment property is accounted for as described in accounting policy note f. St. Jamess Place plc Registered No.
3183415 78 Financial Statements m Investments The Groups investments are all classified at fair value through profit and loss, with all gains and losses recognised within investment income in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial investments, which represent the vast majority of the Groups investments, are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial investment is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques such as recent arms length transactions, reference to similar listed investments, discounted cash flow models or option pricing models.
The decision by the Group to designate its investments at fair value through the profit and loss reflects the fact that the investment portfolio is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis.
The Group recognises purchases and sales of investments on trade date.
The costs associated with investment transactions are included within administration expenses in the income statement.
n Currency forwards The Group uses currency forwards within some unit linked funds to hedge exposure to foreign currency.
Each contract is recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with all changes in value recognised within investment income in the income statement.
o Other receivables Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost less impairment losses.
The value of any impairment recognised is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
p Impairment policy Formal reviews to assess the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs on insurance and investment contracts, the acquired value of in-force business and loans are carried out at each balance sheet date.
The recoverability of such assets is measured and the asset is deemed impaired if the projected future margins are less than the carrying value of the asset.
The carrying amounts of the Groups other assets that are not carried at fair value are also reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If there is any indication of irrecoverability or impairment, the assets recoverable amount is estimated based on the present value of its estimated future cash flows.
Impairment losses are reversed through the income statement if there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Such losses are reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation where applicable, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
q Cash & cash equivalents Cash & cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments, and bank overdrafts to the extent that they are an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Cash & cash equivalents held within unit linked and unit trust funds are classified at fair value through the profit and loss.
All other cash & cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables.
r Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events such that it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are measured as the discounted expected future cash flows taking account of the risks and uncertainties associated with the specific liability where appropriate.
The Group recognises provisions for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 79 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards continued 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED s Borrowings Borrowings are measured initially at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period on an effective interest rate basis.
Borrowings are recognised on drawdown and derecognised on repayment.
t Other payables Other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
u Net asset value attributable to unit holders The Group consolidates unit trusts in which it holds more than half of the units.
The third party interests in these unit trusts are measured at fair value, since the underlying investment portfolios are managed on a fair value basis, and they are presented in the balance sheet as net asset value attributable to unit holders.
Income attributable to the third party interests is accounted for within investment income, offset by a corresponding change in investment contract benefits.
v Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Group operates a defined contribution personal pension plan for its employees.
Contributions to this plan are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share-based payment plans.
The fair value of equity instruments granted is recognised as an expense spread over the vesting period of the instrument which accords with the period for which related services are provided, with a corresponding increase in equity in the case of equity settled plans.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards at the grant date, measured using standard option pricing models.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest and it recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, such that the amount recognised for employee services are based on the number of shares that actually vest.
The charge to the income statement is not revised for any changes in market vesting conditions.
w Treasury shares Where any Group company purchases the Companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders, as disclosed in the Treasury Shares reserve.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.
x Foreign currency translation The Groups presentational and functional currency is pounds sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gain or losses on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities which are held at historical cost are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the date of transaction: those held at fair value are translated using exchange rates ruling at the date on which the fair value was determined.
y Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of the Company.
3183415 80 Financial Statements z Current and non-current disclosure Assets which are expected to be recovered or settled no more than twelve months after the balance sheet date are disclosed as current within the notes to the accounts.
Those expected to be recovered or settled more than twelve months after the balance sheet date are disclosed as non-current.
Liabilities which are expected and due to be settled no more than twelve months after the balance sheet date are disclosed as current within the notes to the accounts.
Those liabilities which are expected and due to be settled more than twelve months after the balance sheet date are disclosed as non-current.
Deferred tax balances are all treated as non-current.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES Judgements The primary area in which the Group has applied judgement in applying accounting policies lies in the classification of contracts between insurance and investment business.
Contracts with a significant degree of insurance risk are treated as insurance.
All other contracts are treated as investment contracts.
The Group has also elected to treat all assets backing linked and non unit linked contracts as fair value through profit or loss although some of the assets in question may ultimately be held to maturity.
Estimates The principal areas in which the Group applies accounting estimates are: Determining the value of insurance contract liabilities.
Deciding the amount of management expenses that are treated as acquisition expenses.
Amortisation and recoverability of deferred acquisition costs and deferred income.
Determining the fair value, amortisation and recoverability of acquired in-force business.
Determining the fair value liability to policyholders for capital losses in unit funds.
Estimates are also applied in determining the amount of deferred tax asset recognised on unrelieved expenses and the value of other provisions.
Measurement of insurance contract liabilities The assumptions used in the calculation of insurance contract liabilities that have a significant effect on the income statement of the Group are: The lapse assumption, which is set prudently based on an investigation of experience during the year.
The level of expenses, which is based on actual expenses in 2010 and expected long term rates.
The mortality and morbidity rates, which are based on the results of an investigation of experience during the year.
The assumed rate of investment return, which is based on current gilt rates.
Greater detail on the assumptions applied is shown in Note 18.
Acquisition expenses Certain management expenses vary with the level of sales and have been treated as acquisition costs.
Each line of costs has been reviewed and its variability to sales volumes estimated on the basis of the level of costs that would be incurred if sales ceased.
Amortisation and recoverability of Deferred Acquisition Costs DAC and Deferred Income DIR Deferred acquisition costs and income on investment contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected lifetime of the underlying contracts.
The expected lifetime of the contracts has been estimated from the experienced termination rates and the age of clients at inception and maturity.
Deferred acquisition costs and income on insurance contracts are amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable in accordance with the projected emergence of future margins.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 81 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards continued 2.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deferred acquisition costs relating to insurance and investment contracts are tested annually for recoverability by reference to expected future income levels.
Acquired in-force business There have been no new business combinations during the year.
The acquired value of the in-force business is amortised on a basis that reflects the expected profit stream arising from the business acquired at the date of acquisition.
This profit stream is estimated from the experienced termination rates, expenses of management and age of the clients under the individual contracts as well as global estimates of investment growth, based on recent experience at the date of acquisition.
The acquired value of in-force business relating to insurance and investment contracts is tested annually for recoverability by reference to expected future income levels.
Valuing capital losses in unit funds In line with IAS 12 the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset in relation to capital losses at the balance sheet date.
This asset has been tested for impairment against the level of capital gains realistically expected to arise in future.
Much of the benefit of the deferred tax asset on capital losses will be shared with policyholders.
The policyholder investment contract liability has therefore been increased to reflect the fair value of this additional benefit.
The assumptions that have a significant effect on the fair value of the liability are as follows: The assumed rate of investment return, which is based on current gilt rates.
The lapse assumption, which is set prudently based on experience during the year.
The assumed period for development of capital gains, which is estimated from recent experience.
SEGMENT REPORTING IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance.
The Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: 1.
Life business offering pensions, protection and investment products through the Groups life assurance subsidiaries.
Unit Trust business offering unit trust investment products, including ISAs, through the St. Jamess Place Unit Trust Group.
Distribution business the distribution network for the St. Jamess Place life and unit trust products as well as financial products such as annuities, mortgages and stakeholder pensions, from third party providers.
The figures for segment income provided to the chief operating decision maker in respect of the distribution business relate to the distribution of the products of third party providers only.
The figures for segment profit provided to the chief operating decision maker take account of fees and commissions payable by the life business and unit trust business to the distribution business.
Other all other group activities.
Separate geographical segmental information is not presented since the Group does not segment its business geographically, its customers being based and its assets managed predominantly in the United Kingdom.
3183415 82 Financial Statements The income, profit and assets of these segments are set out below.

Assumptions used in the calculation of liabilities The principal assumptions used in the calculation of the liabilities are: Assumption Description Interest rate The valuation interest rate is calculated by reference to the long term gilt yield at 31 December 2010 and the specific gilts backing the liabilities.
The specific rates used are between 2.7% and 3.9% depending on the tax regime 3.0% and 4.1% at 31 December 2009.
Mortality Mortality is based on Company experience and is set at 72% of the TM F92 tables with an additional loading for smokers.
There has been no change since 2006.
Morbidity Morbidity is based on Company experience.

Annual Cost Product 2010 2009 Protection business 35.43 34.22 Persistency Allowance is made for a prudent level of lapses within the calculation of the liabilities.
The rates have not changed in 2010.
Sample annual lapse rates are: Lapses 2009 & 2010 Year 1 Year 5 Year 10 Protection 7% 9% 8% Sensitivity analysis The table below sets out the sensitivity of the profit on insurance business and net assets to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.
The analysis reflects the change in the variable assumption shown while all other variables assumptions are left unchanged.
In practice variables assumptions may change at the same time as some may be correlated for example, an increase in interest rates may also result in an increase in expenses if the increase reflects higher inflation.
It should also be noted that in some instances sensitivities are non-linear.

Fair value estimation Financial instruments, which are held at fair value in the balance sheet, are required to have disclosed their fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs Level 3.

These instruments are included in Level 1.
Instruments included in Level 1 comprise primarily listed equity instruments.
The Group closely monitors the valuation of assets in markets that have become less liquid.
Determining whether a market is active requires the exercise of judgement and is determined based upon the facts and circumstances of the market for the instrument being measured.
Where it is determined that there is no active market, fair value is established using a valuation technique.
The techniques applied incorporate relevant information available and reflect appropriate adjustments for credit and liquidity risks.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The relative weightings given to differing sources of information and the determination of non-observable inputs to valuation models can require the exercise of significant judgement.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
3183415 100 Financial Statements Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: The use of observable prices for recent arms length transactions.

Sensitivity analysis to market risks The majority of the Groups business is unit linked and the direct associated market risk is therefore borne by policyholders although there is a secondary impact as shareholder income is dependent upon the markets.
Financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds primarily consist of fixed interest securities, units in money market funds, cash and cash equivalents, and other assets and liabilities.
The fixed interest securities are held to match non linked liabilities and the liability values move broadly in line with the matching asset values such that fair value interest rate risk is immaterial, although these is some residual risk due to imperfect matching.
Cash held in unitised money market funds and at bank is valued at par and is unaffected by movement in interest rates.
Other assets and liabilities are similarly unaffected by market movements.
As a result of these combined factors, the Groups financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds are not materially subject to market risk, and movements at the balance sheet date in interest rates and equity values have an immaterial impact on the Groups profit after tax and equity.
Future profits from annual management charges may be affected by movements in interest rates and equity values.
Currency risk The Group is not subject to any significant currency risk since all material shareholder financial assets and financial liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base in order to: protect policyholders and creditors interests: support the development of its business and create shareholder value: and meet regulatory requirements at all times.
Within the Group each subsidiary manages its own capital in the context of the Group capital plan.
Capital generated in excess of planned requirements is returned to the Groups parent, St. Jamess Place plc, normally by way of dividends.
The Group capital plan is monitored by the Finance Capital Management Committee on behalf of the St. Jamess Place plc Board.
The Groups policy is for each Company to hold the higher of: the Companys internal assessment of the capital required: and the capital requirement of the relevant supervisory body plus a specified margin over this to absorb changes.
Generally, because of the nature of the business and the current regulatory rules, the higher requirement is that of the supervisory body plus the specified margin.
The following entities are under supervisory regulation and have to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital: Entity Regulatory Body and Jurisdiction St. Jamess Place UK plc FSA: Long-term insurance business St. Jamess Place International plc Central Bank of Ireland: Life insurance business St. Jamess Place Unit Trust Group Limited FSA: UCITS Management Company St. Jamess Place Wealth Management plc FSA: Personal Investment Firm St. Jamess Place Reinsurance Limited Central Bank of Ireland: Reinsurance St. Jamess Place Reassurance 2009 Limited FSA: Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Monaco SAM Monaco: Commission for Control of Financial Activities St. Jamess Place Trust Company Jersey Limited Jersey Financial Services Commission St. Jamess Place Wealth Management PCIS Limited FSA: Securities and Futures The FSA regulatory requirement for St. Jamess Place UK plc SJPUK, which makes up the majority of the Group capital requirement, includes the prescribed minimum solvency margin requirement the Capital Resources Requirement CRR and an assessment of the risks faced under the business, known as the Individual Capital Assessment.
The capital requirement is assessed and monitored by the Actuarial Committee, a committee of the SJPUK Board.
The regulatory requirements for the remaining companies within the Group are assessed and monitored by the relevant Board.
There has been no material change in the Groups management of capital during the period and all regulated entities exceed the minimum solvency requirements at the balance sheet date.
Capital composition The principal forms of capital are included in the following balances on the consolidated balance sheet: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 million million Share capital 72.9 72.3 Share premium 98.1 90.5 Treasury shares reserve 8.2 7.7 Miscellaneous reserves 2.3 2.3 Retained earnings 421.2 382.4 586.3 539.8 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 105 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards continued 27.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION CONTINUED The above assets do not all qualify as regulatory capital.
Analysis of the assets which do qualify as regulatory capital is given in Section 3 of the Financial Commentary on page 21.
The Group and its individually regulated operations have complied with all externally and internally imposed capital requirements throughout the period.
SHARE CAPITAL Number of Share Ordinary Shares Capital million At 1 January 2009 479,552,860 71.9 Scrip dividend 798,315 0.1 Exercise of options 1,680,612 0.3 At 31 December 2009 482,031,787 72.3 Scrip dividend 782,813 0.1 Exercise of options 3,334,586 0.5 At 31 December 2010 486,149,186 72.9 The total authorised number of ordinary shares is 605 million 2009: 605 million, with a par value of 15 pence per share 2009: 15 pence per share.
All issued shares are fully paid.
Included in the issued share capital are 3,038,633 2009: 2,824,647 shares held in the Treasury Shares Reserve with a nominal value of 0.5 million 2009: 0.4 million.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS During the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group operated a number of different equity settled share-based payment arrangements, which are aggregated as follows: SAYE plan this is a standard HMRC approved scheme that is available to all employees where individuals may contribute up to 250 per month over three years to purchase shares at a price not less than 80% of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.
Executive deferred bonus schemes under these plans the deferred element of the annual bonus is used to purchase shares at market value in the Company.
The shares are held by the Company until vesting after three years and, in addition to the performance targets, which apply prior to any entitlement being granted, further performance conditions may also apply on vesting.
Executive performance share plan the Remuneration Committee of the Group Board may make awards of performance shares to the Executive Directors and other senior managers.
Two-thirds of shares awarded to Directors are subject to an earnings growth condition of the Group and one-third of shares awarded to Directors are subject to a comparative total shareholder return TSR condition, both measured over a three year period.
Further information regarding the vesting conditions of the earnings growth and total shareholder return dependent portions of the award is given in the Remuneration Report on page 59.
Awards made to senior managers are largely only subject to the earnings growth condition of the Group.
Executive and sales management share option schemes these include both approved and unapproved elements and vest after three or five year periods subject to satisfying personal and or Group earnings performance.
The last award under these schemes was made in 2005.
Partner share option schemes these were offered to the Partners of the St. Jamess Place Partnership and vest over three to six years subject to satisfying personal sales related performance criteria.
The last award under these schemes was made in 2007.
Partner performance share plan a new scheme was launched in January 2008 whereby Partners are entitled to purchase shares in the future at nominal value 15p.
The number of shares the Partners are entitled to purchase will depend on their personal sales production in the year of the award and validation over the following three years.
3183415 106 Financial Statements Share options outstanding under the various share option schemes at 31 December 2010 amount to 34.6 million shares 2009: 38.1 million.
Of these, 25.3 million are under option to Partners of the St. Jamess Place Partnership, 7.4 million are under option to executives and senior management including 3.5 million under option to Directors as disclosed in the Remuneration Report on page 63 and 1.9 million are under option through the SAYE scheme.
These are exercisable on a range of future dates.
The table below summarises the share-based payment awards made in 2009 and 2010: Executive Executive Partner Deferred Performance Performance SAYE Bonus Share Plan Share Plan Awards in 2009: Date of grant 27 March 4 March Various 24 February Number granted 1,634,068 490,932 2,131,754 3,320,000 Awards in 2010: Date of grant 22 March 10 March Various 25 February Number granted 323,129 1,151,682 2,108,585 675,000 Contractual life 3.5 years 3 years 3.5 years 4 years Vesting conditions 3 year saving period 3 years service 3 years service Sales production for and achievement of and achievement of year of award personal targets in earnings and TSR and subsequent some instances targets validation over following 3 years Financial assumptions underlying the calculation of fair value The fair value expense has been based on the fair value of the instruments granted, as calculated using appropriate derivative pricing models.
The table below shows the assumptions and models used to calculate the grant date fair value of each award: Executive Executive Partner Deferred Performance Performance SAYE Bonus Share Plan Share Plan Valuation model Black Black Monte Black Scholes Scholes Carlo Scholes Awards in 2009: 2 4 Fair value pence 59.14 182.5 124.45 190.0 166.25 5 Share price pence 168.00 182.5 176.0 to 190.0 190.0 Exercise price pence 150.00 0.00 0.00 0.15 1 Expected volatility % pa 50 N A 50 50 3 Expected dividends % pa 2.5 N A N A 2.5 Risk-free interest rate % pa 1.9 N A N A 1.9 Volatility of competitors % pa N A N A 29 to 62 N A Correlation with competitors % N A N A 40 N A Awards in 2010: 2 4 Fair value pence 100.5 254.0 172.4 257.7 5 Share price pence 250.00 254.0 254.7 & 257.7 Exercise price pence 204.00 0.00 0.00 1 Expected volatility % pa 51 N A 51 3 Expected dividends % pa 1.8 N A N A Risk-free interest rate % pa 2.0 N A N A Volatility of competitors % pa N A N A 17 to 106 Correlation with competitors % N A N A 20 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 107 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards continued 29.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Notes: 1 Expected volatility is based on an analysis of the Companys historic share price volatility over a period typically three or five years which is commensurate with the expected term of the options or the awards.
2 In 2009 and 2010, the vesting period for the SAYE plan was three years.
The vesting period may be extended by up to six months in order to catch up on missed contributions up to a maximum of six.
3 Dividends payable on the shares during the restricted period are paid out during the restricted period for the executive deferred bonus schemes and no dividend yield assumption is therefore required.
4 The awards made under the executive performance share plan are dependent upon earnings growth in the Company two-thirds of the award and a total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies one-third of the award.
This results in having two fair values for each of the awards made in the table above, the first being in relation to the comparator total shareholder return and the second relating to the Companys earnings growth.
5 Awards were made under the executive performance share plan on three and six separate occasions during 2009 and 2010 respectively.
6 There were no awards made in 2009 or 2010 for the executive share option schemes or the sales management share option schemes.
3183415 108 Financial Statements The SAYE plan options outstanding at 31 December 2010 had exercise prices of 150 pence 1,494,134 options, 204 pence 292,264 options and 213 pence 103,369 options and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.4 years.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Early exercise assumptions The following allowance has been made for the impact of early exercise once options have vested: 1 S AYE plan all option holders are assumed to exercise half-way through the six month exercise window.
2 Executive, sales management and partner share option schemes it is assumed that 10% of option holders are forced to exercise their options each year irrespective of the level of the share price.
For the remainder it is assumed that one-half will exercise their options each year if the share price is at least 33% above the exercise price.
Allowance for performance conditions The executive performance share plan includes a market based performance condition based on the Companys total shareholder return relative to an index of comparator companies.
The impact of this performance condition has been modelled using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, which involve running many thousands of simulations of future share price movements for both the Company and the comparator index.
For the purpose of these simulations it is assumed that the share price of the Company and the comparator index are 20% 2009: 40% correlated and that the comparator index has volatilities ranging between 17% pa and 106% pa 2009: 29% pa to 62% pa.
The performance condition is based on the Companys performance relative to the comparator index over a three year period commencing on 1 January each year.
The fair value calculations for the awards that were made in 2010 therefore include an allowance for the actual performance of the Companys share price relative to the index over the period between 1 January 2010 and the various award dates.
Charge to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income The table below sets out the charge to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of the share-based payment awards: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 million million Share-based payment expense 8.2 8.6 30.
