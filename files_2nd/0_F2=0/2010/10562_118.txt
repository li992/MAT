Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Notes to the Company balance sheet continued 40.
Contingent liabilities Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
There are no other contingent liabilities in the Company as at 2 January 2011.
The Group has been subject to legal claims in the USA, Canada and Europe.
Settlements for the majority of these have been agreed.
There remain provisions in respect of these claims of 1.4 million 2009: 0.7 million.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, either because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case and no provisions are held against such cases.
The Board, having taken legal advice, is of the opinion that the remainder of these actions will not have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
