The fair values of financial assets represent the market value of quoted investments and other traded instruments.
For non-listed investments and other non-traded financial assets, fair value is calculated with discounted cash flows using market assumptions, unless carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
Fair value hierarchy An analysis of financial assets carried at fair value is set out below: 2010 2009 1 2 3 1 2 3 US$ million level 1 level 2 level 3 total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At fair value through profit and loss Trade and other receivables 777 777 838 838 Other financial assets derivatives 801 41 842 3 569 31 603 Available for sale investments Financial asset investments 1,223 22 55 1,300 1,072 19 40 1,131 1,223 1,600 96 2,919 1,075 1,426 71 2,572 1 Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
This category includes listed equity shares, and certain exchange-traded derivatives.
2 Valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
Financial assets included within level 3 primarily consist of embedded derivatives and financial asset investments where valuation depends upon unobservable inputs.
There have been no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 in the year ended 31 December 2010.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial assets are shown in the following table: US$ million 2010 2009 At 1 January 71 137 Net loss recorded in remeasurements 6 111 Net gain recorded in statement of comprehensive income 10 1 Additions 3 Transfer to assets held for sale 26 Reclassification from to level 3 Other financial liabilities derivatives 41 35 Currency movements 3 9 At 31 December 96 71 For the level 3 financial assets, changing certain inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions may change the fair value significantly.
Where significant, the effect of a change in these assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative assumption is outlined in the table below.
These sensitivities have been calculated by amending the fair value of the level 3 financial assets at 31 December for a change in each individual assumption, as outlined below, whilst keeping all other assumptions consistent with those used to calculate the fair value recognised in the financial statements.
