Financials NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 01 General information SOCO International plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered ofce is given on page 94.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 6 and in the Review of Operations and Financial Review on pages 14 to 19 and 20 to 25, respectively.
02 Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with, and comply with, International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and on a going concern basis of accounting for the reasons set out in the Annual Report of the Directors on page 42 and in the Financial Review on page 20.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the valuation of hydrocarbon inventory and the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of each of the Companys subsidiary undertakings.
The functional currency of the Company remains GB pounds although its financial statements are presented in US dollars.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
b Adoption of new and revised accounting standards A number of new and revised IFRS and International Accounting Standards IAS have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Where we consider that their adoption may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements, they are set out below.
IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised 2008 Investments in Associates The above standards introduced a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations when acquiring a subsidiary or an associate.
IFRS 3 2008 has also introduced additional disclosure requirements relating to acquisitions.
A number of other new or revised standards are in issue but not yet effective.
However, none of these are expected to have any material impact on the Group when they are adopted in future periods.
c Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of SOCO International plc and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the balance sheet date.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method whereby the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and the consideration given are recognised in the Group accounts at their fair values as at the date of the acquisition.
d Investments Except as stated below, non-current investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Liquid investments comprise short term liquid investments of between three to six months maturity.
e Interests in joint ventures Jointly controlled entities are those for which the Group exercises joint control over the operating and financial policies.
These investments are dealt with by proportionate consolidation whereby the consolidated financial statements include the appropriate share of these companies assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line by line basis.
Where a consolidated member of the Group participates in unincorporated joint ventures, that member accounts directly for its share of the jointly controlled assets, liabilities and related income and expenses which are then similarly included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
f Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and no depreciation is charged.
SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 71 Financials NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 02 Significant accounting policies continued g Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of the Groups share of oil and gas sold during the year on an entitlement basis.
To the extent revenue arises from test production during an evaluation programme, an amount is charged from evaluation costs to cost of sales so as to reect a zero net margin.
Investment revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
h Tangible and intangible non-current assets Oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditure The Group uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration, evaluation and development expenditure, whereby all expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition, exploration, evaluation and development of oil and gas assets, including directly attributable overheads, interest payable and exchange differences directly related to nancing development projects, are capitalised in separate geographical cost pools.
Cost pools are established on the basis of geographical area having regard to the operational and financial organisation of the Group.
Intangible acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs incurred in a geographical area where the Group has no established cost pool are initially capitalised as intangible non-current assets except where they fall outside the scope of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources whereby they are expensed as incurred subject to other guidance under IFRS.
Tangible non-current assets used in acquisition, exploration and evaluation are classied with tangible non-current assets as property, plant and equipment.
To the extent that such tangible assets are consumed in exploration and evaluation the amount reecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Upon successful conclusion of the appraisal programme and determination that commercial reserves exist, such costs are transferred to tangible non-current assets as property, plant and equipment.
Exploration and evaluation costs carried forward are assessed for impairment as described below.
Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas assets are credited against the relevant cost centre.
Any overall surplus arising in a cost centre is credited to the income statement.
Depreciation and depletion Depletion is provided on oil and gas assets in production using the unit of production method, based on proven and probable reserves, applied to the sum of the total capitalised exploration, evaluation and development costs, together with estimated future development costs at current prices.
Oil and gas assets which have a similar economic life are aggregated for depreciation purposes.
Impairment of value Where there has been a change in economic conditions or in the expected use of a tangible non-current asset that indicates a possible impairment in an asset, management tests the recoverability of the net book value of the asset by comparison with the estimated discounted future net cash ows based on managements expectations of future oil prices and future costs.
Any identied impairment is charged to the income statement.
Intangible non-current assets are considered for impairment at least annually by reference to the indicators in IFRS 6.
Where there is an indication of impairment of an exploration and evaluation asset which is within a geographic pool where the Group has tangible oil and gas assets with commercial reserves, the exploration asset is assessed for impairment together with all other cash generating units and related tangible and intangible assets in that geographic pool and any balance remaining after impairment is amortised over the proven and probable reserves of the pool.
Where the exploration asset is in an area where the Group has no established pool, the exploration asset is tested for impairment separately and, where determined to be impaired, is written off.
Other tangible non-current assets Other tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost of those assets, less residual value, over their expected useful lives.
Decommissioning The decommissioning provision is calculated as the net present value of the Groups share of the expenditure which is expected to be incurred at the end of the producing life of each eld in the removal and decommissioning of the production, storage and transportation facilities currently in place.
The cost of recognising the decommissioning provision is included as part of the cost of the relevant property, plant and equipment and is thus charged to the income statement on a unit of production basis in accordance with the Groups policy for depletion and depreciation of tangible non-current assets.
Period charges for changes in the net present value of the decommissioning provision arising from discounting are included in finance costs.
i Changes in estimates The effects of changes in estimates on the unit of production calculations are accounted for prospectively over the estimated remaining proven and probable reserves of each pool.
SOCO International plc 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financials j Inventories Inventories, except for inventories of hydrocarbons, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Physical inventories of hydrocarbons, which are held for trading purposes, are valued at net realisable value and recorded as inventory.
Underlifts and overlifts are valued at market value and are included in prepayments and accrued income and accruals and deferred income, respectively.
Changes in hydrocarbon inventories, underlifts and overlifts are adjusted through cost of sales.
k Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
l Share-based payments Equity-settled awards under share-based incentive plans are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the performance period along with a corresponding increase in equity.
Fair value is measured using an option pricing model taking into consideration managements best estimate of the expected life of the option and the estimated number of shares that will eventually vest.
m Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to recover the asset.
Deferred tax is not recognised where an asset or liability is acquired in a transaction which is not a business combination for an amount which differs from its tax value.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
n Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group does not currently utilise derivative financial instruments.
Other than the convertible bonds there are no material financial assets and liabilities for which differences between carrying amounts and fair values are required to be disclosed.
The classication of financial instruments as required by IFRS 7 is disclosed in Notes 18, 21, 22 and 23.
Financial asset at fair value through profit or loss Where a financial instrument is classied as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss it is initially recognised at fair value.
At each balance sheet date the fair value is reviewed and any gain or loss arising is recognised in the income statement.
Period credits for changes in the net present value of the financial asset arising from discounting are included in other gains and losses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Convertible bonds The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity and is not remeasured.
The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 73 Financials NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 02 Significant accounting policies continued Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
o Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are stated in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date, or if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any resulting gains and losses are included in net profit or loss for the period.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements the results of entities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation at the closing rate of the opening net assets and results of entities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are dealt with through equity and transferred to the Groups retained earnings reserve.
p Pension costs The contributions payable in the year in respect of pension costs for dened contribution schemes and other post-retirement benets are charged to the income statement.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
03 Financial risk management The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing financial risks that may affect the Group.
In certain cases the Board delegates responsibility for such reviews and policy setting to the Audit Committee.
The main financial risks affecting the Group are discussed below: Credit risk The Groups non-current financial asset that is subject to credit risk comprises a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss arising in respect of the Groups disposal of its Mongolia interest see Note 18.
The Groups and Companys other financial assets comprise investments, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
The Group seeks to minimise credit risk by only maintaining balances with creditworthy third parties including major multinational oil companies subject to contractual terms in respect of trade receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited as the Board only selects institutions with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and endeavours to spread cash balances and liquid investments over more than one institution.
The level of deposits held by different institutions is regularly reviewed.
Foreign currency risk The Group primarily conducts and manages its business in US dollars.
Cash balances in Group subsidiaries are usually held in US dollars, but smaller amounts may be held in GB pounds or local currencies to meet immediate operating or administrative expenses, or to comply with local currency regulations.
However, during 2010 the Company placed new shares raising gross proceeds of 102.0 million see Note 25 and consequently held significant sterling cash balances as at 31 December 2010.
As these are held by the Company, which is a sterling functional currency entity, there is no foreign exchange transactional exposure.
Since the year end 2010 the Group has substantially reduced its sterling cash position.
From time to time the Group may take short term hedging positions to protect the value of any cash balances it holds in non-US dollar currencies.
The impact of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates on the Groups net assets as at 31 December 2010 would have been approximately $11.0 million 2009 not material and would not have been material with respect to the Groups profit in 2010 and 2009.
Liquidity risk The Groups cash requirements and balances are projected for the Group as a whole and for each country in which operations and capital expenditures are conducted.
The Group meets these requirements through an appropriate mix of available funds, equity instruments and debt nancing.
The Groups ability to satisfy its debt obligations and to pursue its operational objectives are discussed in the Risk Management section of the Financial Review.
The Group seeks to minimise the impact that any debt nancings have on its balance sheet by negotiating borrowings in matching currencies see Note 23.
The Group further mitigates liquidity risk by entering into arrangements with industry partners thereby sharing costs and risks, and by maintaining an insurance programme to minimise exposure to insurable losses.
SOCO International plc 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financials Interest rate risk The Group earns interest on its cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments at oating and xed rates.
Fixed rate interest is charged on the Groups convertible bonds see Note 23.
The fair value of the Groups non-current financial asset see Note 18 is also dependent on the discount rate used.
Management assess the Groups sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher or lower and all other variables held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended, and its net assets at, 31 December 2010 would decrease or increase by $2.7 million 2009 $2.6 million.
Commodity price risk The Groups production is usually sold on spot or near term contracts, with prices xed at the time of a transfer of custody or on the basis of a monthly average market price.
However the Board may give consideration in certain circumstances to the appropriateness of entering into xed price, long term marketing contracts.
Although oil prices may uctuate widely, it is the Groups policy not to hedge crude oil sales unless hedging is required to mitigate financial risks associated with debt nancing of its assets or to meet its commitments.
Over time, during periods when the Group sees an opportunity to lock in attractive oil prices, it may engage in limited price hedging.
Regulatory risk The Group operates in countries with emerging taxation and other regulatory regimes.
The compliance with and interpretation of these taxation and other regulations may expose the Group to risk.
The Group seeks to minimise such risk by using in country professional advisors and by engaging directly with the relevant authorities where appropriate.
Contractual risk The Group enters into various contractual arrangements in the ordinary course of its business.
Such contracts may rely on or include provisional information or contract terms that are subject to further negotiation at a later date.
This may give rise to uncertainty regarding such information and the related accounting treatment of the contracts.
In considering any financial impact on the Groups financial statements, income, expenses, assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with applicable IFRS and IAS.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt see Note 23, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 25 and 26 and in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
During the year the Company placed 28,937,388 new ordinary shares, post share sub-division, of 0.05 each see Note 25 and repaid convertible bonds with a par value of $165.9 million see Note 23.
04 Critical judgements and accounting estimates a Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies described in Note 2, management has made judgements that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
These are discussed below: Oil and gas assets Note 2 h describes the judgements necessary to implement the Groups policy with respect to the carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets and tangible property, plant and equipment.
Management considers these assets for impairment at least annually with reference to indicators in IFRS 6 and IAS 36, respectively.
In making its judgements in this area, management has concluded that capitalised expenditure relating to Block 16-1 in Vietnam is considered to be one cash generating unit due to the level of economic and management interdependence.
Note 15 discloses the carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets and Note 16 discloses the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
Further, Note 2 h describes the Groups policy regarding reclassication of intangible assets to tangible assets.
Management considers the appropriateness of asset classication at least annually.
Financial asset Note 2 n describes the accounting policy with respect to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The key judgements that are used in calculating the fair value of the Groups financial asset arising on the disposal of its Mongolia interest are described in Note 18 and are reviewed at least annually.
The only market risk assumption that has a significant impact on the fair value of this asset is the discount rate, as described in Note 3.
Convertible bonds Note 2 n sets out the Groups accounting policy on convertible bonds.
Management assesses the fair value of the liability component at issue and reviews the appropriateness of the amortisation period at least annually.
Note 2 h describes the nature of the costs that the Group capitalises which include applicable borrowing costs that are directly attributable to qualifying assets as dened in IAS 23 Borrowing Costs IAS 23.
Management has considered the denition of qualifying assets in IAS 23 and has determined that the only expenditure that currently meets the denition is that related to the Groups interests in Vietnam.
Consequently, the interest associated with capital expenditure in Vietnam has been capitalised up to the date at which such qualifying assets enter into production.
SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 75 Financials NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 04 Critical judgements and accounting estimates continued b Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, other than those mentioned above, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below: Oil and gas reserves Note 2 h sets out the Groups accounting policy on depreciation and depletion.
Proven and probable reserves are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques.
The estimate is reviewed at least twice a year and is regularly reviewed by independent consultants.
Future development costs are estimated taking into account the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Decommissioning provision The accounting policy for decommissioning is discussed in Note 2 h. The cost of decommissioning is estimated by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Further details are provided in Note 24.

The 2009 gures have been restated accordingly.
The tax charge in future periods may also be affected by the factors in the reconciliation.
12 Discontinued operations In July 2010, SOCO announced that it had entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement, with an effective date of 1 January 2010, for the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary SOCO Thailand LLC SOCO Thailand to Salamander Energy plc for an initial value of $105.0 million subject to certain financial adjustments including adjustments in respect of cash ows arising from the effective date, plus contingent cash consideration of $1 million the Disposal.
SOCO Thailand was the 99.9993% shareholder of SOCO Exploration Thailand Co Limited, the entity that held the Groups interest in the Bualuang Field, offshore of Thailand and which was a component of the Groups South East Asia segment see Note 6.
The Disposal completed in September 2010.
The results of the Groups discontinued Thailand interest are shown on the consolidated income statement and in Note 6.
Net operating cash ows from discontinued operations are shown in Note 28.
During the period to the date of completion of the Disposal cash used in investing activities was $11.2 million and cash from nancing activities was $2.3 million.
Immediately prior to the completion of the Disposal the Groups share of net assets associated with the Thailand interest was $28.5 million comprising property, plant and equipment of $28.5 million, current assets of $41.0 million including amounts owed by Group undertakings of $6.4 million, current liabilities of $29.2 million and long term liabilities of $11.8 million.
Upon completion the Group recognised a gain, excluding contingent consideration, of $80.1 million and cash inow of $85.9 million reecting the $105.0 million cash consideration less the Groups share of cash held by the Thailand interest of $16.3 million, transaction costs of $1.8 million and financial adjustments of $1.0 million.

The Group funds 100% of SOCO Congo and is entitled to receive 100% of the distributions made by SOCO Congo until it has recovered such funding including a rate of return.
The 15% non-controlling interest is held by Quantic Limited.
2 SOCO DRC Limited SOCO DRC owns 99% of SOCO Exploration and Production DRC Sprl which holds the Groups working interest in its DRC asset.
The Group funds 100% of SOCO DRC and is entitled to receive 100% of the distributions made by SOCO DRC until it has recovered such funding including a rate of return.
3 The remaining 20% non-controlling interest is funded by the Group.
The Group is entitled to receive 100% of the distributions made by SOCO Vietnam until it has recovered its funding of the non-controlling interest including a rate of return on the non-controlling interests pro rata portion of those distributions.
The Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings include contributions to the SOCO Employee benefit Trust see Note 26 and are otherwise held in the form of share capital.
18 Financial asset In 2005, the Group completed a transaction whereby it sold its 100% owned subsidiaries SOCO Tamtsag Mongolia, LLC SOTAMO and SOCO Mongolia Ltd SOCO Mongolia to Daqing Oileld Limited Company Daqing.
Together SOTAMO and SOCO Mongolia held the Groups Mongolia interest.
Under the terms of the transaction the Group will receive total consideration of up to $92.3 million comprising $39.6 million of cash consideration net of settlement adjustments, plus a subsequent payment amount.
The remaining consideration is payable, once cumulative production reaches 27.8 million barrels of oil, at the rate of 20% of the average monthly posted marker price for Daqing crude multiplied by the aggregate production for that month, up to a total of $52.7 million.
The subsequent payment amount is included in non-current assets as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.
The timescale for the production of crude oil in excess of 27.8 million barrels and the price of Daqing marker crude oil are factors that cannot accurately be predicted.
However, based upon the Directors current estimates of proven and probable reserves from the Mongolia interests and the development scenarios as discussed with the buyer, the Directors believe that the full subsequent payment amount will be payable.
The fair value of the subsequent payment amount was determined using a valuation technique as there is no active market against which direct comparisons can be made Level 3 as dened in IFRS 7.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair value include the factors mentioned above, risked as appropriate, with the resultant cash ows discounted at a commercial risk free interest rate.
The fair value of the financial asset at the date of completion of the sale was $31.5 million.
As at 31 December 2010 the fair value was $37.4 million 2009 $36.2 million after accounting for the change in fair value see Note 7.
