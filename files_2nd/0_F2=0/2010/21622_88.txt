The differences are explained below: 2010 2009 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Return on ordinary activities before taxation 12,798 533,418 546,216 9,157 588,421 597,578 Return on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax 28% 2009: 28% 3,583 149,357 152,940 2,564 164,758 167,322 Effects of: Non taxable UK dividends 1,614 1,614 1,131 1,131 Non taxable overseas dividends 4,204 4,204 1,340 1,340 Withholding tax suffered 1,059 1,059 551 551 Overseas tax taken as allowable deduction 93 93 Gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss 149,357 149,357 164,758 164,758 Prior year tax adjustment 72 72 66 66 Increase in excess management expenses and finance charges 2,235 2,235 1,131 1,131 485 485 Deferred tax 4,063 4,063 42 42 Current taxation charge for the year note 7 a 1,131 4,063 5,194 443 443 At 31 December 2010 the Company had net excess management expenses of 8.8 million 2009: 400,000.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in the future in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing excess expenses.
There was an unrecognised deferred tax asset therefore of 2.4 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 100,000.
However a deferred tax liability has been provided for in the capital column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
This is in relation to anticipated Peruvian capital gains tax on disposal of the investments in Peru.
The UK excess management expenses cannot be used to offset this liability.
Investment trusts are exempt from corporation tax on capital gains provided the Company obtains agreement from HM Revenue & Customs that section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 tests have been met.
