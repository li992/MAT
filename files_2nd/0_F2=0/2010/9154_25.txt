Tax on exceptional items for the year is a charge of 7m, all of which relates to current year items.
In 2008 09 tax on exceptional items was a credit of 7m, all of which related to current year items.
The effective tax rate calculation is set out in the Financial review on page 22.
In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of 55m has been credited directly to equity 2008 09: 35m credit, of which a 12m credit 2008 09: 2m charge is included in current tax and a 43m credit 2008 09: 37m credit is included in deferred tax.
King sher paid 138m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this as an exceptional tax charge.
King sher appealed against this tax liability and the tribunal found in favour of King sher in June 2009.
As a result, on 7 September 2009 the Group received 169m 148m from the French tax authorities, representing a refund of the 138m and 31m of repayment supplement.
The French tax authorities have appealed against this decision and therefore no income has been recognised in these financial statements.

The groups of CGUs for which the carrying amount of goodwill is deemed signi cant are the UK and France.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are set out below: Assumptions The cash ow projections are based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by the Board covering a five year period.
These are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development.
Key drivers in the plans are like-for-like LFL sales, margin and operating pro t percentage.
LFL sales are based on the Groups market expectations and the CGUs market shares.
Cash ows beyond this five year period are calculated using a growth rate of 1.9% 2008 09: 1.9% which does not exceed the long term average growth rate for retail businesses operating in the same countries as the CGUs.
Working capital movements are included in the model, building in anticipated movements due to the level of trading and including reductions across the Group as part of the Delivering Value programme over the first three years.
The weighted average cost of capital, used to discount future cash ows, is calculated using a combination of the cost of debt and the cost of equity balanced according to the Groups level of financial gearing.
A risk adjustment is then made for the country in which the CGU operates.
United Kingdom The risk-adjusted discount rate of 11.3% 2008 09: 12.0% is pre-tax and re ects the speci c risks inherent in the UK market.
A decrease in cash ows of 33% would result in the value-in-use of goodwill being equal to its carrying amount.
The Board do not consider that a reasonably possible change would lead to the recoverable amount being below the carrying amount of goodwill based on this level of headroom.
France The risk-adjusted discount rate of 11.6% 2008 09: 13.4% is pre-tax and re ects the speci c risks inherent in the French market.
A decrease in cash ows of 55% would result in the value-in-use of goodwill being equal to its carrying amount.
Poland The risk-adjusted discount rate of 13.2% 2008 09: 13.7% is pre-tax and re ects the speci c risks inherent in the Polish market.
A decrease in cash ows of 78% would result in the value-in-use of goodwill being equal to its carrying amount.
China In the prior year, the goodwill relating to the China business was fully impaired.
This arose due to a weak housing market following a rapid property market slowdown, the dependence of the business on new apartment t outs and increasing local competition.

The carrying amounts of the MTNs and USPP have been impacted both by exchange rate movements and fair value adjustments for interest rate risk.
At 30 January 2010, the cumulative effect of interest rate fair value adjustments is to increase the Groups Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt by 70m 2008 09: 106m.
The USPP contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each semi-annual and annual financial reporting period, the ratio of operating pro t to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month period.
The Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 30 January 2010.
Finance leases The Group leases certain of its buildings and xtures and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term maturity for buildings is seven years 2008 09: seven years and for xtures and equipment is two years 2008 09: two years.
Certain building leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases, together with the present value of minimum lease payments, are as follows: 2009 10 2008 09 Present Present value of Minimum value of Minimum millions payments payments payments payments Less than one year 12 16 13 18 One to five years 27 36 23 37 More than five years 26 43 33 51 Total 65 95 69 106 Less amounts representing finance charges 30 37 Present value of minimum lease payments 65 69 The interest rates inherent in the finance leases are xed at the contract date for the lease term.
The weighted average effective interest rate on the Groups finance leases is 8.2% 2008 09: 8.4%.
Fair value of borrowings The fair values of current borrowings approximate to their carrying amounts.
Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair values of non-current borrowings.
Where market values are not available or are not reliable, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and foreign exchange rates.
The carrying amounts and fair values of non-current borrowings are as follows: 2009 10 2008 09 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair millions amount value amount value Bank loans 18 17 94 98 Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt 812 820 1,757 1,521 Finance leases 53 75 56 70 883 912 1,907 1,689 Assets worth RMB 1 billion 91m secure a bank facility in China, which matures in July 2010.

These fair value measurements are all made using observable market rates of interest, foreign exchange and credit risk and are therefore classi ed as level 2 in the IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, fair value hierarchy.
At 30 January 2010 net derivative assets included in net debt amount to 20m 2008 09: 135m.
Fair value hedges Interest rate swap contracts convert xed rate debt issued under the Groups MTN programme and the US Private Placement to oating rate liabilities.
At 30 January 2010 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 984m 2008 09: 1,391m.
307m of a 550m interest rate swap and 65m of a 150m interest rate swap have been cancelled in the year.
Cash ow hedges Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases.
At 30 January 2010 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 264m 2008 09: 181m.
The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases occur during the next 12 months.
Gains of 5m 2008 09: 10m gains have been transferred to inventories for contracts which matured during the year.
Swap contracts to hedge the cost of diesel oil for use in the business were entered into during the prior year.
At 30 January 2010 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is nil 2008 09: 4m.
Net investment hedges Cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge currency exposures of overseas investments.
At 30 January 2010 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 138m 2008 09: 373m.
Non-designated hedges The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge against uctuations in the income statement arising from balance sheet positions.
At 30 January 2010 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 1,100m 2008 09: 830m.
These have not been accounted for as hedges, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation of the balance sheet positions.
These include a cross-currrency swap, an interest rate swap and short term foreign exchange contracts.
A 330m cross-currency swap has matured in the year.
The Group has reviewed all signi cant contracts for embedded derivatives and none of these contracts has any embedded derivatives which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore the Group is not required to account for these separately.

The Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments required to manage these risks.
King shers treasury function is not run as a pro t centre and does not enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
In the normal course of business the Group uses financial instruments including derivatives.
The main types of financial instruments used are Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt, bank loans and deposits, money market funds, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk Borrowings arranged at oating rates of interest expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at xed rates of interest expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Groups underlying debt instruments, principally the Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt.
Currency risk The Groups principal currency exposures are to the Euro, US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Chinese Renminbi.
The Euro, Polish Zloty and Chinese Renminbi exposures are operational and arise through the ownership of retail businesses in France, Spain, Ireland, Poland and China.
Balance sheet Euro translation exposure is substantially hedged by maintaining a proportion of the Groups debt in Euro, whilst Chinese Renminbi balance sheet translation exposure is partly hedged by local debt in China.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings primarily Euro into Sterling.
In addition, the Group has signi cant transaction exposure arising on the purchase of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Under Group policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed inventory purchases and a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months, and this is monitored on an ongoing basis.
King shers policy is to manage the interest rate and currency pro le of its issued debt using derivative contracts.
The effect of these contracts on the Groups net debt is as follows: Sterling Euro US Dollar Other millions Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Total At 30 January 2010 Net debt before fair value adjustments and nancing derivatives 371 357 541 536 289 32 57 19 200 Fair value adjustments to net debt 22 11 37 70 Financing derivatives 353 1,249 394 31 327 129 97 20 Net debt 40 892 158 505 1 161 57 116 250 At 31 January 2009 Net debt before fair value adjustments and nancing derivatives 438 313 977 472 321 42 137 13 1,033 Fair value adjustments to net debt 7 42 57 106 Financing derivatives 400 1,053 667 469 324 121 145 135 Net debt 38 747 310 39 3 106 137 158 1,004 Financial instruments principally affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the signi cant market risks impacting King sher, are borrowings, deposits and derivatives.

The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until the purchases occur.
See note 23 for further details.
The retranslation of foreign currency borrowings and derivatives designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations is reported in equity, but offset by the retranslation of the hedged net investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are before the effect of tax.
It has been prepared on the basis that the Groups debt, hedging activities, hedge accounting designations, and foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts remain constant, re ecting the positions at 30 January 2010 and 31 January 2009 respectively.
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
In preparing the sensitivity analysis it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective.
The effects shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Liquidity risk The Group regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities required to fund its activities.
This involves preparing a prudent cash ow forecast for the next three years, determining the level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning for repayments of debt at its maturity and identifying an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected out ows.
The following table analyses the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
It excludes trade and other payables due to the low associated liquidity risk.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows and as such may differ from the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.
275m of bilateral facilities were cancelled in the year.
The 500m facility contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each annual financial reporting period, the ratio of operating pro t to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month period.
indd 84 13 4 10 13 4 10 02:23:16 02:23:16 King sher plc Annual Report and Accounts 85 2009 10 Credit risk The Group deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with strong credit ratings and with money market funds which have the strongest, AAA, credit rating.
A credit limit for each counterparty is agreed by the Board covering the full value of deposits and a proportion of the value of derivative contracts.
The credit risk is reduced further by spreading the investments and derivative contracts across several counterparties.
At 30 January 2010, the highest cash deposit with a single counterparty was 101m 2008 09: 89m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash at bank and short term deposits and the fair value of derivative assets.
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts as the Group has a low concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables.
Concentration of risk is limited as a result of low individual balances with short maturity spread across a large number of unrelated customers.
At 30 January 2010, trade and other receivables that are past due but not provided against amount to 29m 2008 09: 20m, of which 4m 2008 09: 1m are over 120 days past due.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 7m 2008 09: 14m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 309m 2008 09: 214m due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China of 245m 2008 09: 170m which can only be carried forward in the next one to five years and tax losses arising in Spain of 27m 2008 09: 36m which can only be carried forward for up to 15 years.
Other losses may be carried forward inde nitely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Earnings which could be remitted on which there would be tax to pay total 91m 2008 09: 193m.

The provisions are based on the present value of future cash out ows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
Restructuring provisions include the estimated costs of the UK and China restructuring programmes.
The provisions have been discounted to re ect the time value of money and the risks associated with the speci c liabilities.
The ultimate costs and timing of cash ows related to the above provisions are largely dependent on exiting the property lease contracts and subletting surplus space.

Various fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes are operated in France and Poland, where they are retirement indemnity in nature, and in China.
The overseas schemes are not material in relation to the Group as a whole.

The UK scheme was closed to new entrants in 2004.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the scheme Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2007.
The Company monitors the scheme funding level on a regular basis and will review with the scheme Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule currently in place.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups fide ned bene t pension schemes are set by the directors after consultation with independent professionally quali ed actuaries.
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to signi cant movements in the estimated obligations, as illustrated in the sensitivity analysis.
The UK scheme discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets re ects market expectations at the valuation date of long term asset returns and the mix of assets in the schemes.
indd 88 13 4 10 13 4 10 02:23:18 02:23:18 King sher plc Annual Report and Accounts 89 2009 10 For the UK scheme, the mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics and experience of the membership of the scheme from 2004 to 2007.
The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables PA 92 tables projected forward to 2007 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the standard improvements, subject to a minimum of 0.5% pa.
These improvements have been set with regard to trends observed within the scheme over the past decade.
The assumptions for life expectancy of UK scheme members are as follows: Years 2009 10 2008 09 Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 87.2 87.2 Female 85.9 85.9 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 88.8 88.8 Female 87.1 87.1 The following sensitivity analysis for the UK scheme shows the estimated impact on obligations resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
