API American Petroleum Institute gravity bbl Barrels of oil bpd Barrels per day C Category C2 reserves are preliminary estimated reserves of a deposit calculated on the basis of geological 2 and geophysical research of unexplored sections of deposits adjoining sections of a field containing reserves of higher categories and of untested deposits of explored fields.
Category C2 reserves are used to determine the development potential of a field and to plan geological, exploration and production activities.
C3 Category C3 resources are prospective reserves prepared for the drilling of i traps within the oil-andgas bearing area, delineated by geological and geophysical exploration methods tested for such area and ii the formation of explored fields which have not yet been exposed by drilling.
The form, size and stratification conditions of the assumed deposit are estimated from the results of geological and geophysical research.
The thickness, reservoir characteristics of the formations, the composition and the characteristics of hydrocarbons are assumed to be analogous to those for explored fields.
Category C3 resources are used in the planning of prospecting and exploration work in areas known to contain other reserve bearing fields.
D1 Category D1 resources are calculated based on the results the regions geological, geophysical and geochemical research and by analogy with explored fields within the region being evaluated.
Category D1 resources are reserves in lithological and stratigraphic series that are evaluated within the boundaries of large regional structures confirmed to contain commercial reserves of oil and natural gas.
