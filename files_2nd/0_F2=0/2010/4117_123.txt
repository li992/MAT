New standards and interpretations applied the following accounting standards and interpretations became effective for the current reporting period: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS iFRs 2 share-based Payments: vesting Conditions and Cancellations Amendments iFRs 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures Amendments iFRs 8 operating segments iAs 1 Presentation of Financial statements Revised iAs 23 Borrowing Costs Revised isA 27 Consolidated and separate Financial statements Amendments iAs 32 Financial instruments: Presentation and iAs 1 Puttable Financial instruments and obligations arising on Liquidation Amendment improvements to iFRss may 2008 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC iFRiC 9 Remeasurement of embedded Derivatives and iAs 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement iFRiC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes iFRiC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real estate iFRiC 16 hedges of a net investment in a Foreign operation iFRiC 18 transfer of Assets from Customers the application of iAs 1 Revised Presentation of Financial statements has resulted in the Group presenting both a Group statement of comprehensive income which replaces the Group statement of recognised income and expense and a Group statement of changes in equity which replaces the Group reconciliation of movements in equity as primary statements.
the Group statement of changes in equity presents all changes in equity, and the Group statement of comprehensive income presents all changes in financial position other than through transactions with owners.
this presentation has been applied in these financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2010.
Comparative information has also been presented so that it is also in conformity with the revised standard.
iFRs 8 operating segments replaces iAs 14, segment Reporting and requires the disclosure of segment information on the same basis as the management information provided to the chief operating decision maker.
the adoption of this standard has not resulted in a change in the Groups reportable segments.
the application of the remaining standards and interpretations has not had a material effect on the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group.
New standards and interpretations not applied the iAsB and iFRiC have issued a number of new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
the Directors do not consider that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups and Companys financial statements in the period of initial application.
the standards not applied are as follows: PAGe 62 | CRANSWICK plc RePoRt & ACCoUnts 2010 International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date iFRs 1 First time Adoption of international Reporting standards 1 July 2009 iFRs 1 Amendments to iFRs 1 Additional exemptions for First-time Adopters 1 January 2010 iFRs 1 Amendments to iFRs 1 Limited exemption from Comparative iFRs 7 disclosures 1 July 2010 iFRs 2 Amendments to iFRs 2 Group Cash-settled share-based Payment transactions 1 January 2010 iFRs 3 Business Combinations Revised January 2008 1 July 2009 iFRs 9 Financial instruments: Classification & measurement 1 January 2013 iAs 24 Related Party Disclosures Revised 1 January 2011 iAs 27 Consolidated and separate Financial statements Revised January 2008 1 July 2009 iAs 32 Amendment to iAs 32: Classification of Rights issues 1 February 2010 iAs 39 eligible hedged items 1 July 2009 improvements to iFRs issued April 2009 various dates International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC Effective date iFRiC 14 Amendment: Prepayments of a minimum Funding Requirement 1 January 2011 iFRiC 17 Distributions of non-Cash Assets to owners 1 July 2009 iFRiC 19 extinguishing Financial Liabilities with equity instruments 1 July 2010 the effective dates stated above are those given in the original iAsB iFRiC standards and interpretations.
As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with iFRs as adopted by the european Union, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the eU via the eU endorsement mechanism.
in the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Groups discretion to early adopt standards.
the Group has not early adopted the revised iFRs 3 and so will apply it prospectively to all business combinations on or after 1 April 2010.
Whilst it is not possible to estimate the outcome of adoption, the key features of the revised iFRs 3 include a requirement for acquisition-related costs to be expensed and not included in the purchase price: and for contingent consideration to be recognised at fair value on the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised in the income statement and not as a change to goodwill.
the standard also changes the treatment of minority interests with an option to recognise these at full fair value as at the acquisition date and a requirement for previously held minority interests to be fair valued as at the date control is obtained, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
iAs 27 revised is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, in line with the revised iFRs 3. the revised standard no longer restricts the allocation to minority interest of losses incurred by a subsidiary to the amount of the minority equity investment in the subsidiary.
Any future partial disposal of equity interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control will be accounted for as an equity transaction and will have no impact on goodwill, nor will it give rise to any gain or loss.
Where there is loss of control of a subsidiary, any retained interest will have to be remeasured to fair value, which will impact the gain or loss recognised on disposal.
the Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
