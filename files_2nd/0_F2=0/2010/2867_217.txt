Profit before interest and taxation The profit before interest and taxation is based on the assumption that future margins will remain at the levels currently being achieved.
Discount rate The discount rate reflects managements estimate of the gross cost of capital employed for the groups of CGUs listed above.
This is the benchmark established to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
The rate applied to all CGUs is the same across all units, this reflects the Groups funding arrangements where all units have equal access to the Groups treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations.
None of the Groups CGUs demonstrates levels of risk that are significantly different to that experienced by the Group generally and all have similar funding profiles and therefore the discount rate applied is deemed to be justified.
Rates of growth in cash-generating units beyond the budget period years 2 to 5 Growth rate assumptions are based on, as far as possible, published industry research IDC 2010.
Where the cash-generating unit does not correspond directly with the research undertaken then the growth rate used is that of the nearest possible match in relation to the risks experienced within the associated market.
The rates used are further crosschecked with the senior operational management of the units in question.
