Unlisted invetsments are stated at the General Partners valuation.
The General Partners policy in valuing unlisted investments is to carry them at fair value.
The General Partner will generally rely on the fund investment managers fair value at the last reported period rolled forward for any cash flows.
However if the General Partner does not feel the manager is reflecting a fair value they will select a valuation methodology that is most appropriate for the particular investments in that fund and generate a fair value.
In those circumstances the General Partner believes the most appropriate methodologies to use to value the underlying investments in the portfolio are: Price of a recent investment Multiples Net assets Industry valuation benchmarks The Directors consider any valuations of level 3 investments based on reasonably alternative assumptions to be immaterial to the results of the Company and the Group.
25 Share Based Payments The Group operates two share based payment schemes.
All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP AESOP performance targets are set annually and dependent upon their achievement all employees may receive up to 3,000 of shares: this amount is pro rated for part time employees.

Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved by the Companys shareholders at its Annual General Meeting on 24 May 2007 and replaces the Senior Management Equity Incentive Plan SMEIP.
Like the SMEIP, it is a discretionary plan for executive Directors and senior managers.
The LTIP comprises two elements: first it provides for the grant of matching awards based on the proportion of annual bonus applied by participants in the purchase of shares in the Company and held by the Employee Benefit Trust: and secondly it provides for the grant of performance awards.
Both awards, granted over shares in the Company, vest either in full or in part at the end of the three year performance period subject to meeting pre-defined targets.
In the year to 31 January 2010 participating employees applied a proportion of their annual cash bonuses for the year ended 31 January 2009 to purchase 288,730 197,247 Company shares at a price of 2.84 3.42 per share.
Matching awards of up to 527,449 376,672 shares, and performance awards of up to 650,544 958,560 were granted.
Matching awards and performance awards made during the year were valued at 901,000 444,000 and 1,110,000 1,048,000 respectively.
The fair value of the awards granted during the period was calculated using a binomial methodology.
The assumptions used were a share price of 2.83 3.51, share price volatility of 33.7% 12.8% based on 3 year volatility to 9 June 2009, dividend yield of 2.8% 2.2%, risk free interest rate of 3.77% 4.25%, and forfeiture of nil nil.
In respect of awards made under the schemes for 2007 and 2008 the target to achieve the minimum level of vesting was to achieve a TSR Total Shareholder Return equivalent to inflation RPI plus 3% each year compounded over 3 years.
In repect of the 2009 scheme the target as approved by shareholders was to achieve performance above the median of our peer group.
The cumulative charge to the income statement during the year for the cost of the SMEIP and LTIP awards referred to above was 893,000 389,000 for the Company and 878,000 742,000 for the Group.
Per IFRS 2 the costs of matching awards for each plan are expensed over the three year performance period.
