The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 17m 2009: 14m, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.

a Share option schemes i Executive share option scheme In May 1995, the Group adopted the 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme which was made available to Directors and other senior employees.
The scheme was terminated on 25 May 2005.
The scheme offered options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the grant which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The maximum exercise value of the ordinary shares subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and 100,000.
The exercise of options under the scheme is subject to performance criteria broadly requiring an increase in Group operating profits of at least 20% between the year prior to the date of the grant and its third or any succeeding anniversary.
Those options which have been granted after 7 November 2002 have been fair valued using a binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The fair value of options granted and the assumptions were as follows: Grant date 12 Nov 2004 02 Apr 2003 Share price at grant date 2.33 1.81 Fair value of options granted 1.4m 1.9m Exercise price 2.22 1.75 Dividend yield 1.43% 1.49% Annual risk free interest rate 4.61% 4.12% Expected volatility 29.4% 29.4% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the last six years prior to the date of grant.
