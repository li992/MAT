The effective tax rate for the period is above the UK corporation tax rate of 28% due to non tax deductible impairment on investment assets and goodwill, other disallowable expenditure, and a reduction in the deferred tax asset due to a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate.
These effects are offset by the inclusion of the share of profit of associates in the Consolidated Income Statement on an after tax basis in accordance with IAS 1 and by the net lower tax rates applied to profit arising outside the UK.
