A defined benefit scheme is an arrangement where an employees retirement receipts are defined by factors such as salary, length of service and age.
The liabilities of the groups one defined benefit scheme, which was closed to new entrants in 1996, are measured using the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate that reflects the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds with a term that matches that of the liabilities.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and the exercise of judgement in the process of applying the groups accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are kept under continuous evaluation and are based mainly on historical experience and expectations of future events but incorporate other factors.
The critical estimates and judgements made in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
The actual outcome may be materially different from that anticipated.
Impairment of loans and advances Allowances for loan impairment represent managements estimate of the losses incurred in the loan portfolios as at the balance sheet date.
Changes to the allowances for loan impairment are reported in the consolidated income statement as impairment losses on loans and advances.
Impairment provisions are made if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more subsequent events regarding a significant loan or a portfolio of loans a loan and its impact can be reliably estimated.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
All impairment losses are reviewed at least at each reporting date.
If subsequently the amount of the loss decreases as a result of a new event, the relevant element of the outstanding impairment loss is reversed.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the original effective interest rate applied to the carrying amount as reduced by an allowance for impairment.
For loans that are not considered individually significant, the group adopts a formulaic approach which allocates a loss rate dependent on the overdue period.
Loss rates are based on the discounted expected future cash flows and are regularly benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they remain appropriate.
Fair value of financial instruments Some of the groups financial instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss such as those held for trading, designated by management under the fair value option and non-cash flow hedging derivatives.
Other non-derivative financial assets may be designated as available for sale.
Available for sale financial assets are carried at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included as a separate component of equity.
In addition, the group has cash flow hedging derivatives which are carried at fair value.
The fair value gain or loss associated with the effective proportion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially directly in equity.
