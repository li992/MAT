b Los Pelambres produces copper and molybdenum concentrates, and the gures for Los Pelambres are expressed in terms of payable metal contained in concentrate.
The copper concentratealso contains gold and silver, for which Los Pelambres is credited when the concentrate is sold.
El Tesoro and Michilla produce copper cathodes with no by-products.
c Cash costs are a measure of the cost of operational production expressed in terms of cents per pound of payable copper produced.
Cash costs are stated net of by-product credits and includetolling charges for concentrate for Los Pelambres.
Cash costs exclude depreciation, financial income and expenses, hedging gains and losses, exchange gains and losses and corporation tax for all three operations.
By-product calculations do not take into account unrealised mark-to-market gains for molybdenum at the beginning or end of each period.
