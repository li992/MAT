It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
The Group Treasury Committee GTC oversees the operation of Group Treasury in accordance with terms of reference set out by the Board.
The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions.
The GTC currently comprises the Finance Director: Director of Accounting, Forecasting and Tax: Director of Investor Communications: Cigar Business Unit Finance Director: Senior Group Management Accountant Manufacturing and Group Treasurer.
The GTC agrees a framework which sets out the current expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities, covering all key areas within Group Treasury.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including the provision of a monthly treasury report, which is also provided to the GTC.
123 Strategy Performance Governance Financials Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Borrowings and Derivative Financial Instruments continued Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies, foreign currency cash deposits, borrowings and non-sterling derivatives.
In 2010, 82 per cent of revenue 2009: 82 per cent and 80 per cent of adjusted profit from operations 2009: 80 per cent was in markets outside the UK.
Certain sales in these markets are invoiced in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling company.
Material costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of subsidiaries include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
After taking into account other US dollar inflows the Group currently does not consider this foreign exchange cash flow risk to be material enough to hedge.
The Group has a policy of managing its balance sheet translation risk by funding acquisitions and the underlying business assets with borrowings post cross currency swaps in the currency of the underlying net assets.
This also results in foreign currency profits from operations being partially offset by foreign currency interest costs thereby minimising the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and has a policy of using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and foreign exchange swaps where necessary, to change the debt into the desired currency.
At 30 September 2010, approximately 27 per cent 2009: 13 per cent of adjusted net debt was denominated in sterling, 50 per cent in euro 2009: 56 per cent and 23 per cent in US dollars 2009: 31 per cent.
The Groups sterling dividend to shareholders is partly sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings.
In order to manage the foreign exchange cash flow risk, and to provide greater certainty as to the amount of sterling available to pay expected future dividends, the Group has entered into transactional cross currency swaps maturing between 2011 and 2015 that will convert expected euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals, the fair value of derivative financial instruments providing commercial cash flow hedges and finance lease liabilities.
The Groups financial results are currently principally exposed to gains or losses arising from fluctuations in sterling, euro and US dollar interest rates.
In order to manage the interest rate risk on its borrowings, the Group separates its borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and uses derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps where necessary, to change the debt into floating interest rates shortly after issue.
The Group then transacts interest rate swaps at other times for different notional amounts and for different maturities to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
At 30 September 2010, 29 per cent 2009: 32 per cent of adjusted net debt was at a floating rate of interest, 70 per cent 2009: 67 per cent at a fixed rate of interest and one per cent 2009: one per cent floating within a set range.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure on a regular basis and reports the position monthly to the Board and GTC.
This report shows the profit or loss impact of a defined interest rate shift for each of the major currencies of borrowings and the forecast percentage of debt fixed for at least the next ten years.
The Group has no material interest rate repricing risk since the interest rates of derivative financial instruments reset quarterly, resulting in the interest being paid or received approximating current market rates.
124 Sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income due to hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates in relation to all of the Groups financial instruments.
The Group considers that the movements in interest rates and sterling foreign exchange rates shown in the table below represent reasonably possible changes.
The impacts on income and other comprehensive income of these changes are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September 2010.
The sensitivity analysis does not reflect any change to revenue or non-finance costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
All financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of subsidiary companies are excluded from the analysis.
The analysis also excludes instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
30 September 2010 30 September 2009 Other Other comprehensive comprehensive Income income Income income million loss gain loss gain loss gain loss gain 100 basis point increase 50 basis point decrease in GBP interest rates 14 7 9 5 100 basis point increase decrease in euro interest rates 9 9 12 12 100 basis point increase 25 basis point decrease in US dollar interest rates 7 2 16 4 10% appreciation depreciation of the euro 82 67 1,054 863 156 128 1,097 898 10% appreciation depreciation of the US dollar 5 4 194 159 222 181 56 46 The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reflects the effect on net finance costs in respect of the Groups floating rate debt at 30 September 2010.
The impact in the income statement from foreign exchange rate movements primarily relates to financial instruments that commercially hedge net investments, but are not accounted for as hedges under IAS 39 although they are commercially effective.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the commercially hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net impact on shareholders funds of zero.
Any gain or loss which arises is excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
The other comprehensive income impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value will be more than fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its trade receivables due from customers, as well as from cash and cash deposits and the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments transacted with financial institutions.
The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support to reduce the risk where this is considered to be necessary.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 13.
The Group has a policy of having no concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions that are in excess of limits agreed by the Board.
The Group has placed cash deposits and entered into derivative financial instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to manage its credit risk to any one financial institution.

Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, which represents having insufficient funds to meet the financing needs of the Group.
To manage this risk the Group has a policy of actively maintaining a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
At 30 September 2010 the Group had 1,798 million 2009: 3,109 million of undrawn committed facilities, maturing in July 2012.
As well as forecasting and monitoring the Groups core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, loans from central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by subsidiary companies are remitted to Group Treasury where practical and possible and are used to pay down debt whenever possible.
The table below summarises the Groups financial liabilities by maturity based on their contractual cash flows.
The contractual cash flows disclosed in the table are undiscounted and have been calculated using spot rates at the relevant balance sheet date, including interest to be paid.
The balance sheet amounts disclosed in the table for derivative financial liabilities include collateral of 243 million 2009: 356 million which has been transferred to counterparties in respect of certain derivatives with a negative fair value.
The future cash inflows arising from collateral transferred have not been allocated to time periods since there is no reasonable basis upon which to do so.

The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries and counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
Capital risk management The Group manages the capital structure in an efficient manner in order to minimise the cost of capital whilst ensuring that we have access to ongoing sources of finance such as the debt capital markets.
The Group defines capital as adjusted net debt see note 26 and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company see Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The only externally imposed capital requirements for the Group are interest cover and gearing covenants under the terms of the Senior Bank Facility, with which we have fully complied during both the current period and the prior period.
The Group manages the capital structure to maintain an investment grade credit rating and has and will continue to take the appropriate measures to maintain this.
For example, where new equity is needed, the Group will issue the minimum required in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating.
This is determined in connection with detailed discussions with credit rating agencies prior to raising new equity.
Fair value estimation The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities less than one year, other than derivatives, are considered to be approximate to their book values.
In accordance with the IFRS 7 classification hierarchy all derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2.
This means that they are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates.

The bank borrowings are floating rate liabilities.
The majority bear interest at rates set in advance by reference to LIBOR in the case of sterling and US dollars and to EURIBOR in the case of euro borrowings.
The capital market issuances in place at 30 September 2010 bear interest pre interest rate swaps at a fixed rate throughout their life.
129 Strategy Performance Governance Financials Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Borrowings and Derivative Financial Instruments continued The impact of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage the resultant interest rate risk arising is shown in section iv below.

The capital market issuances in place at 30 September 2009 bear interest pre interest rate swaps at a fixed rate throughout their life.
The impact of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage the resultant interest rate risk arising is shown in section iv below.
130 iv Derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS and the Group chooses to designate the derivative financial instrument as a hedge.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.
However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, and as permitted under IAS 39, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations, as permitted by IAS 39, in order to minimise income statement volatility.
See section vi below for details.
The information contained in sections ii and iii above shows the underlying borrowing position before the effect of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
The Group separates its borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into floating interest rates shortly after issue.
The following tables set out the Groups borrowings and derivative financial instruments at 30 September 2010, and demonstrate the Groups use of derivative financial instruments to manage the Groups foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures.
The tables present the nominal value of such instruments used to calculate the contractual payments under such contracts, analysed by maturity date, together with the related weighted average interest rate where relevant.
Seven of the interest rate swaps have embedded options and assumptions have been made based on market information and from counterparties expectations at 30 September 2010 to determine whether, and if so when, such options are likely to be exercised in order to determine the probable maturity date.
Details of these options and the expected maturity dates are included in the footnotes to the relevant tables.
The actual maturity date could be earlier or later depending upon future market conditions and a cancellation would not result in a cash flow other than in respect of interest outstanding at the cancellation date.
The effect of the cancellation of any of these interest rate swaps would be to reduce the proportion of the Groups borrowings that were at a fixed rate, increasing the Groups exposure to cash flow interest rate risk.
Shortly after any such cancellation Group Treasury would, if deemed necessary as part of the management of interest rate risk, transact further interest rate swaps to replace the cancelled swaps.
It is currently believed that there is sufficient appetite amongst counterparties for such transactions.
Debt is issued in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance.
