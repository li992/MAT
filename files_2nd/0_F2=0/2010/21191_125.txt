NEDs receive a basic annual fee in respect of their Board duties.
A further fee is paid to NEDs other than the chairman in respect of membership and, where appropriate, chairmanship of Board committees.
Fees are reviewed annually and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience.
In determining the level of fees paid to the NEDs the Board receives recommendations from the EDs, who consider the NEDs duties and responsibilities, together with the time commitment required in preparing for and attending meetings, and the amounts paid by competitors and similar-sized companies.
There were no increases to fees during 2010.
However, following a review in December 2010 of Avivas fees against market benchmarks and consideration of the expected changes in the workloads and responsibilities of certain committee members in light of regulatory requirements, the following changes in NEDs emoluments were made with effect from 1 January 2011: The fee for Board membership was increased from 63,000 pa to 65,000 pa The fee for the senior independent director in addition to Board membership fee was increased from 20,000 pa to 25,000 pa The fee for chairing the Risk Committee inclusive of membership fee was increased from 20,000 pa to 35,000 pa The fee for chairing the Remuneration Committee inclusive of membership fee was increased from 20,000 pa to 30,000 pa The membership fee for the Risk Committee increased from 5,000 pa to 10,000 pa The membership fee for the Nomination Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee increased from 5,000 pa to 7,500 pa The Chairman and NEDs do not participate in any incentive or performance plans or pension arrangements and they also do not receive an expense allowance.
The Companys articles of association provide that the total aggregate remuneration paid to the chairman and NEDs will be determined by the Board within the limits set by shareholders.
The current aggregate limit of 1.5 million was approved by shareholders at the Companys 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The amount paid in 2010 was 1.2 million.
EDs are remunerated under their service contracts and receive no additional fee for serving as directors.
