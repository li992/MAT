Following this review impairment triggers were noted in relation to Yuzhgazenergie YGE in Russia and Poltava Petroleum Company PPC in Ukraine.
See note 5 e and 5 f for the results of the YGE test.
Ukraine Following the implementation of a new Tax Code in Ukraine effective 1st January 2011, which has resulted in rental charges being levied on oil and gas production effective from 1st January 2011 see note 21, the Group determined that this represented an impairment trigger for its Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex.
The NovoNikolaevskoye Complex consists of four production licences, Ignatovskoye, Molchanovskoye, Novo-Nikolaevskoye and Rudenkovskoye.
An impairment test was therefore undertaken.
The test compared the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit CGU, being the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex for the purpose of the review, to the carrying value of the CGU.
The estimate of recoverable amount was based on fair value less costs to sell, derived by estimating discounted after tax cash flows for the CGU based on estimates that a typical market participant would use in valuing such assets.
The impairment review has been undertaken in US Dollars.
The key assumptions used in the impairment tests were: Production profiles: these were based on the latest available 2P reserves 39.1 MMboe, provided by independent reserve engineers.
Gas prices: these were based on current prices being achieved, escalated for the remainder of 2011 only, in line with public statements made by Ukrainian Government officials.
The gas price is assumed to increase in line with US Dollar inflation after 2011.
Capital and operating costs: based on development programmes and previous experience.
Post tax nominal discount rate: 12.2%.
Accordingly the impairment test is dependent upon judgment used in determining such assumptions.
Having undertaken the review it was concluded that the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex was not impaired.
5. e Exceptional item impairment of Russian assets Russia Following the 2007 acquisition of YGE in Russia, a technical and environmental re-evaluation of YGEs Koshekhablskoye gas field re-development was undertaken by the Group.
The re-evaluation resulted in a revised development plan and production profile.
The development plan and production profile have continued to be refined since that time.
The anticipated cost of the development plan has further increased and first gas sales from the project are now expected in Autumn 2011, three years later than originally planned.
Anticipated convergence of Adygean gas prices to net back European levels is now later than previously expected.
The current level of gas prices in Russia is lower than those anticipated in March 2010 when an impairment review was last undertaken for YGE.
The Company considers the reduced gas price and uncertainty about the future rates of increase as constituting an impairment trigger in accordance with IAS 36 and accordingly an impairment test was therefore undertaken.
The test compared the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit CGU, being YGE for the purpose of the review, to the carrying value of the CGU including goodwill.
In accordance with IAS 36, the impairment review has been undertaken in Russian Roubles.
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing were: Production profiles: these were based on the latest available information provided by independent reserve engineers, such information including 2P reserves 44.8 MMboe, 3P and contingent resources.
Economic life of field: it is assumed YGE will be successful in extending the licence term beyond its current 2026 expiration to the economic life of the field expected to be around 2032.
Gas prices: these were based on the Russian governments intention to achieve net-back convergence with the European gas markets, which the Group has assumed as occurring in 2017 2009: 2015, which is consistent with 90 Group accounts Notes to the accounts continued views expressed by many market commentators.
The gas price is assumed to increase in line with US Dollar inflation after 2017 2009: 2015.
Capital and operating costs: these were based on project estimates provided by third parties.
Post tax nominal Rouble discount rate of 13.5% 2009: 15.9%.
This was based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model analysis consistent with that used in previous impairment reviews.
No value was attributed to 3P and contingent resources.
The changes in the key assumptions used from previous periods has resulted in the asset being impaired by $74.6m consisting of goodwill of $2.0m and property, plant and equipment of $72.6m.
The main driver of the impairment has been the lower sales prices anticipated in the early years together with a longer period before net back European gas price parity is achieved.
The Group has recognised the impairment charge as an exceptional charge within the accounts.
The associated tax effect on the exceptional charge is a deferred tax credit to the income statement of $14.5m.
The impact on the impairment calculation of applying different assumptions to production, gas prices, capital expenditure and post-tax discount rates based on 2P reserves, would be as set out below.
Increase Decrease to impairment loss for Yuzhgazenergie CGU $m Impact if production: Increased by 1% 4 Decreased by 1% 4 Impact if gas price: Increased by 1% 4 Decreased by 1% 4 Impact if capital expenditure Increased by 1% 1 Decreased by 1% 1 Impact if post-tax discount rate Increased by 1% 17 Decreased by 1% 19 5. f Goodwill Goodwill was recognised in 2007 in relation to the Groups acquisition of Yuzhgazenergie LLC YGE.
The goodwill arose after the application of IAS 12 Income Taxes, and was attributable principally to expanded growth opportunities in Russia.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, and following the Groups decision that an indication of potential impairment arose in relation to the property, plant and equipment for reasons more fully disclosed in 5 e a review for impairment of the related goodwill was undertaken.
The carrying amount of the goodwill was allocated to the YGE Cash Generating Unit CGU as described above.
The test compared the recoverable amount of the CGU, being YGE for the purpose of the review, to the carrying value of the CGU including goodwill.
The calculations use the same assumptions as used for property, plant and equipment as more fully described in 5 e. 2010 2009 $000 $000 At 1st January 2,101 2,165 Impairment of goodwill refer to 5 e 2,032 Foreign exchange equity adjustment 69 64 At 31st December 2,101 6.
Long term receivables Long term receivables consist of VAT recoverable on expenditures incurred in Russia.
The receivables will be recovered against input VAT on future gas sales.

The scheme rules are described in the Directors Remuneration Report and repeated below.
All share-based payments are equity settled.
At 31st December 2010, there were outstanding options under various employee share option schemes, exercisable during the years 2011 to 2020 2009: 2010 to 2019, to acquire 2,593,724 2009: 2,099,551 shares of the Company at prices ranging from 0.00 to 4.54 per share 2009: 0.68 to 4.54.
The vesting period of the options is 3 years, with an exercise period of 7 years, making a 10 year maximum term.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options during the year.
During the year share options were granted in accordance with the new share option schemes, the Discretionary Share Option Scheme DSOS and the Performance Share Plan PSP, which were introduced in 2010.
They reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of their guidelines in March 2001 the ABI Guidelines.
2010 Share Option Schemes DSOS The DSOS is made up of two parts.
Options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company granted under Part A are Approved Options and options to acquire Shares granted under Part B of the DSOS are Unapproved Options.
No consideration shall be payable for the grant of an Option.
675,500 options were granted under DSOS in 2010.
The exercise price of options granted under DSOS is 241p.
For these options to vest there has to be an increase in the Groups Earnings Per Share EPS growth over the performance period measured over the 3 consecutive calendar years commencing 1st January 2010.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year under the DSOS was 119.3p per option.
PSP PSP are granted solely to Executive Directors.
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2010 AGM, Executive Directors will receive awards under the 2010 Performance Share Plan in the form of nil cost options.
No consideration is required to be paid for the grant or exercise of an Option.
395,500 options were granted under PSP.
The PSP options provide a conditional right to acquire shares at nil cost subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions and continued employment with the Group.
For these options to vest a comparison is performed between the Groups TSR against the FTSE 250 index half the options and the All-Share Oil & Gas Producers index other half of options.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year under the PSP was 130.9p per option.
JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 99 Pre 2010 Share Option Schemes In 2009, share options were granted in accordance with The New Approved Share Option Scheme and the New Unapproved Share Option Scheme collectively the 2001 Share Option Schemes that were introduced in 2001.
The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2009 under the New Approved Share Option Scheme and the New Unapproved Share Option Scheme was 56.90p per option.
Fair value of share options granted The fair value of options granted under the DSOS is estimated as at the date of grant using a variance of the Binomial model, taking into account terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related to the Companys earnings per share directly.
No dividends are paid on shares under the scheme prior to exercise.
The fair value of options granted under the PSP is estimated as at the date of grant using a variant of the Monte Carlo model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related to the TSR directly.
The fair value of share options previously granted under the 2001 Share Option Schemes is estimated as at the date of grant using a variant of the standard binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related to the Companys share price directly.
The performance condition based on performance relative to other companies is modeled with a Monte Carlo model.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31st December 2010 and 31st December 2009.
The expected future volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility.

The full details of the bonus performance criteria are explained in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 63.
The bonus accrued for 2010 was $0.9m 2009: $1.4m and was paid in January 2011.

Profits made overseas will not be able to be offset by costs elsewhere in the Group.
This could lead to a higher than expected tax rate for the Group.
Taxation in Ukraine The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities.
Ukrainian tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development, with new laws coming into effect at times which can conflict with others and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively.
Managements interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may at times not coincide with that of the tax authorities.
As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position and results of operations.
Since PPCs inception in 1994 the Company has operated in a regime where conflicting laws have often existed, including in relation to effective taxes on oil and gas production.
Various laws and regulations have existed and have implied a number of variable rates.
PPC has at times since 1994 sought clarification of their status regarding a number of production related taxes, and has been subject to a number of such taxes, at various rates, which have been paid and accounted for within Operating Costs within the Group Income Statement.
In late 2009, coinciding with the lead up to the recent Presidential election in Ukraine, PPC was subjected to increased operational pressures in several areas, including broader taxation.
Specifically, application of production related tax pre 2009 has attracted scrutiny.
On 1st January 2010 yet another law came into force in Ukraine in the area of production related tax, the Law of Ukraine on On Rent Charges for Oil, Natural Gas and Gas Condensate which had been suspended since 2004.
During 2010 conflicting laws most particularly the Law of Ukraine on Amending Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine which may be a basis for the Ukrainian Tax Authorities to assert that further production related taxes are due from various oil and gas companies, including PPC for periods through to 31st December 2010.
PPC will continue to seek clarification from advisors and the tax authorities concerning rules of calculation and payment of various production related taxes for periods through to 31st December 2010.
The statutory period of limitation in Ukraine for such matters is three years.
If PPC was subject to maximum production related taxes over the three year period to 31st December 2010, increased production related taxes could have been an amount equivalent to approximately twenty percent of Ukraine gross revenues net of corporate tax savings.
In particular, the Group considers that the likelihood of additional production related taxes for the period from January 2008 to December 2008 is remote on the basis of tax audits completed, and the related legal position.
The Group also believes the possibility of any penalties or interest for any period, to be remote.
The Group would exhaustively challenge the payment of any further production related taxes over and above those it has already paid for the period through 31st December 2010.
Given the lack of clarity over the legal position, in conjunction with the arguments the Group has to defend its position, the Group considers that no payments are likely to be made in the next 12 months.
Further, the Group has flexibility in relation to capital and other expenditure to mitigate impact of any future additional production related payments on the Groups financial position.
A new tax code became effective in Ukraine on 1st January 2011 replacing most of the previous tax laws.
The new tax code has removed uncertainty over the applicability of rental fee payment by PPC from 2011 and accordingly PPC has been liable to and is paying such fees.
The fees are levied on production volumes in accordance with a rates schedule which may change from time to time.
Such payments will be recorded as a cost of sale and therefore be accounted for after revenue and before operating profit.
Deferred tax A deferred tax liability of $11.5m 2009: $18.4m arises in respect of PPCs activities, $nil 2009:$9.6m in respect of Yuzhgaznergie LLCs activities and $0.5m 2009: $1.4m in respect of Hungarian activities.
A deferred tax asset of $5.7m 2009: $nil has been recognised in respect of brought forward UK losses, $7.9m 2009: $nil in respect of Yuzhgaznergie LLC comprising losses and temporary differences.
No other deferred tax has been recognised.

There is no expiry date on the remaining losses.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the unprovided deferred taxation items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise these deductible temporary differences.
In March 2011, a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax was announced in the UK Budget.
The main rate of corporation tax effective from 1st April 2011 will be reduced from 27% to 26%.
The impact of the rate reduction is not expected to have a material impact on provided and unprovided UK deferred taxation.
In December 2010 a new Ukrainian tax rate was introduced.
New tax rates in the Ukraine will be as follows: from 1st January 2011 to 31st March 2011 25%: from 1st April 2011 to 31st December 2011 23%: in 2012 21%: in 2013 19%: after 31st December 2013 16%.
The deferred tax asset has therefore been recognised with due consideration of the tax rate effective on the expected unwinding of those temporary differences.

Ukrainian and Russian business environment Ukraine and Russia display emerging market characteristics, and the legislation and business practices regarding banking operations, foreign currency transactions and taxation are constantly evolving as the governments attempt to manage the economies.
Risks inherent in conducting business in an emerging market economy include, but are not limited to, volatility in the financial markets and the general economy.
Uncertainties over the development of the tax and legal environment, as well as difficulties associated with the consistent interpretation and application of current laws and regulations, have continued.
As at 31st December 2010, oil and gas assets based in Ukraine and Russia represent approximately 45% 2009: 54% and 49% 2009: 36% respectively of the Groups oil and gas assets.
The Groups operations and financial position may be affected by these uncertainties.
The Groups financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability, and classification of assets or the amounts or classifications of liabilities that may result from these uncertainties.
Post balance sheet events On 31st March 2011, PPC entered into a reducing credit facility agreement with Credit Agricule CIB France secured by indemnity provided by the parent company, JKX Oil & Gas plc.
