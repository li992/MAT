The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Groups life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Groups life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
The negative shareholders funds balance within the UK with-profit funds arises in NWPSF as a result of regulatory valuation and admissibility differences in the reattributed estate which is valued on a realistic regulatory basis compared to the disclosure on an IFRS basis.
NWPSF is fully supported by the reattributed estate of 1,218 million this is known as RIEESA, at 31 December 2010 31 December 2009: 1,177 million, held within NPSF1 a non-profit fund within UKLAP included within other UK life operations, in the form of a capital support arrangement.
This support arrangement will provide capital to NWPSF to ensure that the value of assets of NWPSF are at least equal to the value of liabilities calculated on a realistic regulatory basis therefore it forms part of the NWPSF available capital resources.
For the WPSF RIEESA, equity market performance has had little impact, as the funds mitigate materially all of the equity risk of the estate RIEESA through internal hedging.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 16.6 billion 2009: 17.1 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year-end transfers to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds have available capital of 3.4 billion 2009: 2.9 billion including amounts held in RIEESA.
Subject to certain conditions, the RIEESA capital can be used to write new non-profit business, but the primary purpose of this capital is to provide support for the UK with-profit business.
The capital is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin, and therefore the shareholders are not required to provide further support.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 13.2 billion 2009: 14.2 billion is significantly higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
As the total available capital of 16.6 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently, it understates the economic capital of the business which is considerably higher.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited to Aviva Annuity Limited to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
Financial statements IFRS 287 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 56 Capital statement continued The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the FSAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the FSAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the FSA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.

Realistic liabilities adjusted to eliminate the shareholders share of future bonuses are 41.5 billion 31 December 2009: 42.1 billion.
These realistic liabilities make provision for guarantees, options and promises on a market consistent stochastic basis.
The value of the provision included within realistic liabilities is 1.9 billion, 0.3 billion and 3.1 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF respectively 31 December 2009: 2.2 billion, 0.3 billion and 3.1 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF respectively.
Estimated realistic inherited estate at 31 December 2009 was nil, 0.2 billion and 1.6 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF respectively.
This represents the reattributed estate of 1.2 billion at 31 December 2010 31 December 2009: 1.1 billion held within the non-profit fund with WPSF included within other UK life operations.
The WPSF fund includes the Provident Mutual PM fund, which has realistic assets and liabilities of 1.7 billion and therefore does not impact the realistic inherited estate.
The risk capital margin RCM is 3.7 times covered by the inherited estate and support arrangement 31 December 2009: 3.6 times.
Under the FSA regulatory regime, UK life with-profits business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU directives regulatory peak and the FSA realistic bases realistic peak described above.
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the FSA requirements.
For overseas businesses in the EEA, US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the FSA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: i UK with-profit funds NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF any available surplus held in each fund can be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself, be distributed to policyholders and shareholders or in the case of NWPSF and OWPSF, transferred via the capital support arrangement explained above for OWPSF only to the extent support has been provided in the past.
In most cases, with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund.
ii UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital in the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iii Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iv General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
