The bond return is based on current market yields.
The corporate bond yield has been reduced to allow for an element of default risk.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long-term growth prospects for the economy in general, the long-term relationship between each asset class and bond returns, and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.
Excluding any self-investment through pooled fund holdings, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund has no investments 2009: nil in Imperial Tobacco Group PLCs own financial instruments.
