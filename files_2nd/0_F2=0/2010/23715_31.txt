On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our thanks to I look forward to working with the Board, management team and Messrs. MacAndrew, Larcombe and Roggemann for their service staff to develop the strategy and operational plan for the business to F&C over a number of years.
so that F&C reaches its full potential.
In the brief period since becoming Chairman of F&C, I have met a significant number of staff from across the Group, including portfolio managers at Thames River and F&C REIT.
I have been impressed with the calibre of people I have met and, in particular, the strong sense of commitment to clients.
This reinforces my confidence in F&Cs prospects because asset management is without doubt a Edward Bramson people business and the Group possesses a strong reservoir of Chairman talented professionals who want F&C to be successful.
9 March 2011 Important progress has been achieved in a number of areas in laying solid foundations for a turnaround in F&Cs fortunes.
In particular, three year investment performance track records are competitive and 2010 saw encouraging trends in funds flows.
Further detail on developments during 2010 is provided in the Chief Executives report.
Our focus now is to build on the things that work well at F&C and to improve the Groups financial performance, which will create value for shareholders.

We will endeavour to minimise the time required for this process consistent with producing the right long-term plan for F&C.
