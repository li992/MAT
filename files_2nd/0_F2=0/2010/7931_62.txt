Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union collectively IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except where fair value measurement is required under IFRS as described below in the accounting policies on financial instruments, retirement benefit schemes, share schemes, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period and of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date.
The key estimates and assumptions are set out in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements note on pages 110 and 111.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances and constitute managements best judgement at the date of the financial statements.
In the future, actual experience may deviate from these estimates and assumptions.
This could affect future financial statements as the original estimates and assumptions are modified, as appropriate, in the year in which the circumstances change.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.
Adoption of IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements The adoption of IAS 1 Revised has had no impact on the net assets or results of the Group, resulting only in changes to the format and content of the primary statements including derivative financial instruments assets and liabilities including comparatives being classified according to their settlement as described below.
Classification of Derivative Financial Instruments Between Assets and Liabilities Derivative financial instruments providing commercial hedges but not designated as hedges for accounting purposes under IAS 39 were previously all classified as current assets and liabilities.
Since it is our intention to hold these financial instruments to maturity we have, following the adoption of IAS 1 Revised, now classified them according to their contractual cash settlements with the following effects.
30 September 2009 30 September 2008 Previously Previously million reported Reclassification Reclassified reported Reclassification Reclassified Non-current derivative financial instrument assets 9 125 134 76 44 120 Current derivative financial instrument assets 239 41 198 97 2 99 Current derivative financial instrument liabilities 564 280 284 238 115 123 Non-current derivative financial instrument liabilities 669 364 1,033 2 161 163 Net derivative financial instruments 985 985 67 67 At 30 September 2010, under the previous method of classification, non-current derivative financial instrument assets wouldhave been nil, current derivative financial instrument assets would have been 549 million, current derivative financial instrument liabilities would have been 718 million and non-current derivative financial instrument liabilities would have been 271 million.
The revised treatment has no effect on profit or loss or net assets in 2008, 2009 or 2010.
Adoption of IFRS 8 Operating Segments The adoption of IFRS 8 has resulted in some presentational changes, but has not significantly affected the overall level of segmental analysis provided.
We have taken advantage of early adoption of 2009 annual improvements to IFRS 8 not to disclose segmental asset measures as they are not reported to the chief operating decision maker.
