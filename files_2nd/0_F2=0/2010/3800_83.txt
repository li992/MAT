Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The impact of the changes in statutory rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
This change has resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.

After netting off balances within countries, the following are the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet: 2010 2009 Net deferred tax balance m m Deferred tax assets 296 300 Deferred tax liabilities 15 11 Net deferred tax asset liability 281 289 Unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences amount to 94 million 2009: 67 million.
Of the total, tax losses of 58 million will expire at various dates between 2011 and 2018.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
As a result of changes to tax legislation, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
The unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such taxes is 128 million 2009: 174 million.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable that this will not take place in the foreseeable future.
