Arch cru Funds dealings in 2 open ended investment companies OEICs, for which Capita Financial Managers CFM is the authorised corporate director ACD and Arch Financial Products LLP was the delegated investment manager, were suspended on 13 March 2009, as a result of illiquidity in the underlying investments of the OEICs and an anticipated inability to meet future redemptions.
This was exacerbated by unprecedented market turmoil post the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Since the suspension, CFM has been working with specialist advisers to conduct a detailed review of the underlying assets of the OEICs and options for their future.
This review was completed in December 2009.
The underlying assets of the OEICs have fallen in value and remain illiquid.
CFM has advised investors that the only feasible option in the best interests of investors as a whole is for the OEICs to be wound up, with the underlying assets being realised in an orderly manner over a period of time, and the proceeds being returned to investors in the OEICs.
In addition, CFM has informed investors in the OEICs that it is undertaking a review to determine whether such investors have suffered any detriment and, if so, to what extent any of the parties involved should be responsible for compensating them.
This is a complex exercise involving a number of parties including CFMs regulator and it is taking longer than anticipated, but we are determined to ensure that the matter is concluded in a way that takes appropriate account of the results of the review and the interests of investors in the OEICs, but also recognises the interests of Capitas shareholders.
The final liability to CFM and to the Group remains subject to uncertainties.
At 31 December 2010, the Directors continue to provide 18.5m which they believe represents the most likely future total cost to the Group.
This figure has been disclosed separately from the Groups underlying profit in our accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The Directors expect that insurance cover will be available in respect of certain costs regarding this matter.
It is expected that an outcome will be reached in 2011.
Insurance provisions relate to provisions held by the Groups captive insurer.
Such provisions are held until utilised or such time as further claims are considered unlikely under the respective insurance policies.
Other relates to provisions in respect of potential litigation claims arising due to the nature of some of the operations that the Group provides.
These are likely to unwind over a period of 1 to 3 years.
