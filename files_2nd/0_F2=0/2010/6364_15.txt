G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 119 a Signifi cant accounting policies continued Derivative fi financial instruments and hedge accounting continued Derivative fi financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as fi financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the profi t and loss account, unless they qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, thetreatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below: Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the profi t and loss account.
Cash fl ow hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the profi t and loss account when the hedged cash fl ow impacts the profi t and loss account.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the profi t and loss account.
Leases Annual rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to the profi t and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The fi financial statements of the company are presented in sterling, its functional currency.
Transactions in currencies other than sterling are translated attherates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.

The group presents its consolidated fi financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company therefore hedges a substantial portion of the groups exposure to fl uctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profi t and loss account.
The company no longer uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans.
This foreign exchange hedging programme was terminated in February 2009.
The company believes cash fl ow should not be put at risk by these instruments in order to preserve thecarrying value of net assets, given the changed liquidity environment post the global credit crisis.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 134m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fi xing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at fl oating rates as described in note 29 to the consolidated fi financial statements exposes the group to cash fl ow interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fi x the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of fi five years.
At 31 December 2010 the nominal value of such contracts was 134m in respect of US dollar 2009: 170m and 167m in respect of euro 2009: 218m, their weighted average interest rate was 5% US dollar 2009: 5.0% and 3.7% euro 2009: 3.7 %, and their weighted average period to maturity was one and a half years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash fl ow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 123 h Financial risk continued Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps continued The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fi xed rate market, with investors looking for a fi xed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the fi first issue in March 2007, the company was comfortable with the proportion of fl oating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fi xed rate debt arranged fi xed to fl oating swaps effectively converting the fi xed coupon on the Private Placement to a fl oating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fi xed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profi t and loss atthesame time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on the GBP Public Bond issued in May 2009 was kept at fi xed rate.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fl uctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
The company acts as amarket intermediary, arranging commodity swaps and commodity options with its relationship banks with back to back deals on identical terms with its subsidiaries to fi x synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Counterparty credit risk The companys strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the fi financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception ofthe transaction, the fi financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the companys relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2010 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were 37m and 21m and both were held with institutions with long-term Moodys credit ratings of Aa3.
These exposures represent 39% 2009: 40% and 21% 2009: 20% of the carrying values of derivative fi financial instruments, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had signifi cant loans outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2010.
The company participates in the groups multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an Aa3 rated bank.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.
i Provisions for liabilities and charges Onerous contracts m At 1 January and at 31 December 2010 1 The onerous contracts provision comprises a provision against future liabilities for all properties sub-let at a shortfall and for long-term idle properties.
Theprovision is based on the value of future net cash outfl ows relating to rent, rates, service charges and costs of marketing the properties.
