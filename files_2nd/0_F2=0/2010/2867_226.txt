Business Review Governance Accounts The Capita Group Plc 118 26 Financial instruments Notes to the consolidated financial statements Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments are comprised of cash, bank loans, bond issues, loan notes, finance leases and derivatives.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions.
These are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, callable interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
Their purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments The following table analyses by classification and category the Groups financial instruments excluding short term debtors, creditors and cash in hand that are carried in the financial statements.

To remove the Groups exposure to currency fluctuations it has entered into currency swaps which effectively hedge the movement in the bonds fair value due to changes in prevailing foreign exchange and interest rates.
The interest rate swap is being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of GBP denominated bonds.
The fair value of the currency and interest swaps are disclosed in note 17 Financial assets and in note 23 Financial liabilities in the current year.

The valuation models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and volatility surfaces.
Unlisted equity securities and investment loans are held at amortised cost.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with multiple counterparties, all of which are financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2010 2009 m m At 31 December 2010 Assets measured at fair value Cash flow hedges 11.6 10.8 Interest rate swaps in relation to GBP denominated bonds 4.4 3.3 Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 189.9 136.6 Liabilities measured at fair value Bonds 966.4 720.5 Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 11.4 0.6 Callable swaps 37.5 30.9 During both years the Group only had Level 2 assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
Consequently, during the year ended 31 December 2010, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
Included in the total carrying value of the Groups bonds of 1,016.4m 2009: 720.5m, 50m is carried at amortised cost rather than fair value 2009: nil.
At 31 December 2010 the carrying value of these bonds at amortised cost was equivalent to their fair value at that date.
Business Review Governance Accounts The Capita Group Plc 120 26 Financial instruments continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the Groups long term debt.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Group has primarily issued fixed rate coupon US$ denominated bonds, which have been swapped to floating rate GBP liabilities at the date of issuance using currency swaps.
These currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of the bonds due to changes in prevailing foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
In February 2008, Capita executed a series of callable interest rate swaps to convert from paying floating rate GBP interest to fixed rate GBP interest on certain of its swapped bonds.
The counterparty holds the option to cancel these swaps on each semi-annual coupon payment date.
These callable interest rate swaps are not designated in any hedge relationship so their change in fair value is recognised in net finance costs in the income statement see note 10 Net finance cost.
Following the fall in interest rates at the end of 2008 these callable swaps show a negative mark to market value of 37.5m at 31 December 2010 2009: negative mark to market value of 30.9m.
This movement results in a non-cash accounting loss in the year of 6.6m 2009: profit of 1.1m.
The callable swap will reverse through the income statement as the mark to market valuation will tend towards zero as the swaps approach maturity or cancellation.
In addition to the fixed rate bonds of 429.6m in issue as at 31 December 2010 underlying value not adjusted for the impact of the swaps, the Group had a further 403m of swapped bonds, and a 425m revolving credit facility, both paying floating rate interest.
This gives the Group as a whole a balanced interest rate risk profile through the use of both fixed and floating rate financial instruments.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December is as follows: Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total m m m m At 31 December 2010 m m m Fixed rate Loan notes 2.3 2.3 Bonds 24.8 100.5 15.1 25.0 379.5 544.9 Obligations under finance leases 1.3 1.1 2.4 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 0.1 12.4 4.7 98.2 115.4 Callable swaps 1.2 6.8 1.0 2.6 25.9 37.5 Floating rate Cash in hand 38.5 38.5 Overdrafts and bank loans 98.8 98.8 Investment loan 1.0 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 24.2 36.2 Assets available for sale 3.0 0.7 3.7 Bonds 93.9 377.6 471.5 Asset-based securitised financing 11.7 11.7 Cash flow hedges 5.0 2.8 2.6 1.6 0.8 1.2 11.6 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 4.3 0.1 4.4 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 17.5 45.6 63.1 Business Review Governance Accounts The Capita Group Plc 121 26 Financial instruments continued Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 12 years 23 years 34 years 45 years 5 years Total m m m m At 31 December 2009 m m m Fixed rate Loan notes 2.6 2.6 Bonds 24.1 98.1 13.9 328.4 464.5 Obligations under finance leases 0.1 1.3 1.4 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 0.6 10.1 3.5 71.4 84.4 Callable swaps 1.6 6.4 0.8 22.1 30.9 Floating rate Cash in hand 181.5 181.5 Term debt 198.0 198.0 Investment loan 36.7 36.7 Assets available for sale 0.4 0.3 0.7 Bonds 256.0 256.0 Asset-based securitised financing 17.1 17.1 Cash flow hedges 2.0 2.4 1.4 1.4 0.6 3.0 10.8 Interest rate swap in relation to GBP denominated bonds 3.3 3.3 Foreign currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 51.6 51.6 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.

Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group has covenanted to maintain a specified consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated net interest expense coverage ratio, the terms of which have been adhered to during the year.
The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in the light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
The Group does not set a target level of gearing but uses capital opportunistically to add value for shareholders.
The key discipline adopted by the Group is to widen the margin between the return on capital employed and the cost of that capital as shown in the business review on pages 36 to 37 and 43.
