Unite 83 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 19. employee benefits continued Fair value of share options and assumptions The fair value of services received in return for share options granted after 7 November 2002 is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
Service conditions and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement.
The estimates of the fair value of the share options granted is measured based on the following models: Option scheme Model used Reason for model used Unapproved and approved share option Monte Carlo simulations combined Monte Carlo simulations used to schemes, LTIP TSR component with binomial lattice model FTSE comparator groups for TSR performance condition combined with for share options binomial lattice to incorporate seven-year exercise window SAYE share option scheme Black-Scholes Service condition only, short exercise window makes a fixed date model appropriate ESOT bonus awards, LTIP NAV Discounted share price at grant Awards equates to a gift of free component shares with a performance service condition.

Financial instruments The Group holds or issues financial instruments for two main purposes: To finance the development and subsequent retention of investment properties: To manage the interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables arise from the Groups operations.
All financial instruments are sterling denominated.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments or derivatives.
The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and fresh issues of equity.
The Group borrows from major banking institutions primarily at floating rates of interest, using derivatives where appropriate to generate the desired effective interest rate basis.
The derivatives used for this purpose are interest rate swaps and caps.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and market price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, they are discussed in the Business review and are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits are managed by using interest rate swaps, caps and in some cases, simple fixed rate borrowing.
The Groups policy is separated into three areas: i Development finance After taking account of interest rate swaps, 27 million of the Groups development borrowing at 31 December 2010 2009: nil is fixed.
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment.
Other Financial Governance Business Introduction statements information review Unite 84 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 notes to the financial statements continued 20.
Financial instruments continued ii Refinancing risk The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates, which affect the quantum of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups ability to release equity from its developments.
The Group currently manages this risk by retaining swaps of 39.6 million relating to investment properties that have recently been sold with the intention of allocating them against imminent new developments.
Prior to this reallocation these swaps were commercially hedging loans against completed properties.
The Group policy also allows this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps.
iii Medium and long-term finance The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under floating rate arrangements.
The majority of this debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2010, the Groups policy has been to hedge in excess of 50% of the Groups exposure forterms of approximately 215 years.
At 31 December 2010, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 97% 2009: 75% of the Groups medium and long-term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates.
The current high percentage is a result of the swaps retained that related to disposed properties referred to above.
Excluding the 39.6 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 6.8% 2009: 6.6% for an average period of 3 years 2009: 4 years.
Including these swaps the average rate is 7.0%.
Liquidity risk With respect to its development activities, the Directors have adopted a policy whereby the Group injects substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt under associated facilities.
In this way, thefunding requirements of each scheme are substantially ring fenced and secured at the outset of works.
Some of the Groups banking facilities contain loan to value covenants, which if property values fall far enough may require some debt to be repaid.
This position is closely monitored on a regular basis and the Group develops strategies that will minimise the impact of any such repayments on other operations.
The year-end position on covenant compliance is shownbelow.
Some of the Groups medium-term banking facilities are revolving, allowing the Group to apply its cash surpluses in the temporary reduction of its debt obligations.
Market risk The Groups primary market risk is interest rate exposure.
It monitors this exposure through a process of sensitivity analysis, estimating the effect on operating cash flow over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2010, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.3 million 2009: 0.9 million.
Effective and ineffective interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk, provided the effects of the various potential changes in rates remain within certain prescribed parameters.

Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.

The Groups overall average cost of debt as at 31 December 2010 is 6.9% 2009: 5.45%.
The average cost of the Groups investment debt excluding the additional 39.6 million of swaps referred to above at 31 December 2010 is 6.1% 2009: 5.7%.

The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year.
The fair values of interest rate swaps and fixed rate loans shown in the table below have been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates.
The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities do not differ from their book values other than as shown below: 2010 2010 2009 2009 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Fixed rate loans 39.4 40.8 39.9 41.4 Capital management The Groups financing strategy is based around its developer and co-investing manager business model, which allows capital from stabilised developments sold to UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund to be recycled into new schemes.
TheBoard has adopted this business model to achieve an appropriate balance between the capital deployed in mature, lower return investment and higher yielding development opportunities.
The Board regularly reviews the capital available to the business with a view to ensuring that the Group has an appropriate capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and sustain the future development of the business.
The Board has processes in place to ensure capital is only committed to new schemes, for site purchase or build, when thereis sufficient capital available.
These processes also ensure that capital is allocated to the opportunities offering the greatest return.
