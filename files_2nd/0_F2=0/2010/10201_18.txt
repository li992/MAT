Consolidated financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 April 2010 1 Segmental reporting In accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the Group has derived the information for its operating segments using the information used by its Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group has identi ed the Executive Committee as the Chief Operating Decision Maker as it is responsible for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.
Operating segments are consistent with those used in internal management reporting and the pro t measure used by the Executive Committee is the adjusted operating pro t as set out in note 4.
In prior years, costs were reported on a geographical basis.
Resources are now managed on a global basis and accordingly the Executive Committee does not measure costs or operating pro t by segment, and therefore the Group no longer reports operating pro t by segment.

A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
The Finance No 2 Act 2010 is expected to include legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
It is expected that the effect of these changes will have an immaterial impact on the deferred tax asset currently recognised.

Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit CGU.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
CGUs represent the operations of a country, or in more material operations, divisions within a country.
It has been determined that the Group has four CGUs, the three geographical segments North America, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and India and the Rest of the World and the AMQ business that arose from the acquisition of Borland and the AMQ division of Compuware.
These four also form the primary reporting divisions of the Group.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30 April each year.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on the value in use VIU calculations.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash ow projections for a CGU.
The cash ow projections in the three financial years following the budget year re ect managements expectation of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash ows.
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to each CGU represents a pre-tax rate that re ects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and risks speci c to the CGU.
The discount rate applied to each CGUs operations was: 2010 2009 North America 16.8% 11.0% Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and India 15.1% 11.0% Rest of the World 15.5% 11.0% AMQ 15.6% Not applicable Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 62 9 Goodwill continued Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The long-term EBITDA margins applied to each CGU is 42.5% 2009: 38.6% which is the margin applicable to each CGU.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows The long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows are assumed to be no greater than the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the countries in which the CGU operates and were 2% 2009: 1.5%.
The long-term growth rates are applied consistently across all CGUs as: The businesses within the CGUs have similar trading characteristics: Future forecasts are considered to be similar across all CGUs: Business risks are considered to be the same across all CGUs: The Group is expected to have no net debt at 30 April 2011 and during the 12 months to 30 April 2011 all CGUs will be similarly impacted as the Group repays its bank loans.
Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2009: nil.
As the VIU calculation is most sensitive to a change in the long-term operating model, the directors are of the opinion that it would take a systematic change to the market for long-term operating margins to fall to the level where an impairment would be required.
The directors consider that a reduction of 4% in the absolute value of long-term operating margins across all CGUs would be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is exible and could quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of geographies and sectors and also offers customer cost saving solutions, which help to insulate it from more signi cant changes.
If the long-term margins used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 4% lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
If the operating margins remain in perpetuity at the current year levels then there would also not be any impairment charge.
The Group bases its estimate for the long-term pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC using long-term market data and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The directors have assessed that a 2% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably possible and this would represent a 15% reduction in the assumption.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash ows of all CGUs were 2% higher in absolute terms than the managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
The Group considers that the long-term growth rates could change and that a 1% change is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 1% lower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognised any goodwill impairment charge.
The directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term operating margins across all CGUs combined with a reasonably possible increase in the absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.
The medium-term operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The medium-term EBITDA margins applied to each CGU is 42.5% 2009: 38.6%.
The medium-term growth rates of net operating cash ows are assumed to be 7% for each CGU 2009: 7%.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life see accounting policy 1Hd.
At 30 April 2010, the unamortised lives of technology assets were in the range of four to eight years and for customer relationships in the range of three to nine years.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual debtor.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30 April 2010, the carrying amount of financial assets within trade and other receivables approximated their fair value.
At 30 April 2010, trade receivables of $25.4 million 2009: $13.1 million were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are regarded as recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 38 days in excess of due date 2009: 35 days.
As at 30 April 2010, trade receivables of $2.2 million 2009: $1.6 million were either partially or fully impaired.
The amount of the provision was $2.2 million 2009: $1.6 million.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: 2010 2009 $000 $000 Three to four months 321 Over four months 2,225 1,272 Total 2,225 1,593 Movements in the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables were as follows: 2010 2009 $000 $000 At 1 May 1,593 1,217 Provision for receivables impairment 1,186 643 Acquisition of subsidiaries 696 114 Receivables written off as uncollectable 1,311 275 Exchange adjustments 61 106 At 30 April 2,225 1,593 The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged in the allowance account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

16 Borrowings 2010 2009 $000 $000 Bank loan secured 101,000 At 30 April 2010, the Group had a three year secured $215 million revolving credit facility in place, denominated in US dollars, which expires on 6 May 2012.
Interest on the facility is payable at US Dollar LIBOR plus 2.5% until 30 April 2010 and thereafter at rates from US Dollar LIBOR plus 2.25% depending on covenant ratios.
The Group incurred total issue costs of $6.7 million in respect of the facility.
These costs are being amortised over the term of the facility using the effective interest method.
The facility is guaranteed by principal companies within the Group.
The revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants.
These include a minimum ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net borrowings, EBIT to net finance costs and total acquisition exceptional costs.
These covenants were adhered to during the year.

Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 67 Consolidated financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 April 2010 continued 20 Financial instruments Risk management The Groups treasury function aims to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available as and when required, and to invest cash assets safely and pro tably.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments.
The treasury functions policies and procedures are reviewed and monitored by the audit committee and are subject to internal audit review.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups currency exposures comprise only those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures re ect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
Note 3 shows the impact of foreign exchange gains in the year.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and bene ts for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt.
At 30 April 2010, the Group had net debt of $68.2 million and gearing of 24% 2009: nil.
The Group expects to be net cash positive by the end of April 2011.
