The decrease of 80% is mainly due to the impact of the abolition of industrial building allowances in 2009.
In the absence of the industrial building allowances adjustment in 2009, the effective rate would have been 31%.
d Unrecognised tax losses The Group has tax losses of 7.1 million 2009: 8.2 million which have arisen in AquaGib Limited for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and it is not expected that the subsidiary will utilise significant amounts in the foreseeable future.
The losses are, however, available for offset against future taxable profits arising in the subsidiary without time limit.
e Temporary differences associated with Group investments No deferred tax liability was recognised in the Groups 2009 financial statements in respect of the unremitted earnings of the Groups overseas subsidiaries on the basis that none of the undistributed profits were expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future.
As a result of changes in UK tax legislation which largely exempt from UK tax overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009, no temporary differences and therefore no deferred tax liabilities arise at 31 March 2010 as the Group does not expect to suffer a tax charge on any future distributions.
