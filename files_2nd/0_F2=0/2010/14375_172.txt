The fair value liability related to these schemes was nil in both 2009 and 2008, this was materially the same as intrinsic value.
Share Based Payments Long-Term Incentive Plans In 2004, a share based incentive plan was introduced for executive directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The plan includes a Performance Share Plan PSP and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP award shares is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry.
Under the CIP, participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for three years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased.
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan.
This plan is designed to encourage executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
Under the plan, up to one third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee will be compulsorily deferred into shares which vest, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years i. e. one third each year.
Nofurther performance conditions willapply to the deferred shares.
From 2010, Performance Share awards are granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all executives other than Executive Directors.
Awards granted under both plans are combined to provide the figures below.
Vesting of the share awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry.
The fair values of awards granted under long term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
The exercise price for all awards granted under the long term incentive plans is nil.
Performance Share awards under both the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
Given the wide range of companies within the FTSE 100 a correlation of 35% 2009 30%, 2008 15% has been assumed with the constituents of the group.
A correlation of 35% 2009 30%, 2008 15% has also been assumed for the companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors.
The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is a combination of EPSA growth and the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR performance over the three year performance period.
The other assumptions used are consistent with the executive scheme assumptions disclosed in Note 25 a of the Notes to the Group Accounts.
