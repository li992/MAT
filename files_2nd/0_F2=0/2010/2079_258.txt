Notes to Financial Statements continued 28 Financial risk management The Group financial risk management strategy The financial risks arising from the Groups operations comprise market, liquidity and credit risk.
These risks arise in the normal course of business, and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Groups Portfolio Risk Management Strategy.
The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Groups financial targets while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Groups operations and activities.
A Cash Flow at Risk CFaR framework is used to measure the aggregate and diversified impact of financial risks upon the Groups financial targets.
The principal measurement of risk is CFaR measured on a portfolio basis which is defined as the worst expected loss relative to projected business plan cash flows over a one-year horizon under normal market conditions at a confidence level of 95 per cent.
The CFaR framework includes Board-approved limits on the quantum of the CFaR relative to the Groups financial targets.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices.
Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.
This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings which is measured under the CFaR framework.
In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in four distinct but related activities.
The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes.
Activity Key risk management processes 1 Risk mitigation 4ffXff`Xag bY cbegYb b 69TE TZT afg Board-approved limits Hedging of revenues with financial instruments may be executed to mitigate risk at the portfolio level when CFaR exceeds the Board-approved limits.
Similarly, and 8kXVhg ba bY geTafTVg baf j g[ a on an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to specific approved mandates and significant expenditure on investments or capital projects will be executed if necessary to support the Groups strategic objectives.
2 Economic hedging of commodity sales, operating costs and debt instruments 4ffXff`Xag bY cbegYb b 69TE TZT afg Board-approved limits Where group commodity production is sold to customers on pricing terms that deviate from the relevant index target, and where a relevant derivatives market @XTfhe aZ TaW eXcbeg aZ g[X XkcbfheX a Vhfgb`Xe exists, financial instruments may be executed as an economic hedge to align the commodity contracts and issued debt instruments revenue price exposure with the index target.
8kXVhg aZ [XWZ aZ WXe iTg iXf gb T Za g[X gbgT Zebhc Where debt is issued in a currency other than the US dollar and or at a fixed exposure to the index target interest rate, fair value hedges may be executed to align the debt exposure with the Groups functional currency of US dollars and or to swap to a floating interest rate.
3 Strategic financial transactions 8kcbfheXf `TaTZXW j g[ a iT hX Tg e f TaW stop loss limits Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture value from perceived market over under valuations.

These activities are in support of 8kcbfheXf `TaTZXW j g[ a TccebiXW `TaWTgXf aV hW aZ our underlying commodity businesses and provide market and commercial insight.
position limits, value at risk limits and stop loss limits Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Group Management Committee.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed rate financial instruments.
Interest rate risk is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
The majority of the Groups debt is raised under central borrowing programs.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of the centrally raised debt into US dollar floating rate exposures.
As at 30 June 2010, the Group holds US$2,577 million 2009: US$7,696 million of fixed interest borrowings that have not been swapped to floating rates, arising principally from debt raised during the year ended 30 June 2009 and debt raised prior to the DLC merger.
The Groups strategy has not changed and the remainder of the fixed rate debt raised during the year ended 30 June 2009 has been swapped to floating interest rates since 30 June 2010.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate component of the Groups net borrowings.

These are discussed in Currency risk below.
Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2010, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Groups profit after taxation and equity by US$2 million 2009: increase of US$23 million.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed floating mix and balances are constant over the year.
However, interest rates and the debt profile of the Group may not remain constant in the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
Currency risk The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise: geTaf Tg baT XkcbfheX a eXfcXVg bY aba YhaVg baT VheeXaVl `baXgTel gX`f geTafTVg baT XkcbfheX a eXfcXVg bY aba YhaVg baT VheeXaVl XkcXaW gheX TaW eXiXahXf The Groups foreign currency risk is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy within the overall CFaR limit.

The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The following table shows the foreign currency risk arising from financial assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operations.
Net financial assets liabilities US$ A$ SA rand GBP Other Total 2010 US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M Functional currency of Group operation US dollars 1,398 90 31 942 2,219 Australian dollars 1 1 UK pounds sterling 4 4 3 1,398 90 31 942 2,216 Net financial assets liabilities US$ A$ SA rand GBP Other Total 2009 US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M Functional currency of Group operation US dollars 1,895 306 87 248 1,750 Australian dollars UK pounds sterling 3 3 3 1,895 306 87 248 1,747 In March 2009, the Group issued a two tranche Euro Bond, comprising 1,250 million of 4.75 per cent Euro Bonds due 2012 and 1,000 million of 6.375 per cent Euro Bonds due 2016.
Cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts were taken out to hedge the currency risk on these bonds.
These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency risk associated with the Euro Bonds.
The fair value of these derivatives is as follows: Fair value 2010 2009 US$M US$M Cross currency swaps Euro to US dollar swaps Pay fixed received fixed Later than five years 63 Forward exchange contracts Euro to US dollar foreign exchange contract Pay US dollar receive Euro Not later than one year 79 Total fair value of derivatives 142 During the year ended 30 June 2010, the cash flow hedge relationships have been fide-designated.
Interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts were taken out and have been designated as fair value hedges for risks associated with the Euro Bonds.
These are discussed in Interest rate risk above.

Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2010, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held constant, would have affected post-tax profit and equity as follows: 2010 2009 US$M US$M Currency movement Post-tax profit Equity Post-tax profit Equity 1 cent movement in Australian dollar 9 8 11 11 0.2 rand movement in South African rand 2 5 3 5 1 pence movement in UK pound sterling 1 1 The Groups financial asset and liability profile may not remain constant, and therefore these sensitivities should be used with care.
Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These currency risks are managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
When required under this strategy the Group enters into forward exchange contracts.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows relating to operating activities is an asset of US$22 million 2009: a liability of US$5 million.
Commodity price risk Contracts for the sale and physical delivery of commodities are executed whenever possible on a pricing basis intended to achieve a relevant index target.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index, derivative commodity contracts are used when available to return realised prices to the index.
Contracts for the physical delivery of commodities are not typically financial instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at cost typically at nil : they are therefore excluded from the fair value and sensitivity tables below.
Accordingly, the financial instrument exposures set out in the tables below do not represent all of the commodity price risks managed according to the Groups objectives.
Movements in the fair value of contracts included in the tables below are offset by movements in the fair value of the physical contracts, however only the former movement is recognised in the Groups income statement prior to settlement.
The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.

Provisional pricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative and are carried at fair value as part of trade receivables.
The Groups exposure at 30 June 2010 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales volumes is set out in the following table.
2010 2009 Impact on Impact on equity and equity and profit of 10% profit of 10% movement in movement in Net exposure market price Net exposure market price receive post-tax receive post-tax Units of exposure deliver US$M deliver US$M Copper 000 tonnes 237 100 235 76 The sensitivities in the above tables have been determined as the absolute impact on fair value of a 10 per cent increase in commodity prices at each reporting date, while holding all other variables, including foreign currency and exchange rates, constant.
The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange can impact commodity prices.
The sensitivities should therefore be used with care.
Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with shortand long-term forecast information.
Additional liquidity risk arises on debt related derivatives due to the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.
During the year ended 30 June 2010, Moodys Investors Service made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A1 the short-term credit rating is P-1.
Standard & Poors made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A the short-term credit rating is A-1.
The Groups strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.
The Groups policy on counterparty credit exposure ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.
There were no defaults on loans payable during the period.

To manage credit risk the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits and daily monitoring of exposures against these limits.
As part of these processes the financial viability of all counterparties is regularly monitored and assessed.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying value of relevant financial assets on the balance sheet as at the reporting date.
The Groups credit risk exposures are categorised under the following headings: Counterparties The Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties: EXVX iTU Xf VbhagXecTeg Xf The majority of sales to the Groups customers are made on open terms.
CTl`Xag ZhTeTagXX VbhagXecTeg Xf A proportion of sales to Group customers occur via secured payment mechanisms.

6Tf[ aiXfg`Xag VbhagXecTeg Xf As part of managing cash flow and liquidity, the Group holds short-term cash investments with a range of approved financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties.
Geographic The Group trades in all major geographic regions.
Countries in which the Group has a significant credit risk exposure include South Africa, Australia, the US, Japan and China.
Where appropriate, secured payment mechanisms and other risk mitigation instruments are used to protect revenues from credit risk losses.
Industry In line with our asset portfolio, the Group sells into a diverse range of industries and customer sectors.
This diversity means that the Group is not materially exposed to any individual industry or customer.
The following table shows the Groups receivables at the reporting date that are exposed to credit risk and the ageing and impairment profile thereon.

These terms and conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customers credit quality and prevailing market conditions.
Receivables that are classified as past due in the above tables are those that have not been settled within the terms and conditions that have been agreed with that customer.
For an analysis of movements in impaired receivables, refer to note 10.
The credit quality of the Groups customers is monitored on an ongoing basis and assessed for impairment where indicators of such impairment exist.
The solvency of each debtor and their ability to repay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.
In certain circumstances the Group may seek collateral as security for the receivable.
Where receivables have been impaired, the Group actively seeks to recover the amounts in question and enforce compliance with credit terms.
No other financial assets were past due or impaired at 30 June 2010 30 June 2009: nil.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
This measurement of fair value is principally based on quoted market prices.
Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Groups views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.
The financial assets and liabilities are presented by class in the tables below at their carrying values, which generally approximate to the fair values.
In the case of US$2,577 million 2009: US$7,696 million of centrally managed fixed rate debt not swapped to floating rate, the fair value at 30 June 2010 is US$3,031 million 2009: US$8,277 million.

Valuation hierarchy The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated with reference to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income.
The following table shows the Groups financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value with reference to the nature of valuation inputs used.

b Valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, either directly i. e. as unquoted prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
c Valuation is based on inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Sensitivity of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that are valued using inputs other than observable market data are calculated using appropriate valuation models, including discounted cash flow modelling, with inputs such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and inflation.
The potential effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions in these models, based on a change in the most significant input by 10 per cent, while holding all other variables constant, is shown in the following table.
Significant inputs are assessed individually for each financial asset and liability.

The Group manages capital with the goal of maintaining levels of gearing designed to optimise the cost of capital and return on capital employed, while also growing the business consistently through project developments and acquisitions.
The Groups priorities for cash flow are: eX aiXfg`Xag a ceb]XVgf g[Tg VTeel TggeTVg iX eTgXf bY eXghea eXZTeW Xff bY g[X XVbab` V V `TgX Vb`` g`Xag gb T fb W 4 VeXW g eTg aZ eXghea aZ XkVXff VTc gT gb f[TeX[b WXef i T W i WXaWf TaW VTc gT `TaTZX`Xag Ybe XkT`c X f[TeX Uhl UTV f The Groups strategy is focused on upstream, large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, export-oriented assets and the Group continually reviews its portfolio to identify assets which do not fit this strategy.
The Group will invest capital in assets where they fit our strategy.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets.
