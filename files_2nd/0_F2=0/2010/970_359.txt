3 Fair value of the convertible bond represents the quoted price of the debt and therefore includes the portion accounted for in equity.
The fair value of financial liabilities is determined by reference to its quoted market price, otherwise the carrying value approximates fair value.
Fair value hierarchy An analysis of financial liabilities carried at fair value is set out below: 2010 2009 1 2 3 1 2 3 US$ million level 1 level 2 level 3 total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At fair value through profit and loss Trade and other payables 434 434 315 315 Other financial liabilities derivatives 775 60 835 3 543 113 659 1,209 60 1,269 3 858 113 974 1 Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
This category includes exchange-traded derivatives.
2 Valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
Financial instruments included within level 3 primarily consist of embedded derivatives where valuation depends upon unobservable inputs and commodity sales contracts which do not meet the conditions for the own use exemption under IAS 39.
There have been no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 in the year ended 31 December 2010.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial liabilities are shown in the following table: US$ million 2010 2009 At 1 January 113 269 Net gain recorded in remeasurements 121 21 Net loss recorded in underlying earnings 6 1 Reduction in assumed life of financial liability 181 Reclassification to from level 3 Other financial assets derivatives 41 35 Currency movements 27 5 At 31 December 60 113 1 Relates to reduction of embedded derivative liability at Loma fide Nquel which was recorded in operating special items.
For the level 3 financial liabilities, changing certain inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions may change the fair value significantly.
At 31December 2010 the effect of a change in these assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative assumption was not considered significant.
At 31 December 2009, where significant, the effect of a change in these assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative assumption is outlined in the table below.
These sensitivities have been calculated by amending the fair value of the level 3 financial liabilities at 31 December 2009 for a change in each individual assumption, as outlined below, whilst keeping all other assumptions consistent with those used to calculate the fair value recognised in the financial statements.
2009 Increase decrease US$ million Change in assumption in fair value of liabilities Other financial liabilities derivatives Increase of 5% in dividend forecast 9 Decrease of 5% in dividend forecast 9 Financial liability risk exposures are set out in note 25.
