16 DEFErrED TAx Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences under the liability method using applicable local tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 18.8m 2009: 16.6m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 7.6m 2009: 6.3m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Tax losses may be carried forward.
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future.
