This has resulted in a tax credit in the income statement of 0.8m.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main corporation tax rate of 1% each year reducing the main tax rate down to 24% by April 2014.
The future 1% main tax rate reductions are expected to have a similar impact on the financial statements as the current year, however the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at that time.

Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to a bi-annual impairment review, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill arising on acquisition is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit CGU to the carrying value.
The goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning and Price Limited, which now trade as Pub Restaurants.
Previously, the goodwill arising on each acquisition was assessed individually but, following the program of modifying the former Blubeckers sites to bring them more in line with the Brunning & Price style of operation, it is now considered appropriate to evaluate them in aggregate.
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year business plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.5% 2009: 10.96% which is the rate believed by the Directors to reflect the risks associated with the CGU.
Since 1 January 1989 the cumulative amount of goodwill written off against realised reserves is 50.4m 2009: 50.4m.
Records for periods prior to this date are not readily available.

Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group.
Options were valued using a Stochastic option pricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
Note: The one-off scheme is in respect of Alan Jacksons share options granted on 5 June 2001.
During the year Alan Jackson exercised 200,000 options under this scheme, and as at 2 January 2011 there are no share options outstanding.
No charge to the income statement is recognised in respect of Alan Jacksons share options as they were granted prior to 7 November 2002.
60 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements Long-Term Incentive Plan On 9 November 2005 an Extraordinary General Meeting of The Restaurant Group plc approved the adoption of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for the Group, details of which are provided in the Directors remuneration report on pages 29 to 36.
Awards under the LTIP are generally reserved for senior management level and above.
Conditional Award share options and Matching Award share options are granted to Directors and selected employees.
In respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee is required to acquire a number of shares by a specified date, known as Deposited shares, and retain these shares until the Matching Award share options vest, for these Matching Award share options to be valid.
The table below summarises the dates of awards under the LTIP and the dates by which Directors and employees were required to acquire their deposited shares.
Date of Award Date by which Deposited Shares must be acquired 7 December 2005 7 May 2006 8 March 2007 30 June 2007 6 March 2008 30 June 2008 5 March 2009 30 June 2009 4 March 2010 30 June 2010 Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal period in which they are exercisable.
On publication of the 2010 results, the Conditional and Matching Awards granted on 6 March 2008 become exercisable.
The vesting criteria for the Total Shareholder Return TSR element of the Conditional Award were met in full and consequently, 100% of this part of the award will vest.
Earnings per share EPS growth of the 2010 results compared with the 2007 results was between RPI 4% and RPI 10% and consequently, 82.5% of the EPS element of the Conditional Award and the Matching Award will vest.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the five days prior to invitation.
Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each month for the three-year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise these options before the end of the three-year savings period.
Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model.

In order to calculate volatility, the movement in the return index share price plus dividends re-invested over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the remaining period over which the performance condition applies has been calculated.
For the SAYE awards and for the discount for the TSR performance condition for the relevant Conditional Awards, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 3.25 years and 3 years respectively prior to the grant has been used.

The Group borrows at floating rates and during 2010 and 2009, used interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile.
The use of any financial instruments is carefully controlled and monitored by the Board in line with the Groups treasury strategy and the terms and conditions of its facilities.
Managements approach to treasury is to: ensure sufficient committed loan facilities are in place to support anticipated business requirements: ensure the Groups debt service will be supported by anticipated cash flows and that covenants will be complied with: and manage interest rate exposure with a combination of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, when appropriate.
Further details on the business risk factors that are considered to affect the Group and more specific financial risk management including sensitivity to increases in interest rates are included in the report of the Directors on pages 18 to 25.
Further details on market and economic risk is included in the Chief Executive Officers review of operations on pages 6 to 11.

The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 1.30% 2009: 1.22%.
After taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps, the average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 2.98% 2009: 4.06%.
64 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 24 Financial instruments and derivatives continued On 19 December 2007 the Group entered a 5 year facility agreement for 120m which was utilised from 17 January 2008.
Interest is payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the banks margin, which is dependent on the debt to EBITDA ratio.
The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.
At 2 January 2011 the Group has 70.0m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings 27 December 2009: 50.0m and 10.0m of undrawn overdraft 27 December 2009: 10.0m of undrawn overdraft.
The maturity profile of anticipated gross future cash flows, including interest, relating to the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, are set out below: At 2 January 2011 Trade and other Floating Finance payables rate lease excluding tax loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 Within one year 68,997 926 296 70,219 Within two to five years 51,170 1,184 52,354 After five years 6,016 6,016 68,997 52,096 7,496 128,589 Less: Future interest payments 2,434 4,428 6,862 68,997 49,662 3,068 121,727 At 27 December 2009 Trade and other Floating Finance payables rate lease excluding tax loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 Within one year 67,979 1,146 276 69,401 Within two to five years 74,358 1,103 75,461 After five years 6,299 6,299 67,979 75,504 7,678 151,161 Less: Future interest payments 5,989 4,684 10,673 67,979 69,515 2,994 140,488 Effective from 16 January 2006, the Group entered into an interest rate swap for an initial notional amount of 20m, rising to 50m from 18 April 2006 until 16 January 2008, when it reduced to 30m until 16 January 2009, when it terminated.
The fixed rate for the duration of the three years was 4.695%.
Effective from 18 January 2008 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 25m for three years.
The fixed rate for the duration of the three years was 4.92%.
On 8 February 2010 the interest rate swap was terminated on payment of 1.0m.
Effective from 16 January 2009 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 20m for two years.
The fixed rate for the duration of the two years was 2.70%.
Effective from 16 January 2009 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 20m for three years.
The fixed rate for the duration of the three years was 2.975%.
On 9 February 2011 the interest rate swap was terminated on payment of 0.4m.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 65 Notes to the accounts continued 24 Financial instruments and derivatives continued Fair value of financial assets and liabilities At 2 January 2011, the Group had derivative financial instruments relating to interest rate swaps and these have been valued in accordance with IAS 39.
The fair value measurement of these financial instruments is categorised as Level 1, being derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities.
The fair value of these instruments was 0.6m and this is accounted for as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet 2009: 2.2m liability.
The movement in fair value, after taking into consideration the 1.0m cash paid on termination of one of the swaps, has been recorded as a non-trading item in the consolidated income statement.
All financial assets and liabilities, excluding the interest rate swaps, are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the carrying value to approximate their fair value.
b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of retrospective discounts receivable from suppliers but the Directors believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 10.4m plus interest due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Groups associate company Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited.
This debt is secured on the assets of Living Ventures Restaurants Limited, but is subject to a prior ranking behind LV Finance Limiteds bank.
In 2007, following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business including the loan note receivable, the Board made full provision against the loan note due further details are provided in note 13.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facilities by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facilities, which mature in 2012 as set out in note a above ensure continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the report of the Directors on pages 18 to 25. d Foreign currency risk As the Group operates primarily within the United Kingdom any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is limited.
The Group operates three restaurants in Spain that are serviced by local Euro denominated debt.
The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile.
The Group no longer has an interest rate swap, following the early repayment of the swap scheduled to terminate in 2012, as the reduction in the level of debt throughout 2010 combined with current market conditions results in a low level of exposure.
The Groups exposure will continue to be monitored and the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.
66 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 25 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Minimum Present value of minimum lease payments lease payments 2010 2009 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 Within one year 296 276 296 276 Within two to five years 1,184 1,103 907 845 After five years 6,016 6,299 1,865 1,873 7,496 7,678 Less: Future interest payments 4,428 4,684 Present value of lease obligations 3,068 2,994 3,068 2,994 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 296 276 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,772 2,718 Present value of lease obligations 3,068 2,994 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 3.1m 2009: 3.0m.
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2010 2010 2009 2009 Payments due: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 47,719 3,399 44,904 3,229 Within two to five years 170,417 11,124 166,751 11,287 After five years 372,325 28,682 348,197 30,062 590,461 43,205 559,852 44,578 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concession division, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the estimated amount payable.
26 Capital commitments 2010 2009 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 13,251 9,043 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 67 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
28 Related party transactions Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Groups 38% holding.
A loan note of 10.4m is due from LV Finance, a subsidiary of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, which attracts interest at the rate of LIBOR.
During the year ended 2 January 2011, 0.1m of interest was accrued of which the Group recognised nil 2009: 0.2m of which the Group recognised nil.
Consequently, in addition to the 10.4m loan note outstanding at 2 January 2011, 1.2m interest had accrued, of which all was overdue under the terms of the agreement.
Further details are provided in note 13.
