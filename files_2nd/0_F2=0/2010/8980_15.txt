152 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35.
Financial risk management continued There were no material impairments of trade receivables during the year ended 31 December 2010 or 2009.
The solvency of the debtor and their ability to repay the receivables were considered in assessing the impairment of such assets.
Within Kazakhmys Copper, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods for sales to European customers.
Sales to Chinese customers are made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
Payment from European and Chinese customers is subject to provisional pricing and then final pricing adjustments.
Kazakhmys Copper is therefore exposed to the residual final pricing adjustment for each sales transaction although such amounts are not considered material.
Kazakhmys LLC also provides certain social services to municipal authorities in the communities in which it operates as part of its contractual obligations under its subsoil licences.
For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, full provision is recognised in light of past payment history.
Kazakhmys Gold has a single long standing customer with short payment terms which are agreed via an annual sales contract.
Kazakhmys Power receives cash upfront or has short payment terms depending on the nature of the customer.
MKM has put in place credit insurance for the majority of its sales and credit limits are set by the credit insurance company depending on the financial strength and location of each customer.
For those sales where credit insurance is not available, short payment terms and regular dialogue with customers ensures credit risk is kept to a minimum.

Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups Treasury Committee in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy.
Investment of cash and deposits are made only with approved counterparties of high credit worthiness and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital purposes, with the funds in the UK being held primarily with major European and US financial institutions with minimum ratings of Standard & Poors Aand Moodys A3 and triple-A rated liquidity funds.
These limits are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets and updated accordingly.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate any financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non-performance of the counterparties to derivative financial instruments.
