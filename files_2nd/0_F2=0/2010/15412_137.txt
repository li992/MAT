30 Retirement benefit obligations a Plan information The Group maintains pension plans for its operations throughout the world.
Some of these arrangements are defined benefit pension schemes with retirement, disability, death and termination income benefits.
The retirement income benefits are generally a function of years of employment and final salary.
The principal schemes are funded and their assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The schemes are funded in line with local practice and contributions are assessed in accordance with local independent actuarial advice.
The schemes operated by the Group are subject to independent actuarial valuation at regular intervals using consistent assumptions appropriate to conditions prevailing in the relevant country.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out as at 31 March 2007 by independent actuaries.
The Group also maintains defined contribution pension schemes and some fully insured pension schemes.
On 1 April 2002, the main United Kingdom scheme was closed to new members.
A defined contribution pension scheme has been established to provide pension benefits to new United Kingdom employees.
Under the projected unit method, the service cost of the closed scheme will increase as the members approach retirement.
During the year, the Group initiated a consultation process on the proposal that the main United Kingdom pension scheme be closed to future accrual from 6 April 2011.
At the same time, the decision that the Group would no longer fund early retirements was communicated to members.
The proposal to close to future accrual was confirmed by the Group on 31 March 2010.
These changes give rise to exceptional items in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2010 Note 7.
The Groups subsidiaries in the USA provide unfunded retirement medical and life assurance benefits to their employees.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 38 million to its defined benefit plans in the year to 31 March 2011. b Principal assumptions The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: Pension benefits Medical Year to 31 March 2010 UK US Others benefits Inflation rate 3.7% 2.5% 2.0% 2.5% Expected rate of salary increases 4.5% 3.5% 2.0% n a Expected rate of pension increases 3.5% n a 1.3% n a Discount rate 5.5% 5.7% 4.8% 5.6% Expected return on plan assets total 5.9% 7.5% 6.3% n a Expected equity return on plan assets 8.1% 8.4% 7.5% n a Pension benefits Medical Year to 31 March 2009 UK US Others benefits Inflation rate 2.7% 2.5% 2.0% 2.5% Expected rate of salary increases 3.5% 3.5% 2.0% n a Expected rate of pension increases 2.7% n a 1.0% n a Discount rate 6.9% 7.3% 6.3% 7.1% Expected return on plan assets total 6.6% 7.9% 5.9% n a Expected equity return on plan assets 8.5% 8.8% 7.0% n a Expected longevity post age 65 Mortality assumptions Year to 31 March 2010 UK US Male aged 65 now 21 years 19 years Male aged 65 in 20 years time 24 years 19 years Female aged 65 now 22 years 21 years Female aged 65 in 20 years time 24 years 21 years Expected longevity post age 60 Mortality assumptions Year to 31 March 2009 UK US Male aged 60 now 26 years 23 years Male aged 60 in 15 years time 28 years 23 years Female aged 60 now 27 years 25 years Female aged 60 in 15 years time 29 years 25 years The expected retirement age assumption has been changed to 65 due to the removal of the discretionary early retirement terms as described in a above.
