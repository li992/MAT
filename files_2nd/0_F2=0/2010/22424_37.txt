In pursuing its investment objective and policy, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks market risk comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Board and the Portfolio Manager co-ordinate the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to manage the risks that are set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
16.1 Market risk The fair value of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises market price risk see note 16.1.
2 and interest rate risk see note 16.1.
The Portfolio Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of investments.
The Companys investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about the future prices of the investments.
Management of the risk The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the Managers compliance with the Companys objectives, including investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Company may buy sell put or call options or futures on indices and on equity investments in its portfolio to manage its exposure to price risk or to generate income.
At 30 June 2010 the Company had open positions with a negative value of 248,000 2009: nil.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 10 and 11.
This shows that the majority of the Companys investments are in UK listed companies.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to the UK, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Market price risk sensitivity The sensitivity of a the return after taxation for the year and b the Companys net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair values of the Companys investments at each balance sheet date is shown on the next page.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible, based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk The Company is not itself materially exposed to currency risk, although some of the investments will be in companies that have operations that involve currency risk and pay dividends in foreign currencies.
Management of the risk Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
However, the Company does sometimes hedge foreign currency exposure ahead of the declaration of dividends from companies in which it invests.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30 June 2010 are 173,000 2009: 71,000.
Foreign currency sensitivity The Companys sensitivity to movements in exchange rates affecting its investment income, assuming a 10% movement in the Sterling US Dollar rate will be a loss of 607,000 2009: 530,000 if Sterling strengthens and a profit of 742,000 2009: 648,000 if Sterling weakens.
The 10% movement has been based on average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the level of income receivable from cash at bank and on deposit the interest payable on the Companys variable rate bank borrowings.
Management of the risk The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts have not been used during the year to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The Companys exposure at 30 June 2010 of financial assets and financial liabilities to fixed interest rate risk can be found in note 15.
The exposure to floating interest rates can be found on the balance sheet under cash at bank and under bank loans and overdrafts in note 14.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances is at a margin linked to HSBCs Base Rate 2009: linked to LIBOR Interest paid on borrowings under the overdraft facility provided by the custodian is at a margin over HSBCs Base Rate.

The figures in the more than 5 years columns do not include the ongoing annual finance cost of 157,000.
Interest rate risk sensitivity The Company is not materially exposed to changes in interest rates.
16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are in investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
For details of the Companys bank borrowing facility, see note 14.
The Board gives guidance to the Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings should be used to fund short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 30 June 2010, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, is given in the table above.
16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is not significant and is managed as follows: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the Portfolio Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
In summary, the exposure to credit and counterparty risk at 30 June 2010 was to cash at bank of 1,475,000 2009: 750,000 and to other receivables of 4,577,000 2009: 7,167,000 see note 13.
