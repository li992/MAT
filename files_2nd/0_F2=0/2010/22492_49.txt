Capital management The FSA supervises the group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the group as a whole.
In addition a number of subsidiaries are directly regulated by the FSA.
The aim of the capital adequacy regime is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system.
It is structured around three pillars: Pillar 1 on minimum capital requirements: Pillar 2 on the supervisory review process: and Pillar 3 on market discipline.
The groups Pillar 1 information is presented in the table on the next page.
Under Pillar 2, the group has completed a self assessment of risks in a process known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.
This has been reviewed by the FSA and the process culminated in the FSA providing Individual Capital Guidance on the level of capital the group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to hold.
Pillar 3 aims to encourage market discipline by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow market participants to assess key pieces of information on a firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the groups website www.
The groups policy has always been to be well capitalised and soundly funded.
The groups approach to capital management is driven by strategic and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which it operates.
In addition to maintaining a strong capital base to support the development of the business it is also important to ensure the group meets regulatory capital requirements at all times, and therefore maintains capital adequacy ratios comfortably above minimum regulatory requirements.
The groups individual regulated entities and the group as a whole complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject for the years ended 31 July 2010 and 2009.
A full analysis of the composition of regulatory capital and Pillar 1 risk weighted assets is shown in the following table, including a reconciliation between equity and core tier 1 capital after deductions.
The group capital ratios remained strong with core tier 1 ratio of 13.9% 2009: 14.8% and total capital ratio of 15.8% 2009: 16.6%.
The fall in the capital ratios was principally due to a significant increase in risk weighted assets as a result of growth in the loan book, including the acquisition of GMAC Commercial Finance Limited UK invoice financing loan book.
