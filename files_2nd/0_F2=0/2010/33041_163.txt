FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 29.
Retirement benefit plans continued Other features of the legal agreements with the Trustee for BT providing support to the scheme are: In the event that cumulative shareholder distributions exceed cumulative total pension contributions over the three year period to 31 December 2011, then BT will make additional matching contributions to the scheme.
Total pension contributions including regular contributions are expected to be approximately 2.4bn over the three financial years.
In the event that BT generates net cash proceeds greater than 1bn from disposals and acquisitions in any 12 month period to 31 December 2011 then BT will make additional contributions to the scheme equal to one third of those net cash proceeds.
A negative pledge that provides comfort to the scheme that future creditors will not be granted superior security to the scheme in excess of a 1.5bn threshold.
The intention is for there to be sufficient assets in the scheme to pay pensions now and in the future.
Without any further contribution from the company, it is estimated that at 31 December 2008, the assets of the scheme would have been sufficient to provide around 57% of the members benets with an insurance company.
If the group were to become insolvent, however, there are a number of additional protections available to members.
Firstly, there is the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984.
The scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee is being confirmed by the Trustee through the courts.
This applies, on a winding up of the group, as a minimum to pension entitlements for anyone who joined the scheme before 6 August 1984, and to payments to beneciaries of such persons.
Secondly, the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay certain benets to members.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed that governs the BTPS, the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.
Share-based payments The total charge recognised in 2010 in respect of share-based payments was 71m 2009: 141m, 2008: 73m.
The company has an employee share investment plan and savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in the United States.
It also has several share plans for executives.
All share-based payment plans are equity settled and details of these plans and an analysis of the total charge by type of award is set out below.

Share options BT Group Employee Sharesave Plans There is an HMRC approved savings related share option plan, under which employees save on a monthly basis, over a three or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a xed price determined when the option is granted.
This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five year plans and 10% for three year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, for employees in the US, enables participants to purchase American Depositary Shares ADSs quarterly at a price which is 85% of the fair market price of an ADS at the end of each quarterly purchase period.

Share-based payments continued The following are legacy option plans which are no longer operated by the group: BT Group Global Share Option Plan GSOP The options granted in previous years were exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets.
Options must be exercised within ten years of the grant date.
BT Group Legacy Option Plan GLOP On the demerger of 0, BTs share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee Sharesave plans and the 2 BT Group GSOP.
The BT GLOP was launched on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and demerger of 0 in November 2 2001, and is therefore outside the scope of IFRS 2.
The options were exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets.
Options must be exercised within 10 years of the original grant date.
Share plans Employee Share Investment Plan ESIP The ESIP is an HMRC approved plan.
It allows BT employees to buy shares with contributions of up to 1,500 per tax year out of gross pay directshare and allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years allshare.
In 2008, allshare was replaced by free broadband for all BT employees in the UK.
Employees outside the UK continue to receive awards of shares where practicable, otherwise they will receive awards equivalent to the value of free shares.
During 2010, 13.7m directshare shares 2009: 10.7m directshare shares, were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 19,730 2009: 20,384 employees at a total cost of 15.0m 2009: 16.4m.
A further 1.0m shares 2009: 3.3m shares were purchased by the Trustee through dividend reinvestment on behalf of 20,120 2009: 21,782 allshare and directshare employee participants.
At 31 March 2010 79.2m shares 2009: 75.9m shares were held in trust on behalf of 68,444 participants 2009: 76,678.
Incentive Share Plan, Retention Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan Under the BT Group Incentive Share Plan ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group.
In 2010, the corporate performance measure for the ISP was amended.
For all ISP awards made in 2010, 50% of each share award is linked to a total shareholder return target TSR for a revised comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period and the remaining 50% is linked to a three year cumulative free cash ow measure.
The revised comparator group contains European telecommunications companies and companies which are either similar in size or market capitalisation and or have a similar business mix and spread to BT.
For ISP awards in prior periods, a single corporate performance measure was used, being BTs TSR measured against a comparator group of companies from the European telecommunications sector.
Under the BT Group Retention Share Plan RSP, the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest annually in tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the employee is still employed by the group.
Under the BT Group Deferred Bonus Plan DBP awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
In accordance with the terms of the ISP, RSP and DBP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.

Awards under the ISP are valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs were generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three year performance period, using each companys volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BTs historical volatility which is expected to reect the BT share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Sharesave options and for all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the RSP and DBP were determined using the market price of the shares at the date of grant.
The weighted average share price for RSP awards granted in 2010 was 104p 2009: 151p, 2008: 310p.
The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in 2010 was 131p 2009: 203p, 2008: 319p.
