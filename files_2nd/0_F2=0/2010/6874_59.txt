Segmentalanalysis The Board is considered to be the chief operating decision maker of the Group in the context of the IFRS 8 definition.
The information which is reviewed by the Board for the purposes of assessing financial performance and allocating resources comprise the profit and loss account for the company as a whole.
Throughout 2009 and 2010 the Group has progressively been reorganised into a centrally managed business with an integrated supply chain.
During 2009 the Groups 11 operating divisions were reorganised into seven retail regions, each reporting to the Group Retail Director.
These retail regions, and their predecessor divisions, have similar economic characteristics, products, customers and production and distribution methods and have therefore been aggregated into a single reportable segment.
The segment results, as reported to the chief operating decision maker, are calculated under the principles of IFRS.
Products and services the Group sells a consistent range of fresh bakery goods, sandwiches and drinks in its shops.
Major customers the majority of sales are made to the general public on a cash basis.
A small proportion of sales are made on credit to certain organisations but these are immaterial in a group context.
Geographical areas all results arise in the UK.
The Board has carefully considered the requirements of IFRS 8 and concluded that, as there is only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, assets and liabilities are measured and reported on a consistent basis with the group financial statements no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.
