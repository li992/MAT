Operatingleases Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows: 2010 2009 000 000 Less than one year 37,047 34,827 Between one and five years 100,655 101,821 More than five years 33,081 28,229 169,729 165,931 The Group leases the majority of its shops under operating leases.
The leases typically run for a period of 10 years, with an option to renew the lease after that date.
Lease payments are generally increased every five years to reflect market rentals.
For a small number of the leases the rental is contingent on the level of turnover achieved in the relevant unit.
The inception of the shop leases has taken place over a long period of time and many date back a significant number of years.
They are combined leases of land and buildings.
It is not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between land and buildings at inception.
Therefore, in determining lease classification the Group evaluated whether both parts are clearly an operating lease or a finance lease.
Firstly, title does not pass for the land or building.
Secondly, because the rent paid to the landlord for the buildings is increased to market rent at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the land or building it is judged that substantially all the risks and rewards of the land and building are with the landlord.
Based on these qualitative factors it is concluded that the leases are operating leases.
