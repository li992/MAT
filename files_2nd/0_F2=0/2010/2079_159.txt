2 Remuneration structure Our non-executive Directors are paid in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code formerly known as the Combined Code 2008 and the ASX Corporate Governance Council Principles of Good Corporate Governance 2007.
The Board is conscious that, just as it must set remuneration levels to attract and retain talented executives, it must also ensure that remuneration rates for non-executive Directors are set at a level that will attract and retain the calibre of Director necessary to contribute effectively to a high-performing Board.
The remuneration rates reflect the size and complexity of the Group, the multi-jurisdictional environment arising from the Dual Listed Companies structure, the multiple stock exchange listings, the extent of the geographic regions in which the Group operates and the enhanced responsibilities associated with membership of Board Committees.
They also reflect the considerable travel burden imposed on members of the Board.
In setting the remuneration of the Directors, the Committee takes into account the economic environment and the financial performance of the Group, along with pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Group.
Fees for the Chairman were reviewed in March 2010 when Jacques Nasser commenced as Chairman.
Fees for non-executive Directors were reviewed in July August 2010 and benchmarked against peer companies with the assistance of external advisers.
The table below sets out the fees before and after the 2010 review.
The aggregate sum available to remunerate non-executive Directors was approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meetings at US$3.8 million.

3 Retirement benefits The following table sets out the accrued retirement benefits under the now-closed Retirement Plan of BHP Billiton Limited.
The Retirement Plan was closed on 24 October 2003 and entitlements that had accumulated in respect of each of the participants were frozen.
These will be paid on retirement.
An earnings rate equal to the October 2003 five-year Australian Government Bond Rate is being applied to the frozen entitlements from that date.
