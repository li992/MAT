The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds: no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2007 and 1 April 2007 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 purposes for the periods to 31 January 2010, 1 February 2009, and 3 February 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
Following consultation with members and approval by the Board of Trustees, the Group became committed to the final proposals from the Pension Review on 2 July 2009.
The move from a final salary basis to career average revalued earnings CARE represents an accounting curtailment of certain pension liabilities.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits, the defined pension schemes obligations were revalued by the schemes actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date.
As a result a pensions credit of 91m has been recognised in comprehensive income during the year.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Pension Scheme gives the Trustees power to set the level of contributions.
In the Safeway Scheme this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 1 February 2010 is 42m 2009: 44m.
