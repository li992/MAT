Operating segments From a management perspective, the Group operates three operating units and therefore presents three operating segments for segment reporting purposes: F&C previously called Investment Management : F&C REIT previously called Property Asset Management has a separate Board with considerable autonomy and operationally F&C REIT is managed separately from the rest of the F&C Group: and Thames River Capital TRC, an investment management business acquired on 1 September 2010, has a separate Management Committee and operationally is managed separately from the rest of the F&C Group.
While there are different sources of revenue within the F&C operating segment and distinct distribution channels, and assets under management can be categorised by client type and asset class, the Directors do not consider these to constitute separate operating segments within the meaning of IFRS 8: Operating Segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its three operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Transfer prices between the operating segments reflect arms-length agreements entered into at the time of acquiring REIT and TRC and creating the F&C REIT and TRC operating segments.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include transactions between operating segments, which are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those of the Group.
Revenues from two external clients each represent 10% or more of the Groups total revenues.
Revenues from the largest client amount to 36.6m 2009: 35.1m and are earned in the F&C segment.
Revenues from the second largest client amount to 32.7m 2009: 29.8m and are earned in the F&C and F&C REIT segments.

Expenses a Total operating expenses Total operating expenses, including exceptional costs, can be summarised into the following categories: 2010 2009 m m Employee and member benefits and related expenses 125.0 121.6 Premises expenses 9.3 12.6 Communication and information technology expenses 14.4 13.5 Third party administration expenses 6.6 6.5 Promotional and client servicing expenses 6.4 5.5 Depreciation and amortisation expenses 54.1 53.3 Other expenses 31.5 19.4 Total operating expenses 247.3 232.4 This includes 5.6m 2009: 6.1m of employment related expenses, which are not included in the employee benefit expense table in note 5. b Operating expenses Operating expenses include the following: 2010 2009 Notes m m Depreciation of owned tangible property, plant and equipment 12 2.7 2.8 Amortisation of software and licences 13 0.7 0.7 Auditors remuneration audit of these Financial Statements 4 c 0.5 0.6 Auditors remuneration audit of financial statements of subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 4 c 0.3 0.3 Auditors remuneration other services 4 c 0.4 0.4 Operating lease rentals land and buildings head leases 11.8 11.5 Operating lease rentals vehicles 0.3 0.6 Operating lease rentals other 4.2 4.5 Rentals receivable operating leases sub-leases 4.1 4.3 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 0.1 0.2 Realised exchange gains on forward currency contracts 0.9 5.9 Other foreign exchange losses 1.6 4.1 Stated net of amounts receivable from brokers under Commission Sharing Arrangements.

Expenses continued c Auditors remuneration Fees paid to the Groups auditor are summarised as follows: KPMG 2010 2009 m m Annual audit fees 2010 0.5 Annual audit fees 2009 0.4 Annual audit fees 2008 0.2 Audit of these Financial Statements 0.5 0.6 Audit of financial statements of subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 0.3 0.3 Total audit fees of the Group 0.8 0.9 Other services supplied pursuant to such legislation 0.1 0.1 All other services 0.3 0.3 Total auditors remuneration 1.2 1.3 The Groups policy on the award of non-audit services to accountancy firms is outlined in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance.
During the year the fees paid by F&C to other accountancy firms for non-audit services were as follows: 2010 2009 m m Deloitte 1.8 0.3  0.7 0.4 Ernst & Young 0.4 0.4 BDO 0.2 Jebens Mensching 0.1 2.9 1.4 During 2009, in addition to the above, 0.1m was paid to Deloitte for services relating to acquisitions.
These fees were capitalised as part of previous acquisitions.
All acquisition expenses incurred in 2010 were expensed in accordance with IFRS 3 Revised : Business Combinations.
In addition to the above, the following fees were paid by OEICs and unit trusts, for services provided directly to them, for which Group companies are the Authorised Corporate Director or Manager: 2010 2009 m m  0.4 0.5 5.
Employee and member benefit expenses Total employee benefit expenses, including remuneration of the Directors and expenses relating to LLP members, were: 2010 2009 Notes m m Short-term employee and member benefits: Salaries and related benefits 58.7 56.6 Bonus 16.0 15.9 Wages and salaries 74.7 72.5 Distributions to members of LLPs 6.0 TRC Commutation payment to LLP members 1.4 Social Security costs 10.4 11.2 92.5 83.7 Post-employment benefits: Defined contributions pension expenses 25 h 3.9 4.2 Defined benefits scheme income expenses 25 d 1.3 2.6 2.6 6.8 Total of wages and salaries, Social Security costs and post-employment benefits 95.1 90.5 Other long-term employee benefits 0.1 0.1 Termination benefits 1.6 4.6 Share-based payment expenses 26 22.6 20.3 Total employee and member benefits expenses 119.4 115.5 The monthly average number of employees and members including Executive Directors of the Group during 2010 was 1,018 2009: 923.
F&C Asset Management plc had no employees during either year.
The above table includes 6.1m 2009: 6.1m of exceptional employment costs.

Exceptional income and expenditure a Unrealised gains on forward currency contracts 2010 2009 m m Unrealised gains on forward currency contracts 1.2 During 2008, the Group entered into a series of forward currency contracts to provide certainty as to the Sterling value of a portion of the Groups Euro-denominated cash flows.
In line with accounting requirements, open contracts are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at their fair value.
The final contract matured in June 2010 and therefore no unrealised gain or loss has been recognised in the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: 1.2m gain.
Unrealised gains losses on forward currency contracts are excluded from the calculation of underlying earnings.
Realised gains or losses on such contracts are included in determining underlying earnings.
b Other exceptional net operating expenses The Group has classified the following operating expenses income as exceptional: 2010 2009 m m Corporate advisory fees i 9.9 2.6 F&C Partners litigation expense ii 6.0 4.1 TRC Commutation expenses iii 6.2 Exceptional employment and staff related income expense iv 2.5 6.1 F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP income expense v 0.3 3.7 TRC Management Retention and Incentive Plans vi 1.8 TRC integration expenses vii 1.1 Foreign exchange transfer from reserves on liquidation of subsidiary viii 1.3 Investment Trust VAT income ix 2.5 Exceptional client compensation expense x 2.5 Exceptional property expense xi 2.5 20.9 19.0 i Corporate advisory fees During 2010, 7.5m of corporate advisory and related transaction expenses were incurred in connection with the acquisition of TRC, together with 2.0m of abortive acquisition costs in respect of C-Quadrat and other corporate costs of some 0.4m.
The Directors consider these corporate costs to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded this 9.9m aggregate expense from the measurement of underlying earnings.
As noted in the Accounting Policies section of these Financial Statements, the revisions to IFRS 3 Revised : Business Combinations require costs associated with acquisitions to be expensed in the Income Statement rather than included in determining the quantum of any goodwill arising on a transaction.
The 2.6m of costs incurred in 2009 relate to corporate advisory fees incurred in seeking to identify acquisition opportunities which would create shareholder value, together with costs relating to the separation of the F&C Group from FP, prior to FP divesting of its shareholding in F&C.
ii F&C Partners litigation expense As disclosed in the 2009 Financial Statements, the Group has received put option notices under the Partnership Agreement from each of the founder members of F&C Partners LLP Partners, the Groups majority owned fund of hedge funds business.
In addition, there has been further related litigation, details of which are given in note 24.
The Company vigorously denies the validity of these notices and related claims and has been engaged in litigation during the course of 2010 in respect of this matter.
Some 6.0m of associated legal and related expenses have been charged to the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Given the quantum and nature of this expense, the Directors continue to consider it appropriate to treat these costs as exceptional in nature and exclude them from the measurement of underlying earnings.
iii TRC Commutation expenses As outlined in note 15 a, the Divisional Members of TRC Investment Teams have entered into put and call options which, if exercised, will transfer up to 20% of their entitlement to management fee profits to the F&C Group.
Under IFRS, the share element of the consideration payable under these Commutation arrangements requires to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
Given the capital nature of these arrangements, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat the total Commutation expense as exceptional in nature and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2010.

Exceptional income and expenditure continued iv Exceptional employment and staff related income expense During 2010 the Group recognised a net 2.5m of non-recurring income associated with employee remuneration arrangements.
This comprises a 4.0m pension curtailment credit arising from benefit changes made to defined benefit pension arrangements, as outlined in note 25 d, offset by a 0.6m past service pension cost and 0.9m of redundancy and related staff costs, which were incurred as a result of cost saving actions initiated during the year.
The Directors consider the net credit in respect of the above items to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded this credit from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2010.
The exceptional employment costs incurred during 2009 related to a number of actions taken by management to yield recurring staff cost savings.
v F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP income expense 30% of F&C REIT, the Groups property asset management business, is held by the former owners of REIT, two of whom occupy key management roles within F&C REIT.
The former owners have the opportunity to increase their ownership of F&C REIT by a further 10% through the achievement of stretching performance targets over the six year period to 31 December 2014.
This earn-out mechanism meets the criteria of and is accounted for as a share-based payment.
During 2010, as a result of a combination of a reassessment of the likelihood of the financial targets being achieved and the reassessment of the fair value of the F&C REIT business, a credit of 0.3m has been recognised in the Income Statement 2009: a charge of 3.7m.
This credit has been excluded from underlying earnings, as this arrangement is considered to be of a capital nature.
Full details of this share-based payment are given in note 26 c. vi TRC Management Retention and Incentive Plans As a condition of the acquisition of TRC, the Group established a Management Retention Plan MRP and Management Incentive Plan MIP to retain and incentivise certain TRC personnel.
The respective cost of the MRP and MIP including NIC charged to the 2010 Income Statement, for the four month period since the acquisition, is 1.7m and 0.1m.
Details of these share-based payment arrangements are given in notes 26 e and f. Given the quantum and nature of these awards, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat the associated expense as exceptional and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2010. vii TRC integration expenses Following the acquisition of TRC, the Group incurred some 1.1m of integration expenses associated with the alignment of certain activities within the enlarged Group.
This expense includes redundancy related and other integration costs.
Given the nature of this expense, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat it as exceptional in nature and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2010. viii Foreign exchange transfer from reserves on liquidation of subsidiary Following the transfer of its assets under management to another F&C Group company, F&C Luxembourg was put into voluntary liquidation during the year ended 31 December 2010.
The cumulative foreign exchange gain of 1.3m previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve has been recycled to the Income Statement in accordance with accounting requirements.
Due to the nature of this gain, the Directors have excluded this credit from the calculation of underlying earnings for 2010. ix Investment Trust VAT income During 2007, following the outcome of litigation, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC concluded that investment management fees paid by investment trusts were not subject to VAT and a provision was recognised for the VAT and associated interest costs which the Directors considered may be payable to investment trust clients in respect of historic periods, beyond the amounts recoverable from HMRC.
In early 2009, the Group settled all amounts payable in respect of this matter and the excess provision, net of advisor costs, of 2.5m was recognised as a credit in the Income Statement for that year.
The Directors excluded this income from underlying earnings for 2009 to be consistent with the treatment of the expense when the provision was initially recognised.
Details and movements in the associated provision are given in note 24. x Exceptional client compensation expense The exceptional client compensation expense of 2.5m recognised in 2009 represents the net cost to the Group of an amount payable as a result of an investment mandate breach.
This expense related to a single event in respect of one client, attributable to a unique set of circumstances.
Given the scale of the compensation, the Directors considered it appropriate to exclude this cost from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2009.

Exceptional income and expenditure continued xi Exceptional property expense The Group has a number of onerous sub-let properties, which have arisen from historic acquisitions, as the Group has reduced its space requirements for its own operations.
During 2009, the tenant in one of the Groups sub-let premises sought to exercise a break clause in their lease and vacate the premises.
As it was economically beneficial to retain that tenant rather than seek to market the vacant premises, additional lease incentives of some 2.5m were granted to the existing tenant.
Given both the quantum of the increase in this provision and the fact that this lease was acquired as part of an acquisition, the Directors considered it appropriate to exclude the associated exceptional expense from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2009. c F&C REIT put option fair value gain 2010 2009 m m F&C REIT put option fair value gain 6.4 5.6 The fair value of the F&C REIT put option liability, as disclosed in note 28, reflects the value of the F&C REIT business which is currently owned by the minority interest partners and which is the subject of options.
The reduction in the fair value of the options during 2010 of 6.4m has been recognised as a gain in the Income Statement 2009: gain of 5.6m.
The Directors consider the value of these options and movements therein to be of a capital nature, and have therefore excluded these gains from the measurement of underlying earnings.
d Gain on debt exchange 2010 2009 m m Gain on debt exchange 27.9 During 2009 the Group executed a debt exchange programme, as outlined in note 22, which sought to capitalise on the prevailing market conditions.
A net gain of 27.9m arose on the partial extinguishment of subordinated debt, after accounting for the fees and other costs associated with this transaction.
The Directors considered the quantum and nature of this gain to be exceptional and considered it appropriate to exclude this gain from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2009.

Income tax continued c Factors affecting future tax charges The Chancellor of the Exchequers Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK Corporation Tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of 4 years from 2011.
The first reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010 and is effective from 1 April 2011.
Accordingly, this will reduce the Groups current tax charge in future.
This rate change has reduced the net deferred tax liability as at 31 December 2010 by 0.6m.
The reduction comprises three elements: A 0.8m tax charge which has impacted underlying earnings of the Group: A 1.6m tax credit attributable to intangible assets, which has been excluded from underlying earnings, consistent with the treatment of the corresponding amortisation charge: and A 0.2m charge to equity reflecting the deferred tax that is expected to reverse through equity.
A further 1% reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate was announced in the Chancellors Budget of 23 March 2011.
This was subsequently enacted on 29 March 2011 and will take the Corporation Tax rate down to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
It is estimated that the effect of this additional 1% rate change will lead to a further reduction in the Groups net deferred tax liability of 0.6m.
The Directors are of the view that due to the significant level of estimation required it is not yet possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the proposed subsequent 3% rate reduction in future years, although this will further reduce the Groups current tax charge in future and reduce the Groups deferred tax assets liabilities recognised in the Statement of Financial Position.
Earnings per share Basic loss earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the loss earnings for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the earnings for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares at the reporting date.
In the opinion of the Directors the underlying earnings as quantified in the Reconciliation of loss earnings table below, more accurately reflects the underlying earnings performance of the Group.

As a result, the reported basic and diluted loss per Ordinary Share are the same in 2010.
All amounts disclosed in the table above are stated net of any attributable tax, as presented in the Reconciliation of loss earnings table below.

Earnings per share continued Potential future dilution The following share-based payment arrangements could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were not included in the above calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were either anti-dilutive for the years presented or had not met the relevant performance criteria at the reporting date: Long-Term Remuneration Plan restricted awards F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP This earn-out arrangement gives the F&C REIT minority partners the opportunity to increase their ownership of F&C REIT from 30% to 40% before 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2010, the Directors have estimated that the percentage ownership which is expected to transfer is 6.66%.
A transfer of 6.66% would potentially dilute the profits attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
However, the principle of this incentive arrangement is that the incremental profits which would become attributable to minority interests as a result of achieving the performance criteria are funded from the increased level of absolute profits generated by F&C REIT for the year in which vesting arises, rather than diluting the current level of profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
There can be no guarantee that, subsequent to vesting, the higher level of profits which met the vesting criteria would be sustainable.
TRC Management Retention Plan TRC Management Incentive Plan TRC Commutation arrangements The Divisional Members of TRC Investment Teams have put and call options to transfer up to 20% of their entitlement to management fee profits of their respective Investment Teams to F&C.
The exercise of these options is expected to enhance the profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
However, there can be no guarantee that, subsequent to the exercise of the options, a higher level of absolute profits would be sustainable.
Deferred Share Awards Share Save Scheme 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme At 31 December 2010, the 1,082,028 31 December 2009: 1,082,028 options outstanding have all vested.
These have exercise prices between 139.00p and 240.83p and are anti-dilutive as the option prices are above the average share price for the year.
At 31 December 2010, the 236,500 31 December 2009: 532,122 options outstanding have all vested.
These have an exercise price of 455.83p and are anti-dilutive as the option prices are above the average share price for the year.
Details of all awards potentially dilutable at each reporting date are disclosed in note 26, together with the total number of awards outstanding for each scheme.
In addition, the TRC conditional consideration payment as detailed in note 15 a could potentially dilute earnings per share.
Under the acquisition agreement, two potential instalments of up to 10.0m each are payable to the vendors where certain Run-rate EBITDA performance criteria are achieved.
While the achievement of the performance criteria would enhance the level of profits attributable to the equity holders of the parent, there can be no guarantee that the higher level of profits which met the performance criteria would be sustainable.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually at individual CGU level, or when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
The carrying value of goodwill attributable to each CGU was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2010, as described below: to date, none of the CGUs has suffered any impairment of goodwill.
The additional goodwill arising in 2010 relates to the acquisition of TRC and is fully attributable to the newly created TRC operating segment.
Details of the acquisition are given in note 15 a.
Management contracts Management contracts predominantly relate to contracts arising from business acquisitions.
The addition during 2010 of 23.0m is the value attributed to the management contracts acquired through the TRC business combination.
Management contracts are amortised over their expected useful lives and are tested for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
No such indicators have been identified since the last impairment review undertaken as at 31 December 2008 and therefore no impairment review of management contracts has been undertaken this year.
Management contract impairment losses recognised in prior years relate entirely to the F&C operating segment: the accumulated impairment losses at 31 December 2010 were 218.3m 31 December 2009: 218.3m.
The foreign exchange losses in the year arise from the relative weakening of the Euro over the course of 2010, reducing the value of contracts denominated in that currency primarily F&C insurance contracts in Sterling terms.

Intangible assets continued The categories of management contracts, their carrying amounts at the year-end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 31 December 2010 31 December 2009 Remaining Estimated Remaining Estimated Net book amortisation useful Net book amortisation useful values period life values period life m years years m years years RSAI insurance contracts 1.0 1 10 1.7 2 10 RSAI retail contracts F&C OEICs 9.1 1 4 10 13.5 2 5 10 F&C insurance contracts 58.1 4 10 76.2 5 10 F&C institutional contracts fixed term non-fixed term 6.7 4 10 4 17.7 5 1 10 4 F&C investment trust contracts 11.8 5 10 14.0 6 10 F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 19.3 4 10 25.0 5 10 Private equity fund of funds 0.9 14 20 0.9 15 20 REIT property contracts 47.5 57 57.7 67 Thames River Capital contracts 21.1 44 175.5 206.7 Impairment testing of goodwill The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been determined on their value in use including terminal value at each respective testing date for 2009 and 2010.
The value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the Board, and managements forecasts.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows because of the nature of the Groups business making up the CGUs and the Boards current view that there is no reason to believe that they will not continue in operation in perpetuity.
The key assumptions adopted in these calculations for each business segment are as follows: 31 December 2010 31 December 2009 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC Discount rate 8.60% 8.60% 10.60% 10.25% 10.25% n a Long-term market growth rate 5.30% 4.25% 5.80% 5.35% 4.15% n a Inflation rate 4.15% 4.15% 4.15% 4.25% 4.25% n a The costs included in year 1 of the projections reflect those included in the Board approved budget for the respective year.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital to estimate a market relevant rate, calculated as at the year-end, and takes into account the relative risks associated with the Groups various revenue streams included in the respective operating segments.
The discount rates disclosed above are the post-tax rates which have been applied in the projections: the pre-tax discount rates are 10.85% and 13.00% for F&C F&C REIT and TRC respectively 2009: 12.95%, F&C F&C REIT only.
All discount rates shown subsequently within this note are stated after tax.
Revenues are based on the Board-approved budget for each operating segment, and managements net business flow forecasts for the subsequent four years.
Thereafter, revenues have been grown in line with the Groups long-term view of market growth, consistent with that experienced historically, in the long-term, across the markets in which assets are invested.
The different rates reflect the composite mix of assets held in each operating segment for each period.
Net new business revenues are included at the levels assumed in the 2011 budget and managements forecasts up to 2015 with no further net new business included thereafter.
Additional costs associated with the increased revenues have been included in the projections, primarily to reflect variable remuneration costs.
Revenues earned from significant contracts with a fixed term are assumed to terminate at the end of the fixed term, with operating costs falling by an amount which assumes associated profit margins of 70%.
Projected operating costs for the first year are driven by the budgeted profit margins for each operating segment for 2011.
Thereafter, both existing budgeted costs and, as noted above, further costs added associated with net new business revenue forecasts have been grown at inflation rates to accord with anticipated future salary and other cost increases.
Values in use are compared to the carrying values of goodwill, attributable management contracts and other intangible assets net of associated deferred tax provisions, and property, plant and equipment in order to ascertain whether any impairment exists.
As this annual impairment review of goodwill indicated surpluses in all segments, no impairment has been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill 31 December 2009: nil.

Intangible assets continued The key assumptions noted in the above table are those to which the calculated values in use are most sensitive.
These assumptions, together with the inclusion in the projections of forecast net new business revenues and associated costs, result in the following surpluses of goodwill: 31 December 2010 31 December 2009 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC m m m m m m m m m Excess of recoverable amount over carrying value 787.8 44.6 234.9 615.1 74.6 n a In order to assess the sensitivity of the key assumptions on the carrying values of goodwill, an analysis was conducted to ascertain the change that would be required to derive values in use which approximated to the carrying values of goodwill and beyond which impairment would arise.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values in use to the carrying values of goodwill were as follows: 31 December 2010 31 December 2009 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC Discount rate 16.19% 10.36% 39.84% 17.00% 13.35% n a Long-term market growth rate 2.49% 2.85% 5.93 % 2.55% 1.28% n a Inflation rate 7.38% 6.74% 14.21% 7.65% 9.20% n a Per cent.

The fair value of the unquoted investments has been estimated using International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
The Directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the valuation technique applied to unquoted shares which are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position, and the related realised fair value gains recorded in the Income Statement, are reasonable and the most appropriate at the reporting date.
The investments have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
Included within the unquoted financial investments at 31 December 2010 are 0.1m 31 December 2009: 0.1m of equity instruments measured at the price of recent investments.
The fair value of these investments cannot be measured reliably as the Group does not have access to the underlying information to produce fair value valuations for these investments.
These investments consist of loans and carried interest in private equity limited partnerships.
These investments are managed by external fund managers and the Group obtains income when the investments are realised.
The Group intends to hold these investments until all the private equity investments are realised.
In 2010, the Group received no distributions 2009: nil in respect of the investments held at cost.

Acquisition of subsidiaries a Acquisition of Thames River Capital Group F&C Asset Management plc FCAM acquired and gained control of the Thames River Capital Group TRC or the TRC Group on 1 September 2010 Completion date.
TRC is a London-based asset management business that provides specialist products and services to wholesale and wealth management clients.
TRC manages a range of specialist high alpha and absolute return products.
The acquisition of TRC represented an attractive opportunity to broaden F&Cs specialist investment management capabilities in multiple product areas, augment its sales and marketing skills and expand its distribution footprint, thereby accelerating the achievement of F&Cs strategic objectives.
The TRC Group operates its business through two limited liability partnerships LLPs, Thames River Capital LLP and Thames River MultiCapital LLP.
Between them they had 7 Investment Teams at 1 September 2010.
FCAM acquired 100% ownership of Thames River Capital Group Limited which, in turn, owned, directly or indirectly, 100% of the following entities at the date of acquisition: Thames River Capital Holdings Limited Thames River Capital UK Limited TRC UK TRC UKs interest in Thames River Capital LLP TRC UKs interest in Thames River Multi-Capital LLP Thames River Capital GmbH The consideration payable by FCAM for the acquisition will be up to 53.6m excluding the adjustment in respect of the consolidated net assets target comprised as follows: i The initial consideration: 33.6m was paid in cash at Completion: and The consideration paid at Completion will be subject to an adjustment if the consolidated net asset value of the TRC Group at the Completion date exceeds or falls short of an agreed target amount of 9.0m.
ii The conditional consideration payment: Up to a further 20.0m of conditional consideration is payable, in two instalments shortly after 31 December 2011 and 30 June 2012, and is contingent on the TRC Group achieving certain financial targets at each of these dates: The first instalment is a variable amount dependent on the Run-Rate Earnings Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation Run-Rate EBITDA on an annualised basis as at 31 December 2011.
This instalment becomes payable if the December 2011 RunRate EBITDA exceeds 12.5m and the amount payable increases on a straight-line basis from zero to a maximum of 10.0m, which is payable if the December 2011 Run-Rate EBITDA equals or exceeds 15.0m: The second instalment varies according to the Run-Rate EBITDA on an annualised basis as at 30 June 2012.
This instalment becomes payable if the June 2012 Run-Rate EBITDA exceeds 15.0m and the amount payable increases on a straight-line basis from zero to a maximum of 10.0m, which is payable if the June 2012 Run-Rate EBITDA equals or exceeds 17.0m: and The conditional consideration payment, if payable, will be satisfied by the issue of a variable number of Ordinary Shares or, in certain limited circumstances, the issue of bank guaranteed loan notes by F&C.
F&C funded the cash consideration for the acquisition through a combination of the 14.2m net proceeds of a non-pre-emptive cash placing of F&C Ordinary Shares carried out on 28 April 2010, a 15m acquisition loan facility and existing cash resources.
In addition, as a condition of the acquisition, two new share-based payment agreements were established to retain and incentivise TRC group employees: TRC Management Retention Plan and the TRC Management Incentive Plan.
Details of these schemes are disclosed in notes 26 e and f. The fair value of consideration paid by the Group for its 100% holding in Thames River Capital Group Limited was as follows: m Initial consideration cash 33.6 Estimated additional cash consideration payable as a result of TRC net assets exceeding target net assets 7.5 Estimated fair value of first instalment of conditional consideration 5.0 Estimated fair value of second instalment of conditional consideration 2.5 Fair value of consideration paid for 100% of TRC Group 48.6 FCAM also incurred 7.5m of acquisition expenses relating to the legal, accounting and other professional advisor fees associated with the transaction 7.2m of these have been capitalised in the Company Financial Statements, as shown in note 5 on page 133.
These expenses are treated as exceptional costs, as explained in note 6 b.

The following adjustments were made to the book values of the assets and liabilities acquired: The key accounting policy alignment adjustments relate to the recognition of deferred income and deferred acquisition costs, together with associated tax adjustments, in accordance with IFRS requirements adopted by the F&C Group: An intangible asset of 23.0m, together with an associated deferred tax liability of 6.4m, has been recognised on acquisition, being the fair value of the management contracts acquired with TRC.
Further details of intangible assets are given in note 13: and Fair value adjustments include: o the recognition of an investment of 0.8m, being the fair value of F&C Ordinary Shares acquired with TRC, which relate to employee benefit arrangements.
On consolidation, this investment has been transferred to equity as the shares are required to be accounted for as own shares: o a reduction of 0.3m to the initial estimate of employee benefits included in the Completion Accounts: and o the tax effect of pre-tax adjustments.
The adjustments noted above reflect the Directors best estimate of the necessary fair value adjustments to the net assets of the acquired entities as at 31 December 2010.
As at 31 December 2010, the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered by the Directors to be provisional.
Any subsequent amendments to the fair values will be made after the TRC Completion Accounts review process has been completed.
No provisions for reorganisation or restructuring costs were included in the liabilities of the acquired entities.
The net revenues and loss before tax attributable to the TRC Group for the four month period between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2010 were 14.6m and 3.7m respectively.
On an underlying basis excluding the Commutation expense and the costs associated with the TRC Management Retention and Incentive Plans, the pre-tax result was a profit of 2.8m.

Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries continued As a pre-condition of the acquisition agreements, a group restructuring involving the entities being acquired by the F&C Group was completed in advance of the acquisition.
This restructuring was required as the Group was not acquiring Nevsky Holdings Limited or TRC UKs interest in Nevsky Capital LLP, as outlined in the Circular issued to shareholders in respect of this transaction.
As a result, the pre-acquisition results of the acquired entities would have differed materially from the post-acquisition results of TRC entities included within the F&C Group results.
Therefore, it is not considered possible to determine what the F&C Group results would have been had the acquisition completed on 1 January 2010.
The value of goodwill arising on acquisition includes the value of the investment management teams acquired and the value of future business flows that the distribution capability of TRC is expected to generate.
No tax deduction is expected to be available in respect of the goodwill arising on acquisition.
Commutation arrangements The Divisional Members of Investment Teams have entered into put and call options which, if exercised, will transfer value to F&C by way of variation of the entitlements to the allocation of management fee profits as defined in the underlying legal agreements and capital profits in the respective LLP.
The exercise of these options will increase TRC UKs share of the management fee profits of the respective Investment Teams by up to 20%.
These options are exercisable: 18 months after Completion: At the option of the Investment Teams, TRC UK will purchase an additional 10% of the management fee profits of each Investment Team.
The option for Investment Teams to exercise this put option is conditional on that teams respective net fund ows being positive for the 12 months preceding the option exercise period.
36 months after Completion: FCAM has a call option to purchase, through TRC UK, an additional 20% of the management fee profits of each of the Investment Teams.
The level of 20% is reduced by the percentage of any profits which have already been commuted at an earlier date.
The 18 36 months options to acquire such management fee profits may be deferred for a period of 12 months if the F&C EBITDA Multiple, which is one of the components used to quantify the Commutation consideration, is less than 5.
The Commutation consideration may be satisfied in two tranches, at F&Cs sole discretion, by: a the allotment and issue at the relevant Commutation completion date to each Divisional Member of such number of F&C Shares as shall have a value equal to 50% of the consideration, or b the payment to the Divisional Members of 50% of the consideration in cash at the relevant Commutation completion date: and b the allotment and issue at the relevant Commutation completion date to a Nominee of such number of F&C Shares as shall have a value equal to 50% of the consideration Deferred Commutation Shares, or b in certain circumstances the payment of 50% of the consideration in cash on the date falling 24 months after the relevant Commutation completion date.
Deferred Commutation Shares shall be released by the Nominee 24 months after the Commutation completion date, provided the Member continues to provide services to the respective LLP or has ceased to do so in certain good leaver circumstances.
At Completion, two Divisions entered into an initial 10% Commutation, resulting in TRC UK obtaining a further 10% of the related management fee profits in those Investment Teams.
The aggregate consideration payable in respect of this initial Commutation of profits was satisfied by: a cash payment of 1.4m: the issue of 3,042,999 Ordinary Shares and the issue of 3,042,997 Deferred Commutation Shares.
The aggregate fair value of the Ordinary Share capital and share premium arising on the issue of these Shares was 3.8m.
The corresponding charge in respect of these has been recognised in the own share reserve, a separate component of retained earnings, in accordance with the treatment of new shares issued to satisfy share-based payment arrangements.
Under IFRS the share element of these Commutation arrangements requires to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
Further details are given in note 26 g. The cash payment has been expensed and is included within the Commutation expenses outlined in note 6 b iii.
b Acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited Following the review of the Completion Accounts and subsequent fair value adjustments to the purchase consideration for the acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited on 11 October 2004, there is an estimated further consideration of 0.7m payable to Eureko B. V. at 31 December 2010 31 December 2009: 0.7m.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they cannot be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group, and they have arisen in companies that have not reported taxable profits for some time.
Financial instruments a Analysis of assets and liabilities at the reporting date Financial investments held in relation to the activities of the Groups insurance subsidiary have been classified as fair value through profit or loss within current assets.
Stocks of units and shares are held in relation to fund management activities and are classified as held for trading within current assets.
Financial investments included within non-current assets are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value or at amortised cost if fair value cannot be measured reliably.
Other loans and receivables included within non-current assets are carried at amortised cost.

From F&Cs perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management, as the financial risks and rewards attributable to the assets invested fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the Groups clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of this subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact on the level of management fees which are earned from this entity and which are directly affected by the underlying value of policyholder assets.
While F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited has some insurance risks, these risks are fully reinsured, thereby negating any net insurance risk to the Groups equity holders.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table: Securities The fair value of listed investments is based on quoted bid market prices at the reporting date without any deduction for transaction costs.
The fair value of unlisted investments has been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines and in accordance with the underlying limited partnership agreements.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of the Subordinated Notes and Guaranteed Loan Notes is based on a quoted market price at the reporting date.
The fair value of other borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The valuations have considered similar instruments available in the market and the liquidity of assets and liabilities.
Unquoted investments Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market-related rate for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the reporting date.
Put options The fair value is based on an external valuation of the business, as detailed in note 28.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is based on relevant exchange rates at the reporting date.

All short-term deposits are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are not subject to significant risk of changes in value.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short-term deposits are generally made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective shortterm deposit rates.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2010 is 202.2m 31 December 2009: 213.9m.
Restrictions on use of cash The policyholders cash is not available for general use by the Group.
These funds are held on behalf of policyholders of unit-linked insurance contracts which are included in the Statement of Financial Position.
At 31 December 2010 policyholders cash amounted to 23.4m 31 December 2009: 27.7m of the total cash and cash equivalents balance.

This facility was conditional on the acquisition of TRC.
The 15m facility was utilised to partially fund the initial cash consideration for the purchase of TRC and was repaid shortly thereafter following the issue of a further 20m of the existing 9% Guaranteed Fixed Rate Notes in September 2010.
The revolving credit facility is available for drawdown until 31 August 2011, at which point it must be repaid in full.
The repayment date of this facility may be extended until 29 February 2012, at the option of F&C, if certain financial tests continue to be met.
The interest payable on the revolving credit facility is LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.5% and 5.0%, depending on the credit rating and certain financial metrics of the F&C Group.

The remaining terms are for up to 10 years, although a significant element of this provision relates to lease incentive arrangements and is expected to be utilised within 3 years.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases, and the majority of sub-leases, are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
One sub-lease involves the possible receipt of contingent rent.
Any contingent rent received in excess of the anticipated amount is recognised as income during the period.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time, including market rent reviews and break options within the lease arrangements.
In addition, exposure could exist if an existing tenant defaulted or went into liquidation or administration.

Provisions continued NIC on share schemes The provision for national insurance contributions NIC on share schemes represents the potential employers NIC liabilities in respect of a number of share-based payment schemes operated by the Group.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of the extent to which performance conditions are met, movements in the Companys share price, the extent to which awards are forfeited and, where eligible, the timing of when employees choose to exercise options.
The current element of the provision for NIC on share schemes relates to awards which are expected to vest within one year.
At 31 December 2010,2.6m 31 December 2009: 3.1m of financial investments were held by the Group to partially fund the NIC liability on the Deferred Investment Plan and Deferred Investment Option Plan.
This is disclosed in note 18 a i 2.
Long-term sickness The Group has long-term sickness insurance arrangements which cover the cost of absence from work of all current employees.
However, the cost of employees who went on long-term absence prior to these arrangements being established are self-insured by the Group.
The provision represents the expected present value of income protection payments due to these individuals.
This provision has been quantified on the assumption that all employees currently on long-term sick leave do not return to the employment of the Group.
The discount rate and salary growth assumptions used in each year are identical to those used for the purposes of determining UK defined benefit pension obligations.
Guaranteed product The provision for the guaranteed product represents the actuarially assessed cost of meeting potential obligations under certain investment products which have a guaranteed payout in the event of death of the investor.
This provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of movements in market levels and the mortality rates of investors.
The underlying investment plan was closed to new investors during 2004.
Long-term service award This provision represents the obligation in respect of long-term service benefits to which some employees are entitled, including incremental holiday entitlement and long-term service awards.
Investment Trust VAT During 2007, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC agreed that asset management services to UK Investment Trust Companies ITCs should be exempt from VAT.
A number of Group companies, in common with other asset managers in the UK, received claims from ITCs for the repayment of VAT charged to them for historic periods dating back to 1990.
While the Group charged VAT in accordance with applicable UK law at the time, a provision was recognised in 2007 to the extent that the expected payments to be made to ITCs were greater than the expected amount recoverable from HMRC.
In early 2009 all amounts due to ITCs by the Group were settled and the excess of the provision of 2.6m was released to the Income Statement.
No provision is therefore required at 31 December 2009 or 2010.
F&C Partners dispute During 2009, the two individual founder members of F&C Partners LLP Partners, the Groups fund of hedge funds business, sought to exercise put options to sell their minority interest in Partners to the F&C corporate member under the terms of the LLP Agreement in total, for approximately 7.8m.
In March 2009, the F&C corporate member issued a claim in the High Court seeking a declaration on the validity of the exercise of the put options.
The individual members sought an unspecified sum by way of counter-claim.
In June 2009, the individual founder members issued a petition against Partners and the F&C corporate member under Section 459 of the Companies Act 1985 now Section 994 of the Companies Act 2006 seeking an order that the F&C corporate member buy out their minority interest in Partners at a price to be determined.
In April 2010, the F&C corporate member issued a cross-petition against the individual members and Partners under section 994 of the Companies Act 2006 seeking an order that the individual members transfer their interests in Partners to the corporate member at a valuation based on the market value of Partners.
These matters have been heard at a trial in the High Court which commenced in June 2010 and is scheduled to conclude shortly, although the outcome of this trial is not expected to be known until later this year.
There are a number of potential outcomes to this trial including an order that the F&C corporate member buy out the minorities interest and there is a wide range of values at which such an order could be made.
In view of this uncertainty, and having regard to the formulaic value which may have been determined had the founder members validly exercised their put options in October 2010, the Directors continue to hold a provision of 2.4m at 31 December 2010, in respect of the totality of all disputed matters, even though they have been advised that the Group should be successful in respect of all claims.
The provision was initially recognised in 2009.

Pension benefits The Group operates defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and participates in one in Portugal.
The UK scheme is closed to new entrants.
All new UK employees are eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements, which provide greater certainty over the future cost to the Group.
A former Chairman of the Group, Mr R W Jenkins, has a pension entitlement of 119,000 per annum, commencing in January 2011.
This pension will be indexed in line with the Retail Price Index on 1 January in each subsequent year.
The Group has not earmarked any assets to date with respect to this liability.
The net pension deficit is recognised under non-current liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position and is stated gross of the related deferred tax asset.
The results of the latest full actuarial valuations were updated at 31 December 2010 by qualified independent actuaries.

Pension benefits continued Basis used to determine the expected rate of return on plan assets To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the actual asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
b Major assumptions used by schemes actuaries in respect of benefit obligations i Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used for the main UK defined benefit scheme and the unfunded UK obligation are: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 Mortality table for males retiring in the future S1NML MC min1% 1 PMA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for females retiring in the future S1NFL MC min1% 1 PFA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for current male pensioners S1NML MC min1% 1 PMA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for current female pensioners S1NFL MC min1% 1 PFA92MCYOB 1 The mortality assumptions for the overseas schemes are: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 F&C Netherlands Prognosetafel 2010 2060 generational table Prognosetafel 2008 2053 generational table F&C Ireland Compulsory Purchase Annuity Rates Compulsory Purchase Annuity Rates F&C Portugal Males TV 73 77 rated down 1 year Males TV 73 77 rated down 1 year Females TV 88 90 rated down 2 years Females TV 88 90 rated down 2 years ii Impact of mortality assumptions To demonstrate what these mortality assumptions mean in respect of the FCAM Plan, the expected ages at death of members retiring at age 60 are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 Years Years Expected age at death for a male retiring in the future at age 60, currently aged 40 90 89 Expected age at death for a female retiring in the future at age 60, currently aged 40 92 92 Expected age at death for a current male pensioner aged 60 89 88 Expected age at death for a current female pensioner aged 60 90 91 iii Cost of annuities The table below summarises the cost of providing annuities of 1 per annum with associated death benefits and pension increases for UK members currently aged 40 at age 60 based on the assumptions used for the pension disclosures: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 Male annuity 25.60 24.30 Female annuity 25.00 24.00 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 5.30% 2009: 5.70%.
The rates also assume two-thirds of the members benefit will be paid to the spouse: a 5-year guarantee is provided: and pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension will increase by 3.35% 2009: 3.60% per annum.
iv Discount and growth assumptions The range of assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 Discount rate 5.30% 5.50% 5.70% Rate of salary increase 2.00% 4.00% 2.50% 4.85% Rate of inflation increase 2.00% 3.50% 2.00% 3.60% Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 15841 F&C Annual Report MIDDLE:Layout 1 06 04 2011 15:37 Page 85 F&C Asset Management Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Statements 85 25.

# The Board and Trustees implemented changes to the UK FCAM Pension Plan during 2010.
The changes capped future increases in pensionable salary for past and future service.
These changes resulted in a one-off credit to the Income Statement.
The curtailment income has been recognised as an exceptional item within exceptional employment and staff related income expenses see note 6 b.
For future service the changes increased the normal pension age unless additional employee contributions were paid and reduced the level of pension increases applied.

Trustee Board of the FCAM Plan The appointment of Trustees is determined by the FCAM Plans trust documentation.
The Trustee Board currently consists of three employerappointed Trustees, three member-selected Trustees and two independent Trustees, one of whom is currently the Chairman of the Trustee Board.
Of the current employer-appointed and member-selected Trustees, four are employees of F&C and active members of the FCAM Plan, one is a deferred member and one is retired and receiving a pension from the FCAM Plan.
Relationship between F&C and the Trustees of the FCAM Plan The FCAM Plans assets are held in a separate Trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustees of the FCAM Plan are required to act in the best interests of the FCAM Plans beneficiaries.
ii Other pension schemes F&C Portugal Certain employees in Portugal participate in the multi-employer scheme, Fundo fide Pensoes do Grupo Banco Comercial Portugus.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are separately identifiable.
There are no Trustees, and F&C Portugal controls the assets relating to the F&C members of the scheme.
From 1 January 2011, this scheme will be integrated into the Social Security system and part of the employees occupational pension benefits will be funded through the Social Security system from that date.
However, the scheme benefit structure and employees total pensions have not changed.
F&C Netherlands The Plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
There are no Trustees, but the Works Council participates in negotiations in respect of potential changes to the Plan.
F&C Ireland The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Ireland.
There are currently four Trustees of this plan, all of whom are employees of F&C.

Pension benefits continued f Future funding requirements FCAM Plan A revised schedule of contributions was agreed in January 2011, under which the Group agreed to pay a minimum of 17.0% of Pensionable Salaries plus 3.0m per annum in respect of deficit recovery contributions, 0.48m per annum in respect of administrative expenses and any additional amounts required as a result of the asset underperformance guarantee.
Further, to the extent that the Group repays any amount of its fixed or floating rate notes after 1 January 2011 from cash flows then the Group shall pay, within one month of that repayment, a special contribution to reduce the deficit determined in the valuation at 31 March 2010 in the same proportion as the aggregate reduction in fixed or floating rate notes.
If there is more than one such reduction then the special contributions necessary shall be computed taking into account the aggregate percentage reduction in fixed or floating rate notes since 1 January 2011 and the amount of any previous such special contribution paid.
For the avoidance of doubt, a repayment from cash flows does not include a repayment of the notes from the issue of a capital instrument specified for that purpose.
The minimum estimated contribution expected to be paid into the Plan during 2011 is 5.2m 2010: 7.4m.
Prior to this the Group paid contributions in line with, or in excess of, those required by previous schedules agreed in June 2008 and March 2010.
Under these previous schedules the Group paid contributions of a minimum of 29.6% of Pensionable Salaries until 1 March 2009 and 28.1% of Pensionable Salaries thereafter.
The Group also agreed to pay an additional 1.5m per annum from 1 April 2007 but in fact paid 5.0m per annum between 1 July 2009 until the completion of the 31 March 2010 triennial actuarial valuation.
Employee contributions are payable via a salary sacrifice scheme in addition to the Group contributions.
The rates of employee contributions payable increased on a phased basis until March 2009 and some were further increased from 1 March 2010 as described below.
Contributions are subject to review at future actuarial valuations.
As the FCAM Plan is a closed scheme, under the projected unit method the current service cost will tend to increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as the average age of members increases.
With effect from 1 March 2010 changes were made to the benefits granted under the FCAM Plan in respect of both past and future service for current active members.
A limit of 2% per annum was imposed on future increases in Pensionable Salary.
To facilitate this, an underpin was introduced so that members benefits accrued prior to 1 March 2010 will not be less than that they would have received if they had left service on 28 February 2010.
In addition, in respect of service after 28 February 2010 only, the level of guaranteed increases in pension after retirement was reduced and some members were given a choice between increasing the level of their contributions or having their normal pension age increased to 65.
These changes reduced the pension cost recognised in the Income Statement in 2010 when the effect of the changes on past service had been recognised, and will, to a lesser extent, reduce the pension cost in subsequent years.
Non-UK schemes The figures in the table below assume that contributions will continue to be paid to the overseas schemes at the level paid in 2010, with appropriate increases for future changes in salary assumptions.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes Amounts paid into the Groups defined benefit schemes in the past two years and expected future payments over the next five years are as follows: Contributions paid m 2009 6.6 2010 9.0 Expected future contributions m 2011 6.2 2012 6.0 2013 6.0 2014 6.0 2015 6.1 g Risk management i FCAM Plan The Trustees set general investment policy but delegate the responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the investment manager.
The Trustees regularly monitor the FCAM Plans investments.
The Trustees seek advice from their investment advisor and believe they have sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustees have set performance and risk targets for the investment manager.
The performance objectives are long-term.
However, the Trustees monitor the investment manager on a regular basis in order to ensure that the scheme is on track to meet its long-term objectives.

Pension benefits continued The results of an asset-liability review undertaken alongside the 31 March 2010 actuarial valuation of the Plan will be used to assist the Trustees and the Group in managing volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a significant increase in the FCAM Plans deficit by providing information used to determine the FCAM Plans investment strategy.
Asset allocation The Trustees, with the agreement of F&C, decided to introduce more diversification into the FCAM Plans return-seeking asset investment strategy.
At the present time, diversifying allocations to both UK and overseas equity-linked bond funds and an overseas private equity fund have been made.
Previously the Trustees have implemented a Liability Driven Investment LDI approach to the investment strategy.
Other allocations to alternative asset classes may be made in the future.
Interest rate and inflation risk The LDI pools are intended to help provide a degree of matching to the liabilities of the FCAM Plan.
Each pool comprises zero coupon derivatives with the same maturity as the expected cash flows of the scheme.
Each pool has leveraged exposure of varying amounts to inflation and interest rates.
The pools are valued using the market values of the underlying securities.
The equity-linked bond funds also provide a degree of matching to the liabilities but in addition retain an exposure to equity market movements.
Currency risk In order to increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the FCAM Plan invests in overseas assets.
However, the FCAM Plans liabilities are denominated entirely in Sterling and therefore there is a risk that the appreciation of Sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas assets.
Operational risk The investment managers do not directly hold any of the FCAM Plans securities.
These are held by an external custodian.
The assets are ring fenced from F&Cs creditors and are therefore transferable.
ii Non-UK schemes The plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
The value of the plan assets is the value of the reserve which the insurance company holds to match guaranteed pension liabilities.
These reserves are, in effect, fixed interest instruments, so provide a reasonable match to pension liabilities.
The plan in Ireland invests in pooled unitised funds, with returns reflecting the performance of the underlying assets.
The plan in Portugal is part of an industry-wide banking sector plan.
Each participant company holds a share of the assets, which are invested using the same asset allocation as the overall plan assets.
F&C Portugal is the asset manager for the overall scheme.
At 31 December 2010, the assets of both the F&C Portugal and F&C Ireland plans were invested in diversified portfolios that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities.

Details of option pricing models and key assumptions used to obtain the fair value of services received, or the fair value of the equity instruments granted, have been disclosed only for awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2010.
Details of awards granted in previous accounting periods are disclosed in the previous years Financial Statements.
The fair value of services received in return for awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The cash-settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
Once the share awards vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employee in cash.
The value of dividend payments has been separated from the equity-settled awards as these are settled in cash.
The cumulative grant expense for each award is trued up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period, after allowing for actual forfeitures and, where applicable, the extent to which the performance criteria have been met.
The weighted average share price during 2010 was 0.64 2009: 0.73.
The weighted average share price at exercise date during 2010 was 0.65 2009: 0.77.

Full term of award Immediate to 60 months.
Fair value of options at award date 24.0m Expected forfeiture 0.0% Model used Intrinsic value based on method of determination of the Commutation consideration in accordance with the Commutation agreement.
The consideration is based on a multiple of Investment Team management fee EBITDA for a period of 12 months preceding the option exercise.
The multiple is based on a 25% discount to F&Cs own enterprise value to EBITDA trading multiple, which will be calculated by dividing F&Cs enterprise value by the F&C EBITDA.
The F&C enterprise value to EBITDA trading multiple is subject to a maximum of 12.
The F&C enterprise value is based on an average F&C share price multiplied by the total number of F&C shares allotted.
a The Long-Term Remuneration Plan LTRP The LTRP is the primary long-term incentive arrangement of the Group.
The LTRP rules allow both Deferred Share Awards and Restricted Share Awards to be made at the discretion of the Board.
i Deferred Share Awards The LTRP allows deferred awards to be granted to employees below Executive Director level, subject only to a time-vesting period of three years.
The number of Deferred Share Awards is as follows: 2010 2009 No.

Share-based payments continued ii Restricted Share Awards New performance conditions were introduced for the restricted LTRP awards granted in 2010.
Vesting of the Ordinary Shares that are the subject of a Restricted Share Award under the LTRP will now be dependent upon four specified performance conditions and conditions of continued service being met.
The performance conditions applied to the LTRP are determined by the Board, are measured over a three-year performance period and comprise the following: 25% of the award comprises an underlying Earnings Per Share EPS condition: 25% of the award comprises a Total Shareholder Return TSR condition: 25% of the award comprises an Investment Performance condition: and 25% of the award comprises a Net New Business condition.
To the extent that any element of the award has not vested in accordance with the performance criteria detailed below it lapses immediately.
a The EPS element The EPS condition is based on the amount by which the average annual percentage growth in underlying EPS exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index condition over the three-year performance period EPS Outperformance Percentage.
The awards vest according to the following criteria: EPS Outperformance Percentage Percentage of award vesting Less than 3% 0% 3% 25% Equal to or greater than 11% 100% Between 3% and 11% Straight-line vesting between 25% and 100% b The TSR element The TSR condition compares the TSR of the Group over a three-year performance period commencing on the award date with a list of companies in a predetermined financial services comparator group.
At the end of the performance period, the Group and each of the comparator companies are listed and ranked in accordance with their TSR over the performance period TSR Position.
The TSR measure reflects the movement in the value of shares plus any dividends declared during the relevant period.
The awards vest according to the following criteria: TSR Position Percentage of award vesting Below median 0% Median 25% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Straight-line vesting between 25% and 100% c The Investment Performance element The Investment Performance condition is based on the Total Weighted Outperformance Percentage 25% of the one-year outperformance percentage and 75% of the three-year outperformance percentage on investment management performance over a three-year period.
The awards vest according to the following criteria: Total Weighted Outperformance Percentage Percentage of award vesting Equal to or less than 42% 0% 75% or more 100% Between 42% and 75% Straight-line vesting between 0% and 100% d The Net New Business element The Net New Business condition is based on a comparison of the actual versus the budgeted amount of net new business for the period Net New Business Percentage.
The budgeted net new business is determined on an annual basis by the Board.
Performance is measured over a three-year period.
The awards vest according to the following criteria: Net New Business Percentage Percentage of award vesting Equal to or less than 25% 0% 125% or more 100% Between 25% and 125% Straight-line vesting between 0% and 100% Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 15841 F&C Annual Report MIDDLE:Layout 1 06 04 2011 15:37 Page 94 94 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements F&C Asset Management 26.
Share-based payments continued The number of Restricted Share Awards is as follows: 2010 2009 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 327,548 843,829 Granted during the year 3,786,486 Expired during the year 327,548 516,281 Outstanding at 31 December 3,786,486 327,548 The EPS and TSR elements of the awards granted on 16 March 2007 did not meet the respective performance criteria and expired.
At 31 December 2010 the following LTRP restricted share awards were outstanding: No.

b The Executive Director Remuneration Plan EDRP Any Executive Director of the Company is eligible to participate in the EDRP.
The EDRP provides for the grant of two different forms of award, Deferred Share Awards and Restricted Share Awards.
i Deferred Share Awards Awards vest at the end of a three-year period from grant date, subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no performance criteria attached to the deferred shares and the vested shares transfer to the participant as soon as possible after vesting.
Outstanding at 1 January 4,715,206 2,526,214 Granted during the year 2,188,992 Exercised during the year 1,500,574 Outstanding at 31 December 3,214,632 4,715,206 No awards were exercisable at either 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009.
At 31 December 2010 the following EDRP Deferred Share Awards were outstanding: No.
of awards Earliest Exercise Grant date outstanding exercise date price 25 March 2008 1,025,640 25 March 2011 0.0p 8 July 2009 2,188,992 8 July 2012 0.0p The awards outstanding at 31 December 2010 have a weighted average outstanding term of 1.1 years 31 December 2009: 1.6 years.
ii Restricted Share Awards The vesting of the Restricted Share Awards is dependent on the satisfaction of predetermined performance conditions relating to the underlying Earnings Per Share underlying EPS performance of the Group.
Under this condition, the Restricted Share Awards granted on 27 May 2007 would only vest if the Groups underlying EPS equalled or exceeded the 18.1p underlying EPS target for the year ending 31 December 2009.
As the 2007 Restricted Share Awards did not meet this criteria they have now expired.
The number of Restricted Share Awards is as follows: 3 years 3.5 years 2010 2009 2010 2009 No.
# Outstanding at 1 January 2,002,000 2,002,000 2,002,000 2,002,000 Expired during the year 2,002,000 2,002,000 # Outstanding at 31 December 2,002,000 2,002,000 # This represents the maximum number of restricted shares which could have been achieved by the participants.

Share-based payments continued c F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP In accordance with the F&C REIT Partnership Agreement, the F&C REIT minority partners Kendray Properties Limited, Leo No and Ivor Smith have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT Asset Management LLP F&C REIT collectively from 30% to 40%.
A variable minority interest was granted as an incentive to achieve increased levels of profit including realisation of future performance fees in return for a potential increased stake in the business.
This variable minority interest is therefore accounted for under IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
The fair value of the award at date of acquisition reflects the value assessed as part of the acquisition valuation.
The fair value of the award is reassessed at each reporting date and this fair value is spread over the relevant vesting period.
The minority partners have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT by 3.33% for every year in which the EBITDA performance target of 45.0m is achieved, up to a maximum of 10%.
For example, if the target was achieved in the first three years, no further increase would be possible.
The variable minority interest performance criteria could be achieved in any year of the six-year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2014.
The vesting period is uncertain but the maximum timescale to achieve full vesting for each 3.33% is in years 4, 5 and 6 respectively.
At 31 December 2010 the Directors have assumed that 3.33% will vest in each of 2013 and 2014 and the first tranche will expire as the performance target is not expected to be achieved.
The expense for the second and third tranches is being spread from the date of grant 3 September 2008 over 5 and 6 years respectively.
However, the respective vesting period may be accelerated if the targets are achieved earlier.
If either Leo No or Ivor Smith should leave during this period, the variable minority interest could still convert to all the minority partners, so the remaining charge would be accelerated, subject to meeting the performance criteria.
The additional minority interest to which the minority partners would be entitled will be in proportion to their original partnership interest at the date of vesting.
If a partner left after one year he would sacrifice two-thirds of his interest.
If a partner stays three years he is entitled to his proportionate share of the full 10%, subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Kendrays minority interest always varies in accordance with the underlying interests of Leo No and Ivor Smith.
Any variable minority interest sacrificed by a minority partner will remain part of FCAM plcs share of F&C REIT.
As the performance criteria is non-market based, to the extent that part or all of the performance criteria are not met then that proportion of the charge will be reversed, i. e. trued up.
d F&C REIT Long-Term Remuneration Plan F&C REIT LTRP During 2010, a new scheme has been introduced to incentivise F&C REIT employees.
There are two elements to the Plan: i Deferred Award with no performance conditions: and ii Restricted Awards with performance conditions.
Participants are awarded notional units in the F&C REIT Asset Management LLP Group F&C REIT LLP, each equal to 0.00005% of the market value of the F&C REIT LLP.
The market value of the F&C REIT LLP will be determined annually by an independent valuation.
The Deferred Awards vest at the end of a pre-determined period from grant date normally three years, subject to the continued employment of the participant.
On vesting, the awards are settled by a cash payment based on the market value of each unit at the end of the vesting period.
No Restricted Awards have been granted under the performance element of this Plan to date.
The number of F&C REIT LTRP Deferred Awards is as follows: 2010 2009 Units Units Outstanding at 1 January Granted during the year 28,859.60 Outstanding at 31 December 28,859.60 At 31 December 2010 the following F&C REIT LTRP Deferred Awards were outstanding: No.

Share-based payments continued e Thames River Capital Management Retention Plan TRC MRP The TRC MRP was one of the two new share plans established at the date of the TRC acquisition to retain and incentivise key professionals within the TRC Group.
Awards of deferred shares vest three years after completion of the acquisition, subject to continued employment within the F&C Group or membership of one of the two TRC LLPs.
The TRC MRP awards are not subject to any performance criteria.
The TRC MRP includes good and bad leaver provisions.
The number of TRC MRP awards is as follows: 2010 2009 No.

f Thames River Capital Management Incentive Plan TRC MIP The TRC MIP is the second of two plans established at the date of the TRC acquisition to further incentivise TRC employees and members of the two TRC LLPs in the six-year period from the date of acquisition Completion.
Awards under the TRC MIP will vest upon achievements of specified financial targets as follows: 12.5% of the shares subject to awards will vest on the date falling thirty months following Completion provided that the run-rate EBITDA of the TRC Group as at 31 December 2011 is 15.0m or more.
If the run-rate EBITDA is 12.5m or less, none of this tranche of shares will vest and the number of the shares that vest will increase on a linear basis if the run-rate EBITDA falls between the two thresholds: 12.5% of the shares subject to awards will vest on the third anniversary of Completion provided that the run-rate EBITDA of the TRC Group as at 30 June 2012 is 17.0m or more.
If the run-rate EBITDA is 15.0m or less, none of this tranche of shares will vest and the number of the shares that vest will increase on a linear basis if the run-rate EBITDA falls between the two thresholds: and The remaining 75.0% of the shares subject to awards will vest in two equal instalments on each of the fifth and sixth anniversaries of Completion provided that the cumulative EBITDA of the TRC Group for the four-year period to 31 March 2014 is equal to 100.0m or more.
If the cumulative EBITDA is equal to 60.0m or less, none of this tranche of shares will vest and the number of the shares that vest will increase on a linear basis if the run-rate EBITDA falls between these two thresholds.
Vesting is subject in each case to continued employment within the F&C Group or membership of the relevant LLP as the case may be.
The terms of the TRC MIP includes good and bad leaver provisions, change of control provisions and a cash-settled element.
In addition, participants in the TRC MIP will receive an additional cash payment up to a maximum aggregate amount of 3.0m, payable at the time that shares are delivered and in proportion to the number of shares which vest.
The number of TRC MIP awards is as follows: 2010 2009 No.

Share-based payments continued g Thames River Capital Commutation arrangements TRC Commutation arrangements Note 15 a outlines the key aspects of the Commutation arrangements which were established at the date of the acquisition of TRC by the F&C Group.
Under these arrangements, the Divisional Members of TRC Investment Teams entered into put and call options, which if exercised will transfer up to 20% of their entitlement to management fee profits to the F&C Group.
The members of the LLPs are considered to be providing services to the Group and as a result, the share element of the Commutation consideration is required to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
It is the intention of the Directors to settle these awards in equity and therefore they have been treated as equity-settled awards.
The maximum payable under Commutation arrangements is 81.4m and F&C has authority to issue a maximum of 122,511,485 shares to settle the consideration payable on exercise of the options.
The options are re-measured at intrinsic value at each reporting date and the total expense is spread over the respective vesting period.
The options are considered to be non-market performance conditions if the options are not exercised, then there is no charge to the Income Statement.

Additionally, 1.4m of cash was paid to an Investment Team.
No Commutation options were exercisable at 31 December 2010. h Purchased Equity Plan PEP i F&C Asset Management plc shares The PEP operates in conjunction with the discretionary bonus scheme and is intended to encourage shareholding by management and employees of the Group by providing for: The compulsory purchase of shares using annual bonus above a threshold level: and Voluntary purchase of shares using annual bonus, with associated Matching Shares.
No Voluntary Purchased Equity awards have been granted.
At the Boards discretion, eligible employees who are awarded in a financial year an aggregate bonus in excess of a threshold level of 100,000 2009: 100,000 may be required to defer one-third of the element exceeding 100,000 2009: 100,000 into shares comprising either a range of investment products managed by the Group or the Companys shares Compulsory PEP for three years.
The Compulsory PEP will not benefit from any form of matching award and is subject to forfeiture in the event that the employee leaves the Group for any reason other than as a good leaver in the three-year retention period.
The number of Compulsory PEP share awards is as follows: 2010 2009 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 1,396,860 1,975,594 Granted during the year 493,810 213,761 Exercised during the year 1,105,055 792,495 Forfeited during the year 1,888 Outstanding at 31 December 783,727 1,396,860 Exercisable at 31 December 13,145 41,044 The awards exercisable at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 relate to good leavers.

The awards outstanding at 31 December 2010 have a weighted average outstanding term of 1.8 years 31 December 2009: 0.6 years.
ii F&C Investment Funds At the discretion of the Board, the cash bonus may be deferred on a mandatory basis into certain F&C Funds Compulsory Purchased Equity subject to continued service over either three or four years.
This option is available as an alternative to the Compulsory PEP into FCAM plc shares.
The main benefit of this arrangement is to incentivise fund managers to invest in the funds they manage, thereby further aligning employee interests with those of clients.
The settlement of awards from the Compulsory PEP F&C Investment Funds is made by realisation of the holding in the fund at the vesting date and purchase of FCAM plc shares at that date.
The value of the investment in F&C Funds, the FCAM plc share price and hence the ultimate number of FCAM plc shares to be settled is only known with certainty at the vesting date.
Any dividends paid by F&C Funds during the vesting period are re-invested in F&C Investment Funds.
The awards meet the criteria of IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
However, as the awards are ultimately settled in FCAM plc shares, it is not considered possible to reliably estimate the fair value of these awards at the grant date.
This is due to the number of market-based criteria which ultimately combine to determine the number and value of FCAM plc shares settled.
Settlement of these awards to employees is satisfied by the purchase of FCAM plc shares in the market.
The fair value of these awards at the year end has been determined by measurement of the equity instruments at intrinsic value, being the quoted price of the relevant F&C Funds, both at the grant date and at each subsequent reporting date.
The intrinsic value is then spread over the vesting period.
The value of the services provided is measured using the ultimate value of awards which vest.
The 2009 awards were invested into a total of 14 eligible F&C Investment Funds, comprising OEICs and Investment Trusts.
The underlying investments are held within an Employee Benefit Trust.

j Share Save Scheme The Share Save Scheme is an all-employee share scheme which was activated in March 2003.
The options granted entitle the holders to acquire Ordinary Shares, whether by subscription or purchase, at a price per Ordinary Share determined by the Directors prior to the issue of invitations.
The price at which options are offered cannot be less than 80% of the middle-market quotation of an Ordinary Share at the date of grant.
No cash alternative is available.
As part of the application process, participants are required to enter into a savings contract with a savings provider presently Yorkshire Building Society, and agree to make 36 in the case of a 3-year savings contract or 60 in the case of a 5-year contract monthly savings contributions of a fixed amount.
At the end of the savings contract, participants may choose to apply for repayment of their savings contributions, in addition to a tax free bonus.
An option may only be exercised once and normally only during the period of six months after the date on which the participants first become entitled to repayment of their savings contributions plus bonus.
The option will generally lapse after a period of six months following the end of the savings contract.
Employees who are deemed good leavers are entitled to exercise their options, for which they have accrued savings to date, for a period of up to six months after they leave.

The estimate of the fair value of options granted is measured based on a binomial model.
The contractual life of the option 3.5 or 5.5 years is used as an input to this model.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the model.
k 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme The 2002 Executive Share Option scheme 2002 ESOS was activated in March 2003.
The vesting period for each award was three years and options are settled by an allotment of shares to individuals.
All options under the 2002 ESOS have now vested, as the performance criteria have been met.
The options expire if they remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of award.

l 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme IFRS 2: Share-based Payment is only applied to grants of shares, share options or other equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and had not vested before 1 January 2005 i. e. the effective date of IFRS 2.
The 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS last granted options before 7 November 2002 and is not therefore subject to the full effects of IFRS 2 in terms of recognising an expense in the Income Statement.
The standard does, however, require certain disclosures to be made in respect of this scheme.
The 1995 ESOS is an unapproved share option scheme, in which participation was entirely at the discretion of the Directors.
The lifespan of the scheme was ten years from the date on which it was approved by shareholders and accordingly no further options could be granted under the scheme after 1 September 2005.
The vesting period was three years and all remaining options are exercisable.
Options are settled by grant of shares to individuals.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group.

The above liability reflects the fair value of unrealised losses on open contracts at the reporting date, based on observable foreign exchange rates.
The F&C REIT put options represent the fair value of the potential future liability to purchase the 30% interest in F&C REIT currently held by the minority interest partners in this business.
The REIT parties have the right to require F&C to acquire all or part of their membership interests in F&C REIT at a valuation determined by an independent valuer, subject to an overall cap on F&Cs liability of 100.0 million.
Ivor Smiths option is exercisable after the third anniversary of Completion and Leo Nos option is exercisable after the seventh anniversary of Completion.
While Kendray Properties Limited does not have any direct right to require F&C to acquire its holding in F&C REIT, under the terms of the Partnership Agreement Kendray cannot hold a greater interest in F&C REIT than the aggregate of Leo Nos and Ivor Smiths interests or the holder of their beneficial interests and is therefore effectively required to transfer an element of its holding such that this requirement is achieved.
The consideration for such a transfer would be fair value.
Hence, in determining the gross liability of the option, Kendray Properties Limiteds entire holding in F&C REIT has been included.
The reduction in the fair value of the F&C REIT put option liabilities of 6.4m during 2010 2009: 5.6m reduction has been released to the Income Statement as detailed in note 6 c. An external valuation of the F&C REIT business was performed at each reporting date to enable a fair value to be placed on the F&C REIT put option liabilities.
The average of three valuation methodologies equally weighted was used to place a fair value on the F&C REIT business, namely: 1.
Market earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA multiple 3.
Fixed EBITDA multiple The main assumptions used in the valuation methodologies are: a Projections of the profit and loss for F&C REIT: Net new business: Based on the F&C REIT approved budget for year one, with management forecast projections for the subsequent few years Revenue growth: 1.5% 7.0% per annum Cost inflation: 3.5% per annum b Discount rates: 12.5% on recurring cash flows 25.0% on non-recurring cash flows c Perpetuity growth rates: 3.0% for recurring cash flows 3.0% for non-recurring cash flows d Earnings multipliers: 9.0 x recurring EBITDA 3.0 x non-recurring EBITDA Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 15841 F&C Annual Report MIDDLE:Layout 1 06 04 2011 15:37 Page 102 102 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements F&C Asset Management 29.
Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of policyholder investments at the start and end of the year and an analysis of movements during the year are as follows: 2010 2009 Note m m Liability as at 1 January 649.9 753.1 Contributions received 66.4 67.5 Investment return applied 3 74.3 136.0 Charges levied 3.1 3.4 Repayments 229.2 303.2 Movement in contingency reserve 0.2 0.1 Movement in reinsurance ceded 1.1 Liability as at 31 December 559.2 649.9 All investment contract liabilities have been disclosed as current liabilities as this is considered to be appropriate to the rights of policyholders who may withdraw their investments at short notice.
The Directors expect that the majority of the investment contract liabilities will be repayable outwith one year.
Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contract liabilities include life assurance liabilities in respect of lifetime guarantees provided with certain investment products, and annuity liabilities in respect of pension investment contracts where the investor has retired.
These liabilities and related reinsurance balances at the start and end of the year, together with an analysis of movements in the year, are as follows: 2010 2009 Gross Reinsurance Net Gross Reinsurance Net m m m m m m At 1 January 1.9 1.9 2.1 2.1 Claims paid 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Change in economic assumptions 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Unwinding of discount rate 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Other changes in year 0.1 0.1 At 31 December 2.0 2.0 1.9 1.9 The reinsurance liabilities relate to annuity business reinsured with Friends Provident Pensions Limited.
A liability adequacy test was carried out at policy level and resulted in no additional provision for either 2010 or 2009.
No significant gain or loss arose on reinsurance contracts incepted in 2010 or 2009.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used in determining the insurance contract liabilities and the reinsurers share of these liabilities, and the process adopted to arrive at these assumptions are as follows: Mortality rates 2010 2009 Annuities in payment 8293% PCXA00 8194% PCXA00 Due to the small number of annuity policies, the mortality assumptions reflect recent experience of the reinsurer together with an allowance for future mortality improvement.
Experience analysis for mortality is performed annually by the reinsurer.
Discount rate The discount rate used at 31 December 2010 is 4.81% 31 December 2009: 5.21% based on current fixed interest gross redemption yields, with a prudent adjustment for risk.

Reserves The analysis of movements in reserves is disclosed within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 44.
Nature and purpose of reserves: Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the issue of share capital in excess of par value.
Capital Redemption reserve The Capital Redemption reserve is used to maintain the capital of the Company when shares are bought back and subsequently cancelled without Court Approval.
Merger reserve The merger reserve is used to record share premium on shares issued by way of consideration in respect of acquisitions.
The element of the merger reserve which relates to amortisation and impairment of intangible assets charged to the Income Statement is considered to be realised.
A transfer is made from the merger reserve to retained earnings to recognise the extent to which the merger reserve has been realised, thereby offsetting the corresponding element of the intangible amortisation and any impairment charge.
Other reserves: Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and non-Sterling denominated intangible assets.
Fair value reserve This reserve records fair value changes on available for sale investments until the investments are derecognised.
Acquisition reserve The acquisition reserve was created on the initial recognition of the F&C REIT minority interest put option liabilities.
Retained earnings Retained earnings comprises: Net profits and losses recognised through the Income Statement: Dividend distributions to equity holders: Actuarial gains and losses recognised on pension obligations: Deferred tax on actuarial gains and losses: Transactions relating to equity-settled share-based payments, and deferred tax movements on share-based payments reflected through equity: The purchase and sale of own shares: and Transfers from merger reserve.
Minority interests This reserve represents the share of the Groups net assets which are not attributable to equity holders of the parent, including the minority interests share of intangible assets arising from business combinations and subsequent amortisation thereof.

Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to a number of business risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Groups risk management arrangements, but has delegated the implementation and operation of the Board policies to management.
The Groups risk management policies and the risk management framework for identifying, monitoring and managing risks across the Group, including strategic and operational risks, are outlined in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance on pages 30 to 31.
The Directors consider it appropriate to differentiate between those financial risks which directly impact the Group and those which indirectly impact the Group due to the risks borne by our clients and the consequential impact on the Groups assets under management and revenues.
The Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial instruments arises from the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note presents information on the Groups direct or indirect exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
Note 37 provides numerical analysis of the Groups financial instrument exposure to such risks, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at the reporting date.
Indirect earnings risk through client assets As an active fund manager, the Group is responsible for managing assets in accordance with the mandates specified by our clients.
The assets managed by the Group are subject to varying financial risks market, credit and liquidity.
While these risks could result in financial loss or gain through a change in asset value, these risks and rewards are fully borne by, or fall to the benefit of, our clients.
However, as the majority of the Groups revenues are quantified as a percentage of assets under management generally on a quarterly, monthly or daily basis, the Groups income is impacted by movements in client assets which are caused by the exposure to financial risks.
As a result of the direct link of revenues to the value of client assets, the Groups interests are aligned to those of our clients.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 15841 F&C Annual Report MIDDLE:Layout 1 06 04 2011 15:37 Page 107 F&C Asset Management Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Statements 107 36.
Financial risk management continued A key risk to our business is that of poor investment performance, which could lead to the subsequent loss of client mandates.
A key role of the Heads of F&Cs investment functions is to monitor the fund performance achieved by our investment professionals.
Where it is considered necessary, actions are taken to change process or personnel with a view to attaining top quartile performance.
The Group has the ability to earn performance fees from a number of our clients, where out-performance of the benchmark or set objective is achieved.
These arrangements reinforce the alignment of the Groups interests with those of our clients.
The key components of financial risk to which our clients are exposed are: Market risk the risk of financial loss arising from changes in the market prices of assets.
Market risks include exposure to all asset classes, including equities, fixed income products and property as well as currency risk and interest rate risk.
Credit risk the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations in respect of assets held within client portfolios.
Credit risk can vary by asset class and individual instrument.
Liquidity risk the risk of financial loss to client portfolios because a counterparty does not have sufficient financial resources available and is unable to realise assets in order to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only realise assets by suffering financial loss.
Direct earnings and capital exposure The Group has direct exposure to the following risks in respect of financial instruments on the Statement of Financial Position: Market risk the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Credit risk the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations in respect of financial instruments held by the Group.
Credit risk includes investment credit risk, counterparty risk, deposit and loan risks and country risk.
Liquidity risk the risk of the Group failing to maintain adequate levels of financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Group could be required to pay its liabilities earlier than expected or because of any inability to realise assets in order to meet obligations as they fall due or is only able to realise assets by suffering financial loss.
A fuller analysis of the financial risks associated with the Groups financial instruments, together with the objectives, policies and processes to manage the Groups exposure to those risks follows.
Unit-linked assets and liabilities A significant element of the value of the Groups financial assets relates to the Groups unit-linked pooled pension entity, F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited F&C MPF.
As outlined in note 18, Financial Instruments, the risks and rewards associated with these assets, which are held by F&C MPF, fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the underlying policyholders.
As a result, the investment contract liabilities included in the Statement of Financial Position are equal and opposite in value to the assets which are held on behalf of unit-linked policyholders.
The Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default, although the revenue stream earned from managing these assets varies in line with the movement in assets held on behalf of clients.
The financial risk management disclosures specifically exclude policyholders unit-linked assets and liabilities relating to F&C MPF as there is no direct exposure to the Group from the associated financial instruments.
Financial investments Recognising that the Groups revenue stream has significant financial exposure to fluctuations in assets managed on behalf of clients, a key principle of the Group Treasury Policy set by the Board is to restrict investment of the Groups assets to low risk deposits or money market instruments where the risk of capital loss is low, thereby seeking to protect the Groups capital.
Advance Board approval is required for any investment or financial instrument which does not follow this general principle.
During 2008, following significant strengthening of the Euro against Sterling, the Groups reporting currency, the Group entered into a series of forward currency contracts to provide greater certainty over the Sterling value of some of the expected future Euro-denominated revenue streams.
The final contract matured in June 2010.
The Board recognises that the Group continues to have significant exposure to Eurodenominated cash flows, but at this point in time has not chosen to enter into any further medium-term forward exchange contracts.
During 2010 the Group recognised 0.9m of a realised gain in respect of the final forward currency contract.
This gain represented the partial reversal of the 1.3m of net unrealised loss recognised in prior periods.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group had no remaining medium-term forward currency contracts in place, but held short-term contracts, to a gross value of less than 1.0m, which were specifically matched to foreign currency assets at the year end.
Financial investments classified as available for sale, as detailed in note 14, primarily reflect the value of the Groups private equity investments.
These represent carried interest entitlement which arises from the Groups historical ownership of private equity businesses.
The Board does not seek to manage any of the financial risks associated with these investments and recognises that uncertainty exists as to the quantum and timing of future distributions which may arise from these investments.

Financial risk management continued Other financial investments, classified as fair value through profit or loss, as detailed in note 18 a i 2, primarily comprise assets held in connection with current or historic employee remuneration arrangements.
The Group has no net financial exposure to Purchased Equity Plan, Bonus investments and TRC Employee Benefits assets as the risks and rewards of all movements in the value of these financial assets fall to the beneficiary and are offset by equal and opposite movements in the Groups associated employee benefit liabilities, which accrue over the vesting period.
The NIC hedge economically hedges the Groups exposure to movements in future national insurance contributions obligations in respect of certain assets.
Stock of units and shares The Group operates and manages a number of OEICs whose funds, into which retail and institutional investors can invest, have a wide range of investment objectives.
The Group holds a stock of units and shares in these OEIC funds in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Groups risk management policy limits the aggregate value of the units held by the Group to 1.25m, thereby capping the maximum financial risk exposure associated with these assets.
Trade debtors and accrued income Trade debtors and accrued income represent amounts recognised within net revenue in the Income Statement, but which have not been settled in cash.
The nature of F&Cs business is such that asset management fees accrue based on daily, month-end or quarter-end asset values which, once known, are billed to clients and are due to be settled in line with individual contractual terms.
As a result, the aggregate value of debtors and accrued income can represent up to four months of revenue at any point in time.
In addition, as most of the performance fees earned by the Group accrue in respect of the calendar year and can only be billed subsequently, the quantum of accrued income recognised in the Statement of Financial Position at the reporting date is generally higher than at other points during the year and is sensitive to the magnitude of performance fees earned.
Before the Group takes on new clients, it undertakes the required Know Your Client procedures.
As the Group manages assets on behalf of clients and management fees are typically charged to and paid from the underlying funds managed by the Group, there is a relatively low risk of default on management fees.
The Group does not hold any credit insurance.
Due to the scale of some of F&Cs larger clients, the Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk from large clients or groups of connected clients, arising from timing difference between the recognition of income and the receipt of management fees outlined above.
Very few clients have an external credit rating.
Where management fees are denominated in a currency other than Sterling, the Group is exposed to currency risk.
As noted earlier, the Group no longer hedges any significant element of its exposure to monetary assets denominated in foreign currency.
OEIC and unit trust debtors OEIC and unit trust debtors include Trustee debtors and Debtors due from investors in respect of the purchase of units.
Typically, the Group recognises OEIC and unit trust creditors of a similar magnitude at any point in time.
In operating and managing OEICs, the Group seeks to match the purchase and sale of investments to align to the receipt or payment of funds from or to investors.
However, if these obligations are not matched then there is a requirement for the Group to fund any shortfall from its corporate cash resources.
The risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved.
In the event that investors default on sums due, then the Group is entitled to reimbursement of costs from the investor.
Cash and cash equivalents F&C adopts a low risk approach to treasury management and seeks to ensure that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed appropriately.
The Group treasury operations are managed by the Finance function within parameters defined by the Board.
The regulatory capital and treasury position of the Group are reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The Groups cash and cash equivalent assets are exposed to a number of financial risks in the normal course of its business.
The policy adopted is designed to manage risk and recognises that treasury management operations are specifically not treated as a profit centre.
The key aspects of this policy and its implementation are detailed below: Funds on deposit will only be placed on a short-term basis maximum term 90 days to help maximise regulatory capital.
Deposits may only be placed with counterparties approved by the F&C Credit Committee, and the Board has set a 25.0m limit for the maximum exposure to any single counterparty.
The F&C Credit Committees primary focus is to assess the credit position of counterparties prior to placing any client assets with them and to monitor credit risk thereafter.
Exposure to cash and cash equivalent balances held in foreign currency is managed to reduce the risk of movements in exchange rates, where possible, by the repatriation of surplus foreign currency into Sterling.
This is achieved in practice via the regular settlement of the Groups transfer pricing arrangements and through the payment of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, having regard to their respective, legal, regulatory and working capital requirements.
Cash and deposit balances can be exposed to interest rate movements.
The Group utilises the experience and skills of its professional dealing team to obtain the best interest rates, ensuring the expected maturity dates of deposits are aligned to the Groups working capital requirements.

Financial risk management continued Any exception to the treasury policy requires the prior approval of the Board.
Recognising the consequences of the recent global financial crisis, management sought to operate throughout 2010 with a maximum corporate exposure to any one financial institution of 15.0m.
Prior approval was required for a limited number of exceptions.
Reinsurance assets The Groups unit-linked pooled pension subsidiary is an insurance company and has some exposure to insurance contract liabilities, as outlined in note 30.
These liabilities are fully reinsured as the Group seeks to have no net insurance exposure.
The reinsurance assets represent the expected amounts recoverable to meet insurance liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has exposure to both credit and liquidity risk on these assets.
Defined benefit pension deficit The Groups defined benefit pension deficit represents the discounted value of future pension obligations in excess of plan assets, details of which are given in note 25.
The Group has exposure to the movements in the market value of the plan assets, which include equities and LDI fixed interest pools.
Approximately 25% of the assets held in respect of the UK scheme are held in LDI pools, with maturity profiles which match the expected maturity profile of pension obligations.
The market values of the LDI pools are impacted by movements in interest rates.
The value of defined benefit pension obligations is quantified and discounted using corporate bond rates.
Movements in these rates can have a significant impact on the pension liabilities and hence the quantum of the Groups pension deficit.
Management of capital While F&C considers its capital to be its total equity, this is effectively managed via the net assets to which it relates.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Board monitors significant movements in the composition of its shareholder base.
Details of substantial interests in share capital are shown in the Report of the Directors on page 23.
In the ordinary course of business the only movements in the absolute number of shares in issue would be through the issue of new or own shares to satisfy obligations under sharebased payment arrangements or through the purchase of own shares to satisfy future share scheme obligations.
The Directors give careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for financing all acquisitions, which historically have included both equity and debt funded transactions.
During 2010 some 24.8m new shares were placed in the market to partially fund the TRC acquisition and some 6.1m of new shares were issued in respect of the Commutation arrangements.
Dividends are only declared by the Board after due consideration of a number of key items, including the financial results and the outlook of the financial position of the Company and of the Group.
The dividend policy seeks to achieve a targeted dividend cover of 1.5 times underlying profit.
Following the re-basing of the interim dividend for 2010, the Board declared a total dividend of 3.0 pence per share for 2010.
This resulted in the 2010 dividend cover on an underlying basis being in excess of the 150% target, in respect of dividends declared for 2010.
The overall objective of shareholder liquidity risk management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity over short and medium time horizons to meet the needs of the business.
This includes liquidity to cover, among other things, capital expenditure, servicing debt and equity capital as well as working capital to fund the Groups day-to-day operational requirements.
At the time of announcing the interim dividend for 2010, the Board indicated that it will seek to reduce net debt over the medium-term, with a target of zero net debt to be achieved by the end of 2014.
While the Board consider this target to be achievable, the Directors recognise that a number of risks exist which could prevent this target from being achieved.
Working capital Working capital is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that settlement terms of all forthcoming liabilities can be met.
This activity includes timely collection of debtors and monitoring of cash on deposit, having regard to regulatory capital requirements, as outlined below.
The Groups Finance function includes a Treasury team which manages the cash flow requirements of the Group while seeking to maximise the amount of cash on deposit.
The Group has a 20m revolving credit facility and bank overdraft facilities available to it which provide some protection against any short-term cash-flow deficiencies.
The undrawn committed facilities available at the reporting date are shown in note 22 as are details of the Groups interest bearing loans and borrowings.
During 2010 the Group issued 20m of additional 9% guaranteed fixed rate loan notes to refinance the remaining 10m of debt used to partially finance the REIT acquisition in 2008 and raised 10m to partially fund the TRC acquisition.
In total, the Group now has some 150m of 9% guaranteed fixed-rate loan notes which mature in December 2016.
The Group continues to have some 125m of subordinated notes in issue.
The earliest repayment date for these notes is 2016, but this can be extended at the option of the Group to 2026.
In addition, the Group has the option to defer interest payments on this debt, but if it elects to do so then no dividend can be paid to Ordinary Shareholders until the cumulative amount of any unpaid interest due on the subordinated debt is settled in full.
No such interest payments have been deferred.
The Board Reserved List prohibits the use of derivatives including futures, options and forward contracts, in respect of the Groups net assets, without prior Board approval, recognising the general principle of seeking to minimise capital loss.

Financial risk management continued Regulatory capital requirements The Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital in accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
In 2006, the Group obtained from the FSA a waiver from meeting any minimum capital requirements under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
This waiver took effect from 1 January 2007 and was due to expire at the end of 2011, however, the FSA has recently approved F&Cs application to renew the waiver, meaning it now does not expire until April 2016.
During 2010, the waiver was extended to include the acquired Thames River entities.
At 31 December 2010, there were 16 regulated companies in the Group, of which 12 are registered in the United Kingdom and are subject to regulation by the FSA.
This includes F&C MPF which, being a regulated insurance firm, as opposed to an investment firm, is not part of the consolidation Group for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
Overseas regulated companies, registered in the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Hong Kong are subject to regulatory capital requirements set out by their respective local regulatory authority, as embedded within the legislation of those jurisdictions.
Regulations set out the measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resources Requirements CRR to determine the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
This CRR is referred to as the Pillar 1 capital requirements under CRD.
For the UK regulated investment firms, the CRR is the higher of: The sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement: and The fixed overhead requirement.
Credit risk represents the risk of a party being unable to meet its obligations to a firm and is calculated using risk weighted percentages applied to the various exposure amounts.
The market risk for F&C represents the risk of loss from fluctuations in exchange rates and is calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overhead requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firms relevant fixed annual expenditure in the previous years audited Financial Statements.
The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FSA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Groups regulated companies are required to submit financial returns monthly, quarterly or semi-annually and the Group must submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
The CRD requires the Group to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that companies have adequate capital to enable them to manage risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing key risks, considering how the company would cope with a significant market downturn for example, and an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
All of the Groups regulated entities maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout 2010.

The extent of risks arising from financial instruments Note 36 presents details of the Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial risks arising from financial instruments and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
This note provides numerical analyses of the Groups direct exposure to such financial risk, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at each reporting date.
The disclosures in this note exclude any policyholder unit-linked assets and liabilities in respect of F&C MPF, as the risks and rewards rest primarily with the policyholders.
a Credit risk i Maximum exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The maximum exposure of each class of financial asset is: 31 December 31 December 2010 2009 m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 9.9 10.0 Stock of units and shares 0.1 0.3 Available for sale financial assets: Financial investments 3.5 2.2 Loans and receivables: Trade debtors 21.5 14.9 Accrued income 38.9 41.3 OEIC and unit trust debtors 81.2 21.8 Other debtors 10.8 8.5 Amounts owed by Eureko Group 1.4 1.4 Amounts owed by TRC related party entities 0.7 Amounts owned by F&C REIT related party entities 0.1 0.1 Cash and cash equivalents shareholders 178.8 186.2 346.9 286.7 The accrued income balance is higher than the average monthly balance during the year.
This is primarily due to the level of performance fees recognised at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
The quantum of OEIC and unit trust debtors at 31 December 2010 is higher than the average monthly balance during the year.
However, this is dependent upon the level of creations and liquidations of units or shares and the monetary value of each transaction.

This analysis measures the change in fair value and cash flows of the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis, which is for illustrative purposes only, is prepared based on financial instruments at the reporting dates.
The sensitivity assumes changes in certain market conditions.
These assumptions may differ materially from the actual outturn due to the inherent uncertainties in global financial markets.
In practice, market risks rarely change in isolation and are likely to be interdependent.
The methods and assumptions used are the same for both reporting periods.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on the impact a set percentage increase or decrease in the market conditions would have on the profit or loss and on total equity.
Changes in exchange rates assume an instantaneous increase or decrease of 10.0% for foreign currency to Sterling rates at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes in fair values of investments assume a 10.0% increase or decrease in the fair values of investments at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
Changes in market interest rates assume an increase or decrease of 1.0% in the rate applied to average cash balances in the year.

In addition, the F&C REIT put options are disclosed in note 28 at fair value.
A 10% movement in the fair value of the options at 31 December 2010 would result in a 5.4m 31 December 2009: 6.0m charge or credit to the Income Statement and to equity.
Impairment of financial assets can also be affected by changes in the relevant underlying risk.
