Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2010.

Net debt is calculated as gross debt, as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.
2010 2009 2008 $m $m $m External borrowings 2,281.2 1,396.1 1,030.0 Less cash and cash equivalents 338.3 252.2 450.3 Net debt 1,942.9 1,143.9 579.7 Equity 3,868.9 2,431.0 1,893.9 Net debt ratio 50% 47% 31% The movement from 2009 is attributable to higher external borrowings during 2010, principally as a result of the Groups $2,630 million investment in development, appraisal and exploration activities which is offset by an increase in equity attributable to the equity raise in January 2010.
Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2010 was as follows: US$ Euro Stg Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 224.5 5.7 18.7 12.0 260.9 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 74.8 0.4 0.3 1.9 77.4 Fixed rate debt 386.4 158.4 544.8 Floating rate debt 1,655.0 1,655.0 1,742.1 6.1 139.4 13.9 1,861.5 The profile at 31 December 2009 for comparison purposes was as follows: US$ Euro Stg Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 34.4 1.0 194.9 9.7 240.0 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 11.4 0.8 12.2 Fixed rate debt 544.8 544.8 Floating rate debt 58.9 710.9 769.8 24.5 1.0 1,049.4 10.5 1,062.4 The profile at 31 December 2008 for comparison purposes was as follows: US$ Euro Stg Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash at bank at floating interest rate 80.7 1.8 347.7 13.7 443.9 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 5.8 0.6 6.4 Fixed rate debt 50.0 50.0 Floating rate debt 962.9 962.9 80.7 1.8 659.4 14.3 562.6 Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR and sterling LIBOR.

Financial liabilities continued The $2.5 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at sterling or US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 December 2015, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
The $650 million Revolving Credit Facility is repayable in full on 31 December 2011.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
At the end of December 2010, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $685 million: $175 million under the $2.5 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility and $510 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
At the end of December 2009, the headroom under the two facilities was $620 million: $370 million under the $2 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility and $250 million under the Revolving Corporate Facility.
The Group is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Group hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and interest rate caps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2010 is $13.6 million out of the money 2009: $8.9 million out of the money, 2008: $3.0 million out of the money.
The interest rate hedges are included in the fixed rate debt in 2010, in the above table, and also included in the fixed rate debt in 2009 and 2008.
Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in sterling UK and US dollars all other countries, the operating currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also denominated in sterling and US dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
These exposures are managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives, typically to manage exposures arising on corporate transactions such as acquisitions and disposals.
There were no foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2010 year end.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2010, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were 106.0 million $164.0 million cash drawings under the Groups borrowing facilities.
As at 31 December 2009, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were $1,337 million cash drawings under Groups borrowing facilities.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of $164.0 million 2009: net liabilities of $1,337 million.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the US dollar.
The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including 20% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
The sensitivity analyses include only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates.
As at 31 December 2010, a 20% increase in foreign exchange rates against the functional currencies of entities in the Group would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $27.3 million 2009: $226.7 million and a 20% decrease in foreign exchange rates against the functional currencies of entities in the Group would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $32.8 million 2009: $339.9 million.
Liquidity risk The Group manages the liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by maintaining debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups portfolio of producing fields and delays in development projects.
The Group normally seeks to ensure that it has a minimum ongoing capacity of $500 million for a period of at least 12 months to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
The major assumption in current cash flow forecasts is that the receipt of disposal proceeds from the Uganda farm-down, which has been delayed longer than expected, will now be received in Q2 2011.
On this basis, the Groups forecasts, taking into account reasonably possible changes as described above, show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have very significant financial headroom for the 12 months from the date of the 2010 Annual Report and Accounts.
However, in the unlikely event that the Ugandan farm-down process is delayed beyond Q2 2011, the Directors are confident that the Group can manage its financial affairs, including the securing of additional funding, agreement with existing lenders, portfolio management and deferring of non-essential capital expenditure, so as to ensure that sufficient funding remains available for the next 12 months.
After taking account of the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.

The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
