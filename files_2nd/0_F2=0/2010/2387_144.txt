Taxation continued Reconciliation of the effective tax rate The following table provides a reconciliation of the UK statutory corporation tax rate to the effective tax rate of the group on profit or loss before taxation.
For 2010, the items presented in the reconciliation are distorted as a result of the overall tax credit for the year and the loss before taxation.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and for the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in isolation.
