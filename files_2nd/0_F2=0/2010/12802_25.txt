Interest rate swaps The Group has taken out various interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as follows: Punch Taverns Finance plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A3 N, Class B3, Class M2 N and Class D1 floating rate notes to a fixed rate of 5.954%.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
Punch Taverns Finance B Limited Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A8 and Class C notes to a fixed rate of 5.1% and 4.7577% respectively.
Although the Class A8 swap ensures that cash flows are perfectly hedged over the life of the notes, it was deemed ineffective as at 22 August 2009 due to the intention to purchase and cancel a portion of these notes ahead of their expected legal maturity.
com 21 Financial liabilities continued Spirit Issuer plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.581% to March 2012 and 6.831% thereafter on the Class A1 and Class A2 debenture notes and, after their respective step-up dates, 4.529% on the Class A3, Class A4 and Class A5 debenture notes.
Although these swaps ensure that cash flows are perfectly hedged over the life of the notes they were deemed ineffective at the time of acquisition of the Spirit group, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39, and accordingly all future movements in fair value will be recognised in the income statement.
After taking account of the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities are as set out below.

During the period, the Group redeemed all remaining bonds nominal value of 192.1m.
The share price at the date of pricing of the convertible bonds in the market was 8.60.
The fair values of the liability component and equity component were determined at issuance of the bonds.
The fair value of the liability component was calculated using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The residual amount, representing the value of the equity conversion component, was included in shareholders equity as a separate reserve.
The value of convertible bonds recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: m Liability component at 23 August 2008 264.8 Finance cost note 5 19.5 Cash interest paid 11.8 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 1.3 Redeemed 80.3 Liability component at 22 August 2009 193.5 Finance cost note 5 2.2 Cash interest paid 3.0 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 0.2 Redeemed 192.9 Liability component at 21 August 2010 Finance cost on the bonds was calculated using the effective interest method by applying the effective interest rate of 9.23% August 2009: 9.23%.
Maturity of Group debt The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups debt at 21 August 2010 and 22 August 2009 based on contractual, undiscounted cash flows including interest.

All derivative financial instruments are held on the balance sheet at fair value: the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments, that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivative financial instruments, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and credit risk.
There is no material currency exposure as all material transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The Group has no material exposure to equity securities or commodity price risk and it is the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised on pages 22 to 25.
Interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest bearing assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
Income and cash flows from cash and cash equivalents fluctuate with interest rates.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds and loan notes.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging, where this is financially practicable, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
As at the year end, the Group held 44.1m of floating rate notes for which interest swaps remain outstanding.
The Group has taken out derivative financial instruments such that 100% of all loans at 21 August 2010 August 2009: 100% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements thereby largely eliminating the Groups exposure to changes in interest rates.
87 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 21 August 2010 continued 22 Financial instruments continued Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
If the interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during the period, the effect on the income statement would be as follows: Movement in fair value of interest Interest Interest rate receivable payable swaps Period ended 21 August 2010 m m m Impact on income statement if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 2.9 61.5 Impact on income statement if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 2.9 71.8 Impact on equity if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 110.8 Impact on equity if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 130.7 Period ended 22 August 2009 Impact on income statement if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 2.7 76.8 Impact on income statement if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 2.2 76.8 Impact on equity if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 110.8 Impact on equity if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 110.8 Whilst cash flow interest rate risk is largely eliminated, the use of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk such that the Group would not benefit from falls in interest rates and would be exposed to unplanned costs, such as breakage costs, should debt or derivative financial instruments be restructured or repaid early.
Liquidity risk The Groups funding strategy is to ensure a mix of financing methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
The Group is primarily financed by secured loan notes, with approximately 90% August 2009: 91% of the capital balance on these loan notes being repayable after more than five years from the balance sheet date, subject to relevant covenants being met.
The Board continues to review alternative sources of finance.
The Groups objective is to smooth the debt maturity profile and to arrange funding ahead of requirements where required so maturing short term debt may be refinanced or paid as it falls due.
Cash flow forecasts are frequently produced to assist management in identifying liquidity requirements and are stress tested for possible scenarios.
This includes assessments of the ability to meet the restricted payment conditions in the three securitisation structures in order that cash can be released to the top company level.
Should any securitisations not meet the restricted payment conditions, then cash generated may under certain circumstances become trapped within the securitisation not made available to the wider group to naturally fide-lever that securitisation.
Cash balances are invested in short term deposits such that they are readily available to settle short term liabilities or to fund capital additions.
In the prior period pressure on the Groups revenue, profit, cash flows and overall liquidity from the general UK consumer environment made it necessary for the Group to take steps to improve the capital structure of the Group, to increase cash flow and repay debt in advance of maturity dates.
For these reasons, the Group announced a Firm Placing and Placing and Open Offer on 15 June 2009.
The Firm Placing and Placing and Open Offer completed in July 2009 raising net funds of 353.6m.
These funds were used to facilitate the repayment of the Groups convertible bonds and for the repurchase of securitisation notes at a discount to par if appropriate opportunities arose and to provide additional support to the securitisation groups as necessary to assist the Group in providing covenant headroom.
Capital risk The Groups capital structure is made up of net debt, issued share capital and reserves.
These are managed effectively to minimise the Groups cost of capital, to add value to shareholders and to service debt obligations, ultimately ensuring that the Group continues as a going concern.
The Groups debt is divided into three separate securitisations.
The securitised debt is monitored by a variety of measures, which are reported to the debt providers on a quarterly basis.
The Group assesses the performance of the business, the level of available funds and the short to medium strategic plans concerning capital spend as well as the need to meet financial covenants and such assessment influences the level of dividends payable.
com 22 Financial instruments continued Credit risk With the exception of cash and short term deposits invested with banks and financial institutions, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk by ensuring that surplus funds are invested with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings and that the Group deals with third parties that have been subject to credit checks, or that have good credit scores, where appropriate.
Trade and other receivables, as shown on the Consolidated balance sheet, comprise a large number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers and are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts.
Management estimates the provision for doubtful debts based on a review of all individual receivable accounts, experience and known factors at the balance sheet date, taking into account any collateral held in the form of cash deposits, which is quantified.
These cash deposits are applied against unpaid debt when licensees leave the pubs, and vary in size.
The amount of cash deposits held at 21 August 2010 is 33.2m August 2009: 37.2m.
These are held on the balance sheet within trade and other payables.
Receivables are written off against the doubtful debt provision when management deems the debt no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables for doubtful debts is shown below: 21 August 22 August 2010 2009 m m Provision for doubtful debts at beginning of period 7.4 8.1 Charged to income statement 5.6 8.0 Utilised during the period 5.9 9.6 Released during the period 1.8 Provision for doubtful debts at end of period 5.3 6.5 The ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date, net of the doubtful debt provision, is as follows: 21 August 22 August 2010 2009 m m Live debt Current 32.3 51.2 0 35 days past due 1.1 1.8 Over 35 days past due 5.5 5.4 Closed debt 0.1 39.0 58.4 Live debt represents balances outstanding from current licensees.
Closed debt relates to outstanding balances from customers that are no longer current licensees of the Group.
There are no indicators at 21 August 2010 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the net amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments The carrying values of derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet are as follows: Group 21 August 2010 Current Non-current Current Non-current assets assets liabilities liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps 57.9 349.2 Group 22 August 2009 Current Non-current Current Non-current assets assets liabilities liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps 2.7 67.7 231.0 89 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 21 August 2010 continued 22 Financial instruments continued The interest rate swaps replace the LIBOR rate on the Groups secured floating rate loan notes and bank loans with a fixed rate.
The capital amount of the swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the associated notes over their life see note 21 for more detail.
Of the total carrying value of the interest rate swaps 247.6m August 2009: 170.3m qualify as, and are treated as, cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39 and movements in their fair values are recognised directly in equity.
The remaining 159.5m August 2009: 125.7m do not qualify for hedge accounting with movements in their fair value being recognised in the income statement.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Groups secured loan notes and convertible bonds, there are no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups secured loan notes at 21 August 2010 is 3,558.2m August 2009: 4,054.5m and the fair value, measured at market value, of this debt at that date is 2,863.6m August 2009: 3,397.4m.
The carrying value of the liability element of the convertible bonds is nil at 21 August 2010 August 2009: 193.5m and the fair value of the whole instrument, measured at the listed market value, of these bonds at 21 August 2010 is nil August 2009: 198.0m.
Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a level 2 valuation method.

All of these schemes are equity-settled schemes.
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity-settled awards after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Discretionary Share Plan The first scheme is a Discretionary Share Plan DSP whereby options are granted to senior management over ordinary shares in the Company, at the prevailing market price at time of grant.
These options vest after a three year performance period, with performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee, and are then exercisable for a period of between seven and ten years.
Performance targets for options granted on 31 January 2006 and 16 November 2005 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 10% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted on 17 November 2004 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 12% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted on 2 March 2004 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 12% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 15% per annum.
No options have been granted under this scheme since 31 January 2006.
Long Term Incentive Plan The second scheme is a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP whereby senior management will receive conditional rights over ordinary shares in the Company.
Eligible employees are awarded rights to the issue of a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made are satisfied.
Further information on the performance conditions of the Long Term Incentive Plan are shown in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 40 to 51.
At 21 August 2010 eligible employees held rights over ordinary shares that may result in the issue of 34,493 shares on 10 September 2010, 836,525 shares on 22 January 2011, 22,804 shares on 12 May 2011, 299,954 shares on 7 July 2011, 3,972,972 shares on 10 November 2011, 59,090 shares on 11 May 2012 and 7,009,856 shares on 16 October 2012 and 484,209 shares on 1 June 2013.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The third scheme is a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSB whereby senior management receive part of their post-tax annual bonus in shares.
These shares are held on behalf of the senior management in a trust and if certain performance and eligibility conditions are met then a further award of shares is made after three years.
At 21 August 2010, 58,379 shares are held within the trust and eligible employees hold additional rights over ordinary shares that may result in the future issue of up to 26,763 shares on 12 November 2010.
Share Bonus Plan The fourth scheme is a Share Bonus Plan SBP whereby, at the discretion of the Board, certain employees of the Group, who are eligible for an annual bonus, are entitled to participate.
Eligible employees are awarded rights to the issue of a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a two year period, which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period if the eligibility condition set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made is satisfied.
At 21 August 2010, eligible employees held rights over ordinary shares that may result in the issue of 104,144 shares on 10 November 2010.
Share Incentive Plan The fifth scheme is a Share Incentive Plan SIP open to all eligible employees, whereby proceeds contributed by employees are used to buy shares in the Company at prevailing market values.
These shares are called partnership shares and are held in a trust on behalf of the employee.
For every partnership share bought by the employee the Company will give the employee one share free of charge matching share.
The employees have to take their shares out of the plan on leaving the Group and will not be entitled to the matching share if they leave within three years of buying the partnership shares.
If the Company awards dividends to its shareholders, the employee will receive a dividend on each of the partnership and matching shares they hold.
The Company arranges for the dividends to be used to buy extra shares dividend shares.
Dividend shares must be held in the plan for three years before they can be removed unless the employee leaves the Group in which case they must be taken out.
The scheme was introduced in June 2004 with shares being acquired at market values on an annual or monthly basis.
As at 21 August 2010 1,585,892 shares August 2009: 1,064,832 shares had been issued by the Company to the trust at par value.
The par value of the shares issued that has been deducted from reserves is negligible.
The market value of these shares at 21 August 2010 was 2.0m August 2009: 1.1m.
Fair value of share awards The fair value is measured using the valuation technique that is considered to be the most appropriate to value each class of award.
Discretionary Share Plan There were no awards made in relation to the Discretionary Share Plan during the current or the previous period.

The expected term of the options is based on the life to the point of expected exercise.
This is determined through analysis of historically evidenced exercise patterns of option holders.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
Share Incentive Plan The fair value of the matching shares issued under the Companys Share Incentive Plan is recognised as the market value of the shares issued at the date of purchase.
This charge is spread over the three year vesting period on a straight line basis.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan There were no awards made in relation to the Deferred Share Bonus Plan during the current or the previous period.

In July 2010 the Government announced a proposal to replace the Retail Price Index RPI with the Consumer Price Index CPI for pension increases in the private sector on the basis that the CPI is a more appropriate measure of the change in cost of living for pensioners than RPI.
The Group is currently in the process of seeking legal advice on how this change might impact the benefits payable under the three defined benefit pension schemes.
The impact of changing from RPI to CPI is likely to result in a reduction in the present value of scheme liabilities.

The pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 21 August 22 August 2010 2009 m m Defined contribution schemes 2.7 3.1 Pension risk The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes which are all closed to new members.
The schemes are subject to risk regarding the relative amount of the schemes assets, which are affected by the value of investments and the returns generated by such investments, compared to the schemes liabilities, which are affected by changes in the life expectancy, actual and expected price inflation, changes in bond yields and future salary increases.
The difference in value between scheme assets and scheme liabilities may vary significantly in the short term, potentially resulting in an increased deficit or reduced surplus being recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
Legislation means that, on occasion, it may be appropriate to approach the Pensions Regulator for pre-clearance of agreements reached with the Pension Trustees at the time of significant corporate transactions.
Such clearance may include a requirement to increase the level of funding over a reduced timescale.
