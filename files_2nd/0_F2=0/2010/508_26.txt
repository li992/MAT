Notes to the Group Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is 120 Bothwell Street, Glasgow G2 7JS, UK.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements on a 52 or 53 week period.
The financial statements for the 2010 financial year reect the 52 week period ended 1 January 2011.
The financial statements for the 2009 financial year reect the 53 week period ended 2 January 2010.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures a New and amended standards adopted by the Group The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010.
IFRS 3 revised, Business combinations, and consequential amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and separate financial statements, IAS 28, Investments in associates, and IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures, are effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with some significant changes compared with IFRS 3.
For example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All acquisition-related costs are expensed.
b New and amended standards, and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 but not currently relevant to the Group although they may affect the accounting for future transactions and events IAS 27 revised requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
IAS 27 revised has had no impact on the current period.
IAS 38 amendment, Intangible assets, effective 1 January 2010.
The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has similar useful economic lives.
IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements effective 30 March 2009.
This interpretation applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services for example, under private finance initiative contracts PFI contracts.
Under these arrangements, assets are assessed as either intangible assets or finance receivables.
IFRIC 15, Agreements for construction of real estates effective 1 January 2009: EU-endorsed for use 1 January 2010.
This interpretation clarifies which standard IAS 18, Revenue, or IAS 11, Construction contracts should be applied to particular transactions.
86 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued IFRIC 16, Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation effective 1 July 2009.
This amendment states that, in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, qualifying hedging instruments may be held by any entity or entities within the group, including the foreign operation itself, as long as the designation, documentation and effectiveness requirements of IAS 39 that relate to a net investment hedge are satisfied.
In particular, the group should clearly document its hedging strategy because of the possibility of different designations at different levels of the group.
IFRIC 17, Distribution of non-cash assets to owners effective on or after 1 July 2009.
The interpretation was published in November 2008.
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends.
IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present condition and the distribution is highly probable.
IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers, effective for transfer of assets received on or after 1 July 2009 however the interpretation was only EU-endorsed for use in periods beginning on or after 31 October 2009.
This interpretation clarifies the requirements of IFRSs for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services such as a supply of electricity, gas or water.
In some cases, the entity receives cash from a customer that must be used only to acquire or construct the item of property, plant, and equipment in order to connect the customer to a network or provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services or to do both.
IFRS 2 amendments, Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions, effective from 1 January 2010.
In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2, and IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions, the amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation.
Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 2009 were issued in April 2009.
This is a collection of amendments to 12 standards.
The effective dates vary standard by standard but most are effective 1 January 2010. c New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 and not early adopted The Groups assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures on derecognition.
These amendments are part the IASBs comprehensive review of off balance sheet activities.
The amendments will promote transparency in the reporting of transfer transactions and improve users understanding of the risk exposures relating to transfers of financial assets and the effect of those risks on an entitys financial position, particularly those involving securitisation of financial asset.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments, issued in November 2009.
This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the Groups accounting for its financial assets.
The standard is not applicable until 1 January 2013 but is available for early adoption.
However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes.
Currently IAS 12 requires an entity to measure the deferred tax relating to an asset depending on whether the entity expects to recover the carrying amount of the asset through use or sale.
It can be difficult and subjective to assess whether recovery will be through use or through sale when the asset is measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 Investment Property.
Hence this amendment introduces an exception to the existing principle for the measurement of deferred tax assets or liabilities arising on investment property measured at fair value.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2012.
Amendments to IAS 24 revised, Related party disclosures, issued in November 2009.
It supersedes IAS 24, Related party disclosures, issued in 2003.
IAS 24 revised is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted.
The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party and removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government and other government-related entities.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 87 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued Classification of rights issues amendment to IAS 32, issued in October 2009.
The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010.
The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer.
Provided certain conditions are met, such rights issues are now classified as equity regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated.
Previously, these issues had to be accounted for as derivative liabilities.
The amendment applies retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors.
Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement amendments to IFRIC 14.
The amendments correct an unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
Without the amendments, entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments for minimum funding contributions.
This was not intended when IFRIC 14 was issued, and the amendments correct this.
The amendments should be applied retrospectively to the earliest comparative period presented.
IFRIC 19, Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments, effective 1 July 2010.
The interpretation clarifies the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability debt for equity swap.
It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
If the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the equity instruments should be measured to reect the fair value of the financial liability extinguished.
Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 2010 were issued in May 2010.
This is a collection of amendments to 6 standards and 1 IFRIC.
The effective dates vary standard by standard but most are effective 1 January 2011.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the other above standards or interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Aggreko plc and all its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding that confers more than half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
On an  basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling Interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportion of the share of the acquirees net assets.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
Revenue recognition Revenue for the Group represents the amounts earned from the supply of temporary power, temperature control, oil-free compressed air and related services and excludes sales taxes and intra-group revenue.
Revenue can comprise a fixed rental charge and a variable charge related to the usage of assets or other services.
In all cases, revenue is recognised in accordance with the contractual arrangements, for fixed rental charges, over the rental period and for variable elements as the asset is utilised or service is provided.
Revenue is accrued or deferred at the balance sheet date depending on the date of the most recent invoice issued and the contractual terms.
88 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the plc Board of Directors.
Aggrekos segments comprise Europe, Middle East & South East Europe, North America and International Local together the Groups Local business and International Power Projects IPP.
IPP is managed as a single business, with the deployment of assets varying from year to year depending on the location of projects.
This is reected by the Groups divisional management and organisational structure and the Groups internal financial reporting systems.
The segmental analysis is in Note 4 to the Accounts.
Central administrative costs are allocated between segments based on revenue.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Exceptional items Items are classified as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Group to be material and are different from events or transactions which fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually, or if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to be properly understood.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the asset into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised since the assets are assembled over a short period of time.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 25 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over the terms of each lease.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The periods of depreciation are reviewed on an annual basis and the principal periods used are as follows: Rental eet 8 to 10 years Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years Capital grants Capital grants in respect of additions to property, plant and equipment are netted against the cost of the related asset and this cost is depreciated in accordance with the policy above.
Intangibles Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition of each asset over their estimated useful lives as follows: customer relationships: 10 years: non-compete agreements: over the life of the non-compete agreements.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use in the specific software.
These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is currently deemed to be 4 years.
The useful life of intangible assets is reviewed on an annual basis.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment reviews, both annually and when there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 89 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued For the purpose of the impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets excluding goodwill Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets are amortised depreciated and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cashows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash ows cash-generating units.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates functional currency.
The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
At individual Company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings are translated into Sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Income and cash ow statements are translated at average rates of exchange for the period.
Gains and losses from the settlement of transactions and gains and losses on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments The activities of the Group expose it directly to the financial risks of changes in forward foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recorded and subsequently measured at fair value, which is calculated using standard industry valuation techniques in conjunction with observable market data.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ows using market interest rates and the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the reporting date.
The treatment of changes in fair value of derivatives depends on the derivative classification.
The Group designates derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions or commitments cash ow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated, and effective, as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in finance costs in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge is of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction that subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges of transactions that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in finance costs in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit and loss.
90 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in finance costs in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to finance costs in the income statement.
Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Overseas net investment hedges Certain foreign currency borrowings are designated as hedges of the Groups overseas net investments, which are denominated in the functional currency of the reporting operation.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings are taken to equity on consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
All other exchange gains and losses are dealt with through other income in the income statement.
Taxation Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, negative goodwill nor from the acquisition of an asset, which does not affect either taxable or accounting income.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current intention to remit such earnings.
Current tax The charge for the current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using the FIFO or weighted average cost basis.
Cost of raw materials, consumables and work in progress includes the cost of direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Inventory is written down on a case by case basis if the anticipated net realisable value declines below the carrying amount of the inventories.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
When the reasons for a write-down of the inventory have ceased to exist, the write-down is reversed.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 91 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued Employee benefits Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Where the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme and a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The cost for the year for the defined benefit scheme is determined using the attained age method with actuarial updates to the valuation being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in retained earnings, in the period in which they occur and are shown in the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The current service cost of the pension charge as well as the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are included in arriving at operating profit.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they become chargeable.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
An impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to collect all amounts due.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or large and old outstanding balances, particularly in countries where the legal system is not easily used to enforce recovery, are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written off against the provision for impairment of trade receivables account.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Provisions Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outow of resources that can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account the time value of money where material.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inow of economic benefits is probable.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Groups various employee-share and option schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for employee sharesave options and using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model for Executive share options.
Own shares held under trust for the Groups employee share schemes are classed as Treasury shares and deducted in arriving at shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on disposal of Treasury shares.
Purchases of own shares are disclosed as changes in shareholders equity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
The definition of cash and cash equivalents used in the cashow statement is cash in hand and deposits with a maturity of three months or less and includes bank overdrafts.
92 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Key assumptions and significant judgements The Group uses estimates and makes judgements in the preparation of its Accounts.
The most sensitive areas affecting the Accounts are discussed below.
Property, plant and equipment Rental eet accounts for 801.7 million, or around 93%, of the net book value of property, plant and equipment used in our business: the great majority of equipment in the rental eet is depreciated on a straight-line basis to a residual value of zero over 8 years, although we do have some classes which we depreciate over 10 years.
The annual eet depreciation charge of 146.8 million 2009: 138.1 million relates to the estimated service lives allocated to each class of eet asset.
Asset lives are reviewed regularly and changed if necessary to reect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
Intangible assets In accordance with IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations goodwill arising on acquisition of assets and subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 revised also requires the identification of other acquired intangible assets.
The techniques used to value these intangible assets are in line with internationally used models but do require the use of estimates and forecasts which may differ from actual outcomes.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation period adopted for these items and, potentially, by any differences between forecast and actual outcomes related to individual intangible assets.
The amortisation charge for intangible assets in 2010 was 2.8 million 2009: 2.7 million.
Included in this charge was 2.7 million related to the amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations 2009: 2.5 million.
Goodwill of 60.4 million 2009: 51.3 million is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The impairment review calculations require the use of forecasts related to the future profitability and cash generating ability of the acquired assets.
Pensions Pension arrangements vary for our employees and schemes reect best practice and regulation in each country.
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme for UK employees, which was closed to new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002: most of the other schemes in operation around the world are varieties of defined contribution schemes.
Under IAS 19: Employee Benefits Aggreko has recognised a pre-tax pension deficit of 3.2 million at 31 December 2010 2009: 5.8 million which is determined using actuarial assumptions.
The decrease in the pension deficit is a result of the additional contributions made by the Company during the year over and above the cost of accrual of benefits.
The Company paid 3.5 million in January 2010 in line with the Recovery Plan agreed for the Scheme following the actuarial valuation at 31 December 2008.
In addition higher-than-expected returns were achieved on Scheme assets over the year.
The additional contributions and investment returns have been offset by lower net interest rates used to value the liabilities.
The main assumptions used in IAS 19 valuation for the previous two years are shown in Note 25 of the Accounts.
The sensitivities regarding the assumptions are contained within the Detailed Financial Review on pages 41 and 42.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default, or large and old outstanding balances, particularly in countries where the legal system is not easily used to enforce recovery, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 93 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 1 Accounting policies continued The majority of the contracts into which the Group enters are small relative to the size of the Group and, if a customer fails to pay a debt, this is dealt with in the normal course of business.
However, some of the contracts the Group undertakes in developing countries are substantial, and are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk profile and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments and guarantees.
As a result of the rigorous approach to risk management, the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt.
At 31 December 2010 the provision for impairment of trade receivables in the balance sheet was 33.4 million 2009: 26.2 million.
Taxation Aggrekos tax charge of 30.0% is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in force at the balance sheet date.
In addition to corporation tax, Aggreko is subject to indirect taxes such as sales and employment taxes across tax jurisdictions in the approximately 100 countries in which the Group operates.
The varying nature and complexity of the tax law requires the Group to review its tax positions and make appropriate judgements at the balance sheet date.
Further detail, including a detailed tax reconciliation, is shown at Note 9 to the Annual Report and Accounts.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include liquidity, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk.
The Group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the Groups funding requirements as they arise, and that financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations is effectively identified and managed.
The treasury operations are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and are reviewed annually.
Financial instruments are only executed for hedging purposes and transactions that are speculative in nature are expressly forbidden.
Monthly reports are provided to senior management and treasury operations are subject to periodic internal and external review.
Liquidity, funding and capital management The Groups objective with respect to managing capital is to maintain a balance sheet structure that safeguards the Groups financial position through economic cycles and one that is efficient in terms of providing long term returns to shareholders.
If appropriate the Group can choose to adjust its capital structure by varying the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, by returning of capital to shareholders, by issuing new shares or by adjusting the level of capital expenditure.
Gearing at 31 December 2010 decreased to 16% from 29% at 31 December 2009.
Total capital is equity as shown in the Group balance sheet.
The Group maintains sufficient facilities to meet its normal funding requirements over the medium-term.
At 31 December 2010 these facilities are primarily in the form of committed bank facilities totalling 604.1 million, arranged on a bilateral basis with a number of international banks.
The financial covenants attached to these facilities are that EBITDA should be no less than 4 times interest and net debt should be no more than 3 times EBITDA.
The Group does not consider that these financial covenants are restrictive to its operations.
The maturity profile of the borrowings is detailed in Note 17 in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Net debt amounted to 132.2 million at 31 December 2010 and at that date undrawn committed facilities were 470.1 million.
Towards the end of 2010, we refinanced 459 million of bank facilities, putting in place new facilities with maturities of 3 and 5 years.
In addition, since the year end, we have for the first time raised funding in the US private placement market, securing US$275 million 177 million, with maturities ranging between 7 and 10 years and with the same financial covenants as our banking facilities.
Drawdown of these funds will take place in mid March 2011.
94 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to minimise the exposure to interest rates by ensuring an appropriate balance of fixed and oating rates.
The Groups primary funding is at oating rates through its bank facilities.
In order to manage the associated interest rate risk, the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary the mix of fixed and oating rates.
At 31 December 2010, 110.9 million of the net debt of 132.2 million was at fixed rates of interest resulting 1 in a fixed to oating rate net debt ratio of 84:16 2009: 61:39.
The Group monitors its interest rate exposure on a regular basis by applying forecast interest rates to the Groups forecast net debt profile after taking into account its existing hedges.
The Group also calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift for all currencies.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on profit or loss of a -100 basis-point shift, after taking into account existing hedges, would be 0.5 million 2009: 0.7 million.
The sensitivity analysis is performed on a monthly basis and is reported to the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to currency exposure on the translation into Sterling of its net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
In order to reduce the currency risk arising, the Group uses direct borrowings in the same currency as those investments.
Group borrowings are predominantly drawn down in the principal currencies affecting the Group, namely US Dollar, Euro and Sterling.
The Group manages its currency ows to minimise foreign exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where appropriate in order to hedge net currency ows.
The positive impact of currency, largely due to the movement in the US Dollar and the Australian Dollar, increased our revenues by 23.4 million 2009: 145.9 million and trading profit by 6.5 million 2009: 35.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2010.
The Group monitors the impact of exchange closely and regularly carries out sensitivity analysis.
For every 5 cents movement in the US Dollar to GBP exchange rate there is an approximate 2 impact of 9.1 million 2009: 7.2 million in trading profit in terms of translation.
For every 5 cents movement in the Euro to GBP exchange rate there is an approximate impact of 0.5 million 2009: 0.3 million in trading profit in terms of translation.
Currency translation also gave rise to a 39.1 million increase in reserves as a result of year on year movements in the exchange rates 2009: decrease of 30.9 million.
For every 5 cents movement in the US Dollar and Euro, there is an approximate impact in equity of 3.3 million and 0.6 million respectively 2009: 3.4 million and 1.5 million, arising from the currency translation of external borrowings which are being used as a net investment hedge, however this will be offset by a corresponding movement in the equity of the net investment being hedged.
Credit risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties.
The Group manages this risk by limiting the aggregate amounts and their duration depending on external credit ratings of the relevant counterparty.
In the case of financial assets exposed to credit risk, the carrying amount in the balance sheet, net of any applicable provisions for loss, represents the amount exposed to credit risk.
Management of trade receivables The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
At an operating unit level a credit rating is normally established for each customer based on ratings from external agencies.
Where no ratings are available, cash in advance payment terms are often established for new customers.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis.
Some of the contracts undertaken in our IPP business are substantial, and are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk profile and debtor-position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments and bank guarantees.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at Group level.
Contracts are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the customer and country risk.
Insurance The Group operates a policy of buying cover against the material risks which the business faces, where it is possible to purchase such cover on reasonable terms.
Where this is not possible, or where the risks would not have a material impact on the Group as a whole, we self-insure.
1 The increase in this ratio is driven by a decrease in Group net debt rather than an increase in the absolute value of fixed rate debt.
2 Trading profit represents operating profit before gain on sale of property, plant and equipment.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to expected changes in revenue and the cost base, discount rates and long-term growth rates.
The discount rate used for business valuations was 9.3% after tax 2009: 9.8%, 12.9% before tax 2009: 13.6% based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
On the basis that the business carried out by all CGUs is closely related and assets can be redeployed around the Group as required, a consistent Group discount rate has been used for all CGUs.
Values in use were determined using current year cashows, a prudent view of future market trends and excludes any growth capital expenditure.
A terminal cash ow was calculated using a long-term growth rate of 2.0%.
As at 31 December 2010, based on internal valuations, Aggreko plc management concluded that the values in use of the CGUs significantly exceeded their net asset value.
The Directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions made in their impairment calculations that would give rise to an impairment.

43% of the amounts past due are less than 30 days past due 2009: 66%.
The Group assesses credit quality differently in relation to its two business models as explained below: Local business Our Local business serves customers in Middle East & South East Europe, Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia, Central & South America and Africa.
It is a high transaction intensive business focused on frequently occurring events and the majority of the contracts in this business are small relative to the size of the Group.
There is no concentration of credit risk in this business other than in the case of a major event, for example, the Asian Games in Guangzhou, which is included in the International Local business segment.
Apart from these type of major events there are a large number of customers who are unrelated and internationally dispersed.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
The effectiveness of this credit process has meant that the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt in the Local business.
International Power Projects IPP Our International Power Projects business concentrates on medium to very large contracts.
Most projects in this business are worth over 1 million and some can be worth over 10 million.
Customers are mainly in developing countries and include power utilities, governments, armed forces, oil companies and mining companies.
In addition the majority of the contracts above are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk profile and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bonds and guarantees.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at a Group level.
To date the Group has also had a low level of bad debt in the IPP business although the risk of a major default is high.
The total trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2010 for our IPP business was 120.9 million 2009: 80.9 million.
Within this balance receivable balances totalling 69.5 million 2009: 43.4 million had some form of payment cover attached to them.
This payment cover guards against the risk of customer default rather than the risk associated with customer disputes.
The risk associated with the remaining 51.4 million 2009: 37.5 million is deemed to be either acceptable or payment cover is not obtainable in a cost effective manner.

A further 9.6 million of bank facilities, arranged prior to the year end, became available for drawdown on 3 February 2011. iii Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2010, after taking account of the interest rate swaps used to manage the interest profile, was: Fixed rate debt Weighted Weighted average average period for Floating Fixed interest which rate rate rate Total rate is fixed million million million % Years Currency: Sterling US Dollar 13.7 93.6 107.3 4.6 5.8 Euro 0.1 17.3 17.4 5.0 2.6 Brazil Reais 16.2 16.2 Indian Rupees 10.1 10.1 Other currencies 7.6 7.6 At 31 December 2010 47.7 110.9 158.6 Sterling 39.0 39.0 US Dollar 18.6 89.5 108.1 4.6 6.8 Euro 15.1 17.8 32.9 5.0 3.6 Brazil Reais 6.9 6.9 Indian Rupees 3.7 3.7 Other currencies 7.1 7.1 At 31 December 2009 90.4 107.3 197.7 The oating rate financial liabilities principally comprise debt which carries interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance and are normally fixed in advance for periods between one and three months.
106 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Accounts 17 Borrowings continued The weighted average interest rate on fixed debt is derived from the fixed leg of each interest rate swap.
The effect of the Groups interest rate swaps is to classify 110.9 million 2009: 107.3 million of borrowings in the above table as fixed rate.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2010 was 110.9 million 2009: 107.3 million.

i Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2010.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Market values have been used to determine fair values.
2010 2009 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value million million million million Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Current borrowings and overdrafts 47.3 47.3 17.7 17.7 Non-current borrowings 111.3 111.3 180.0 180.0 Short-term deposits 6.4 6.4 0.5 0.5 Cash at bank and in hand 20.0 20.0 21.7 21.7 Derivative financial instruments held: Interest rate swaps 9.5 9.5 6.7 6.7 Forward foreign currency contracts 0.9 0.9 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 107 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 18 Financial instruments continued ii Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts Fair value is based on market price of these instruments at the balance sheet date.
Current borrowings and overdrafts Short-term deposits The fair value of short-term deposits and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as all debt is raised on a oating rate basis where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
iii Financial instruments Numerical financial instruments disclosures are set out below.
Additional disclosures are set out in the financial review and accounting policies relating to risk management.

These will be allocated to the cost of the asset as a basis adjustment when the forecast capital expenditure occurs.
The net fair value liability at 31 December 2010 on open interest swaps that hedge interest risk are 9.5 million 2009: liability of 6.7 million.
These will be debited to the income statement interest charge over the remaining life of each interest rate swap.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its overseas subsidiaries its US Dollar and Euro denominated borrowings.
The fair value of the US Dollar borrowings at 31 December 2010 was 107.1 million 2009: 108.1 million, and the Euro borrowings 17.3 million 2009: 32.9 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 2.8 million 2009: loss of 24.2 million on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.

29.0 million of interest rate swaps are due to mature in 2011.
The Groups interest rate swap portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is consistent with Group policy as described on page 95.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2010 2009 Bank overdraft 10.9% 9.0% Bank borrowings 2.3% 1.3% Maturity of financial liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities into the relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

20 Deferred tax 2010 2009 million million At 1 January 29.5 19.8 Impact of reduction in UK CT rate to 27% from 1 April 2011 0.8 Charge to the income statement Note 9 2.3 9.8 Credit charge to equity 12.2 3.0 Exchange differences 1.5 3.1 At 31 December 20.3 29.5 The proposed reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax by 1 per cent per year to 24 per cent by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the changes from 27 per cent to 24 per cent, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 December 2010 would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by approximately 0.9 million being 0.3 million recognised in 2012, 0.3 million recognised in 2013 and 0.3 million recognised in 2014.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings will qualify for the UK dividend exemption and the Group can control the distribution of dividends by its subsidiaries.
In some countries, local tax is payable on the remittance of a dividend.
Were dividends to be remitted from these countries, the additional tax payable would be 3.1 million.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to off setting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
110 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Accounts 20 Deferred tax continued Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related deferred tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 1.4 million 2009: 4.2 million of which 1.4 million 2009: 4.2 million relates to carried forward tax losses as our forecasts indicate that these assets will not reverse in the near future.
Deferred tax assets of 3.2 million 2009: 2.6 million have been recognised in respect of entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period.

In addition 213,406 shares were allotted to US participants in the Long-term Incentive Plan by the allotment of new shares at 20 pence per share.
Share options The options under the Savings-Related Share Option Schemes have been granted at a discount of 20% on the share price calculated over the three days prior to the date of invitation to participate, mature after three to five years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the US Stock Purchase Plan have been granted at a discount of 15% to the share price on the date of grant, mature after two years and are normally exercisable in the three months following the maturity date.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 111 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2010 21 Share capital continued The options under the Executive Share Option Scheme are normally only exercisable once three years have elapsed from date of grant and lapse after ten years.
All Executive Options are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the consolidated income statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
For Executive Share Options granted prior to 25 April 2001, at the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the Companys TSR since the date of grant of the option is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys annual EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
There is no legal obligation upon the Company to satisfy the options existing under the Savings-Related and Executive Share Option Schemes other than by the allotment of new issue shares.
It is intended to satisfy awards to US participants in the Long-term Incentive Plan by the allotment of new shares.
The maximum award would be made on achieving the performance targets set out on pages 69 and 70 of the Remuneration Report.
Aggreko has taken the IFRS 1 exemption to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to options that were granted after 7 November 2002 and were not vested at 1 January 2005.

United Kingdom The Group operates pension schemes for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, defined benefit scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the Directors of Aggreko Pension Scheme Trustee Limited.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2008 using the Attained Age method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets were taken at market value.
The major actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 4.8% Rate of increase in salaries 4.6% Increase in pensions 3.1% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets excluding AVCs was 32.6 million which was sufficient to cover 67% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after making allowances for future increases in earnings.
As part of the valuation at 31 December 2008, the Company and the trustees agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
From 1 January 2010 to 31 March 2010 the company paid contributions for benefits building up in future at a rate of 25.4% of pensionable earnings and from 1 April 2010 the company paid 28.0% of pensionable earnings plus administration costs.
To address the Scheme deficit the Group made additional contributions of 3.5 million in December 2010.
