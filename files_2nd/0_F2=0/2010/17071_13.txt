Wh Smith PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 50 5.
RETIREMENT bENEfIT ObLIGATION WH Smith PLC has operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a defined benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a defined contribution scheme, WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant scheme is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 5 a i.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities for the respective schemes at the relevant reporting dates were: m 2010 2009 WHSmith Pension Trust United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme 1 2 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 1 2 a Defined benefit pension scheme i The WHSmith Pension Trust The WHSmith Pension Trust was closed to defined benefit service accrual on 2 April 2007 and has been closed to new members since 1996.
The WHSmith Pension Trust is independent of the Group and is administered by a Trustee.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a new investment policy.
The assets in the investment fund were restructured and substantially invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest and inflation a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2009 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Following this valuation, the deficit was 113m, and a revised deficit funding schedule of 11m per annum subject to indexation over the following ten years was agreed with the Trustee.
During the year, the Group made a contribution of 13m to the WHSmith Pension Trust 2009: 10m in accordance with the agreed pension deficit funding schedule, which includes a catch-up payment relating to the period from 31 March 2009 to the date that the revised contributions started to be paid.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in relation to this plan are as follows: m 2010 2009 Present value of the obligations 761 717 Fair value of plan assets 855 743 Surplus in the scheme 94 26 Amounts not recognised 94 26 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet The pension scheme is closed to further accrual and given the LDI policy adopted by the Pension Trustee, the present value of the economic benefits of the IAS 19 surplus in the pension scheme of 94m 2009: 26m available on a reduction of future contributions is nil 2009: nil.
As a result the Group has not recognised this IAS 19 surplus on the balance sheet.
The valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme used for the IAS 19 disclosures is based upon the most recent valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the relevant reporting date.
The principal long-term assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were: % 2010 2009 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred pensions 3.26 3.48 Discount rate 4.87 5.29 Inflation assumptions 3.26 3.48 The amounts recognised in the income statement were as follows: m 2010 2009 Current service cost Interest cost 37 41 Expected return on scheme assets 37 40 1 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Wh Smith PLC 51 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 5.

Management has determined that no impairment was necessary for the current financial year 2009: nil.
All goodwill relates to the acquisitions of groups of retail stores and each CGU is sensitive to movements in the same key assumptions.
The key assumptions on which forecast three-year cash flows of the CGUs are based include sales growth, product mix and operating costs.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, and external information on expected future trends in the UK retail industry.
These cash flows are extrapolated for an additional nine years representing the average length of the lease for the relevant group of stores based on long-term growth rates.
The long-term growth rates used are between 2.25 per cent and 2.5 per cent, reflecting expected retail price index growth.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is ten per cent pre-tax 2009: ten per cent.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included an increase in the discount rate of up to one per cent and a decrease in the long-term growth rate of up to one per cent.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario.

Included in other intangible assets are certain assets considered to have an indefinite life, representing certain rights under tenancy agreements, which include the right to renew leases.
Management has determined that the useful economic life of these assets is indefinite because the Company can continue to occupy and trade from certain premises for an indefinite period.
During the period the Group acquired 50 per cent of the issued share capital of Spilt Ink Studio Limited, a company involved in online retailing.
The consideration for the acquisition comprised cash and contingent consideration payable in two years based on certain performance criteria.
The contingent consideration is considered immaterial in the context of these financial statements.
Details of revenues and profits generated have not been disclosed as they are not material in the context of these financial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Wh Smith PLC 63 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 25. fINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Risk management The Groups Treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.
Capital risk The Groups objectives with respect to managing capital defined as net debt funds plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
In managing the Groups capital levels the Board regularly monitors the level of debt in the business, the working capital requirements, forecast financing and investing cash flows.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to investors while ensuring sufficient capital is retained in the business to meet its strategic objectives.
The Board has a progressive dividend policy and expects that, over time, dividends would be broadly covered twice by earnings calculated on a normalised tax basis.
As at 14 October 2010 the Group has in place a 90m committed revolving credit facility, carrying certain financial covenants which have been met throughout the period.
The covenants, tested half-yearly, are based on fixed charges cover and net borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
The Group has a committed facility with a number of financial institutions which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital.
Treasury has a policy of pooling Group cash flows in order to optimise the return on surplus cash and also to utilise cash within the Group to reduce the costs of external short-term funding.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities: Due within Due between Due between Due over 2010 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 291 1 292 Finance leases Total cash flows 291 1 292 Due within Due between Due between Due over 2009 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 273 1 274 Finance leases 2 2 Total cash flows 275 1 276 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, hedging, settlement and other financial activities.
The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Group has a credit risk attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
Wh Smith PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010 64 The Group has a low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is considered to be low, as the Board approved Group Treasury Policy limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
These limits are based on a combination of short-term credit ratings of P-1 A-1 and long-term ratings of A1 A or better.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 31 August 2010, the Group had drawn down nil 2009: nil from its committed revolving credit facility.
The Group draws down periodically on its facility, but does not view any draw down as long term in nature and therefore does not enter into interest rate derivatives to mitigate this risk.
foreign currency risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of the changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are principally to the US dollar and euro.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The hedging instruments have been used to hedge purchases in US dollars and to minimise foreign exchange risk in movements of the USD GBP exchange rates.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At 31 August 2010, the Group had no material un-hedged currency exposures.
The Groups euro exposure is principally operational and arises mainly through the operation of retail stores in France and Ireland.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposure.
The fair value of cash flow hedges recognised on the balance sheet within derivative assets liabilities is shown below: m 2010 2009 Fair value of derivative assets 1 At 31 August 2010, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed is US$29m 2009: US$38m.
These instruments will be used to hedge cash flows occurring usually within one year of the balance sheet date.
Gains totalling 2m 2009: 5m have been transferred to both the income statement and inventories in respect of contracts that matured during the year ended 31 August 2010.
In the year to 31 August 2010, the fair value loss on the Groups currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounted to 1m 2009: 1m loss.
Sensitivity analysis as at 31 August 2010 Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and USD GBP and EUR GBP exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the hedging reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
Group debt and hedging activities remain constant, reflecting the positions at 31 August 2009 and 31 August 2010 respectively.
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Groups income statement and equity given reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in GBP LIBOR Base Rate to be one per cent, based on interest rate history.
