Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Basic salary Policy: Based on experience and role Policy The Remuneration Committee has historically set the salaries of some of the Executives at the upper decile against the Companys comparator group reflecting the Committees view that Berkeley has one of the most experienced and capable Executive teams within the sector and that Executive Directors had been in their roles for a number of years.
Reflecting the changes to the Board in the year, the Committee believes that it is right to take account of the following factors in setting individual salary levels: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group: the performance of the individual Executive Director and the Group: and the pay and conditions throughout the Group.
In applying its policy on appointment to the Board and promotion, the Remuneration Committee sets salaries at a lower quartile level which, based on appropriate levels of individual and corporate performance, will be increased with experience gained over time.
