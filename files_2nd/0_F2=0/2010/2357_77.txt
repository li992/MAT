Report on the activities of the Audit Committee continued External auditors During the year under review the Audit Committee reviewed the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.
This included information about the policies and processes for maintaining independence, monitoring compliance with relevant requirements and ethical guidance and consideration of all relationships between the Company and the external auditors and their staff.
A policy continues in place which requires the Audit Committee to approve all non-audit services proposed to be undertaken by the external auditors, with the exception of tax advisory and compliance work undertaken in the ordinary course of business and pension scheme audit work.
When a request for approval is made, the Audit Committee would have due regard to the nature of the non-audit service, whether the external auditors were a suitable supplier, whether there was likely to be any threat to objectivity and independence in the conduct of the audit and the related fee level both separately and relative to the audit fee.
For details of fees paid to the external auditors, see note 5 on page 61.

It was concluded that the Committee and the audit process continued to be effective, and that the Committee had appropriate terms of reference and achieved its remit.
Briefings are provided where appropriate to ensure that the Committee remains informed of all material developments in best practice and regulation concerning its remit.
