74 | NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 7 Earnings per ordinary share continued A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value based on the aggregate of the exercise price of each share option and the fair value of future services to be supplied to the Group which is the unamortised share-based payments charge.
The difference between the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value and the total number of options is used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.

The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of the current five year pre-tax forecasts.
Key assumptions are as follows: i Cash flows beyond a five year period are not extrapolated: ii A pre-tax discount rate of 9.12% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The Directors have identified no reasonably possible change in a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.
Other intangible assets relate to contracts for the sale of units that had reserved or exchanged at the date of the acquisition of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited that the Group did not already own.
This resulted in an intangible asset of 3,273,000 at the acquisition date.
This intangible asset is amortised as these reserved or exchanged units are taken to profit and is included in net operating expenses.
During the year the last units which were forward sold at the acquisition date were taken to profit and there is no remaining balance at 30 April 2010.
