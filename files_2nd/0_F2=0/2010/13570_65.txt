As this rate change was substantively enacted prior to the year end, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been restated.
the resulting charges or credits have been recognised in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to oci or equity.
Accordingly, in 2010, 3m has been credited to the income statement, 1m has been charged to oci and 1m has been charged directly to equity.
had the further tax rate changes been substantively enacted before the balance sheet date, it would have had the effect of reducing the defered tax asset and liability by 27m and 29m respectively.
