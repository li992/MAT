29 Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions where such differences arise.
Movements in deferred income tax net liabilities assets in the year are as follows: Deferred tax m At 1 April 2008 106 Credited to income 39 Credited to statement of comprehensive income 40 Charged directly to equity 4 Exchange differences 17 At 31 March 2009 48 Credited to income 108 Credited to statement of comprehensive income 25 Credited directly to equity 1 Exchange differences 2 At 31 March 2010 84 Of the amounts of deferred tax credited to income and equity, 0.3 million 2009 1 million arises from changes in tax rates.
There was no impact from the imposition of new taxes.
Deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised tax losses of 371 million 2009 293 million have not been recognised to the extent that they exceed taxable profits against which these assets may be recovered.
No unrelieved tax losses expired under current tax legislation in the year ended 31 March 2010.
The total deferred tax on unremitted earnings is 3.3 million of which 0.6 million has been recognised.
The Group has not recognised the remaining amount as it is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences arising from unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 2.7 million 2009 1.1 billion.
The reduction in temporary differences was due to the introduction of the UK dividend exemption regime on 1 July 2009.
