Intangible assets continued Impairment test for cash-generating units containing goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill.
The most significant elements of the Groups total consolidated goodwill of 197.3 million at 2 January 2011 are allocated to the Morgan AM&T cash-generating unit.
Goodwill is attributed to each cash-generating unit as follows: 2010 2009 m m Morgan AM&T 104.8 117.0 Molten Metal Systems 2.2 2.1 Technical Ceramics 69.3 67.2 Thermal Ceramics 21.0 20.5 197.3 206.8 Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
As part of the annual impairment test review the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its value in use reflecting the projected discounted cash flows of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections are based relate to growth rates and discount rates.
The cash flow projections in year one are based on budgeted operating results for the forthcoming year.
The budget for 2011 was approved in November 2010.
Growth rates for the period not covered by budgets are specific to each operating segment, ranging from 4.0% to 6.0% 2009: 4.4% to 6.9%.
These growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the operating segments operate.
These mediumto long-term growth rates have been reviewed by management during 2010 and are considered to remain appropriate.
Given the similar risk profiles of each of the operating segments, together with common funding from the central Group Treasury function, a standard pre-tax discount rate of 12.2% 2009: 12.9%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, has been used in discounting the projected cash flows and calculating the terminal value at the end of year five.
This discount rate has been used as the Group believes it suitably approximates the rate used by end-market participants.
The Directors have considered the following individual sensitivities and are confident that no impairment would arise in any of the following three circumstances: if the pre-tax discount rate was increased by 650bps to 18.7% 2009: 15.9% : if no growth was assumed for years two to five and in the calculation of terminal value: and if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 40% 2009: 25%.
