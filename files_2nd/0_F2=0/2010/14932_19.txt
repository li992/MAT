Judgements, estimates and assumptions Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised.
Share Based payments Where equity-settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement of financial position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
