The Group is currently assessing the impact, if any, that these standards will have on the presentation of its consolidated results.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies, together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found as follows: Functional currency note 1 Revenue recognition note 2 Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 11 Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities note 24 Share-based payments note 28 14119 PG p14-109.

Accounting policies continued Basis of accounting The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain financial instruments.
Functional and reporting currency Reflecting the fact that the Eurozone has become the predominant economic environment in which the Groups gaming companies operate based on the currencies with which players fund their accounts, as well as the expected opening of a number of newly regulated regimes in France, Italy and other Eurozone markets, the Group has changed the functional currency of certain of its gaming companies from US dollars to Euros.
In line with IAS 21 the change took effect from the date the Group determined that the characteristics required to identify the functional currency had changed.
The Group determined this occurred during 2010 and for accounting purposes is effective from 1 January 2010.
In addition, the Group has changed in 2010 the reporting currency used for the financial statements of the Group from US dollars to Euros, as the gaming companies referred to above represent a significant majority of the Groups revenue.
All financial data for prior periods has been converted using the exchange rate at 1 January 2010 of 1 US dollar 0.695 Euros.
As the Companys only significant transactions are in US dollars, instalments of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, funded by surplus US dollars generated by the rest of the Group, the US dollar continues to be its functional currency.
To be consistent with the Group the reporting currency of the Company has also been changed to Euros.
A number of Group companies operate in functional currencies other than Euros.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by PartyGaming Plc.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Except as noted below, the financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting, and are consolidated from the date of acquisition i. e. the date on which control of the subsidiary effectively commences to the date of disposal i. e. the date on which control over the subsidiary effectively ceases.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Under section 10 2 of the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own statement of comprehensive income.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Companys acquisition of the controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited The Companys controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, PartyGaming Holdings Limited formerly Headwall Ventures Limited, was acquired through a transaction under common control, using a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.

Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains specific exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.

Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity.
From 2010 onwards, as a result of adoption of IFRS 3 Revised all acquisition-related expenses are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.

Externally acquired intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separate from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal rights.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.

Accounting policies continued Internally generated intangible assets research and development expenditure Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Groups software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets Amortisation is provided to write-off the cost of all intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, evenly over the periods the Group expects to benefit from their use, and varies between: Brand and domain names 10% to 20% per annum Broadcast libraries 50% per annum Capitalised development expenditure 20% to 33% per annum Contractual relationships over the length of the contract Customer lists and contracts 20% to 50% per annum Intellectual property and gaming licences over the length of the licence Non-contractual relationships 33% per annum Software 20% to 33% per annum Impairment of goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment At the end of each reporting year, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Impairments related to goodwill are not reversed.

Accounting policies continued Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale.
Investments Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Group's strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
In accordance with IAS 39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the available for sale reserve.
On sale, the amount held in the available-forsale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only non-market vesting conditions, on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability.
Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes being recorded in consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group records the expense based on the fair value of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For cash payments made by parties related to Principal Shareholders, the charge is recorded when there is a commitment to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Companys or a subsidiarys share price are made, by shareholder s or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder s, the transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder s, the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment reserve.
Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.
Treasury shares Treasury shares relate to shares gifted to the Employee Trust by the Company.
The cost of treasury shares creates an own share reserve.
When options issued by the Employee Trust are exercised the own share reserve is reduced and a gain or loss is recognised in reserves based on proceeds less weighted-average cost of shares exercised.
Provisions and contingent liabilities The Group recognises a provision in the consolidated statement of financial position when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an outflow of economic benefits, no provision is made.
Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of outflow of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cashflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.

Accounting policies continued Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage currency cashflows and to hedge foreign exchange risk on non-US dollar denominated financial assets and liabilities.
The derivative instruments used by the Group consist mainly of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value calculated using either discounted cashflow techniques or by reference to market prices supplied by banks.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group presently does not adopt any form of hedge accounting as described in IAS 39 and does not anticipate any requirement to do so in the foreseeable future.
Financial assets The Groups financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans, receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
These include restricted cash and unrestricted bank deposits with maturities of more than three months.
Amounts held as security deposits are considered to be restricted cash.
There are no financial assets that are classified as held to maturity.
A category for in the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments held as at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009.
Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Group's strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the available for-sale reserve.
Short-term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They arise principally through the amounts due from payment processors that remit funds on behalf of customers and other types of contractual monetary asset and cash and cash equivalents.
They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables represent short-term monetary assets which are recognised at fair value less impairment and other related provisions, which are recognised when there is objective evidence primarily default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due.
The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cashflows associated with the impaired receivable.
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities include the following items: Client liabilities, including amounts due to progressive prize pools.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Loans and borrowings, comprising bank borrowings and overdrafts, which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
A category for out of the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2009.

Accounting policies continued Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
The Groups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Segment information For management purposes and transacting with customers, the Groups operations can be segmented into the following reporting segments: poker including backgammon, casino, bingo, sports betting and unallocated corporate including World Poker Tour.
These segments are the basis upon which the Group reports its segment information.
Unallocated corporate expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the Group as a whole and are not allocated to individual segments.
The measure of reporting segment performance is Clean EBITDA and the basis for arriving at this is the same as the Group accounts.

At the year end there were Group companies registered in 13 countries including Gibraltar.
However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the financial statements.
Factors that may affect future tax charges In Gibraltar, the Group benefited from the exempt company regime, which was phased out on 31 December 2010.
Assessable income is taxed in Gibraltar at the rate of 10% thereafter.
In India, the Group benefits from a tax holiday on income from qualifying activities until March 2011: under current rules assessable income is taxed in India at approximately 34%.
A Minimum Alternative Tax of approximately 17% applies.
As the Group is involved in worldwide operations, future tax charges will be affected by the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions.

Earnings per share EPS continued Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held as treasury shares.

Clean EBITDA and Clean earnings per share are performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of the business and remove the impact of one-off and noncash items.
They are therefore calculated before the provision for items associated with the Groups Non-Prosecution Agreement, reorganisation costs, merger and acquisition costs and before non-cash charges relating to share-based payments.
Clean net earnings attributable to equity shareholders is derived as follows: 2010 2009 Continuing Discontinued Continuing Discontinued operations operations Total operations operations Total Year ended 31 December million million million million million million Earnings loss for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share being profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 40.2 1.3 38.9 53.3 71.8 18.5 Share-based payments 9.2 9.2 6.2 6.2 Provision for payments associated with the Groups Non-Prosecution Agreement 70.2 70.2 Unwinding of discount associated with the Groups Non-Prosecution Agreement 1.1 1.1 1.0 1.0 Merger and acquisition expenses 4.9 4.9 Reorganisation expenses 0.7 0.7 1.3 1.3 Clean net earnings loss 55.0 0.2 54.8 60.8 0.6 60.2 2010 2009 Number Number Year ended 31 December million million Weighted average number of shares Number of shares in issue as at 1 January 412.4 411.5 Number of shares in issue as at 1 January held by the Employee Trust 4.6 6.7 Weighted average number of shares issued during the year 0.4 0.3 Weighted average number of shares purchased during the year 0.2 Effect of vested share options 0.3 2.0 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share 408.5 406.9 Effect of potential dilutive unvested shares 23.2 14.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share 431.7 421.1 In accordance with IAS 33, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share takes into account all potentially dilutive shares granted which are not included in the number of shares for basic earnings per share above.
Although the unvested, potentially dilutive shares are contingently issuable, in accordance with IAS 33 the year end is treated as the end of the performance period.
Those option holders who were employees at that date are deemed to have satisfied the performance requirements and their related potentially dilutive shares have been included for the purpose of diluted EPS.

The value of acquired intangibles is based on cashflow projections at the time of acquisition.
Customer lists from existing customers take into account the expected impact of player attrition.
Other intangibles primarily include development expenditure, long-term gaming and intellectual property licences and purchased domain names.
Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally.
Licences are amortised over the life of the licences and other intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years.
During 2010 both contingent consideration, and consequently goodwill, were subsequently revised down by 3.7 million based on Cashcades profit performance in 2010 which was in the middle of the target range for the earnout.

Intangible assets continued Impairment In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets.
A detailed review was undertaken at 31 December 2010 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cashflows derived from those assets.
In respect of the PartyPoker, EOL IOG, WPT and Cashcade CGUs, the directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.

The Group believes that going beyond five years cashflows in the value in use calculations is appropriate given the Group is an established business and is a leader in a growth industry.
The projections include the formally approved budget for 2011 and detailed projections covering the following two year period to 31 December 2013.
Operating margins have been based on past experience and future expectations in the light of anticipated economic and market conditions.
Discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect managements assessment of specific risks related to the CGU.
Growth rates have been based on estimates published in February 2010 by H2 Gambling Capital, an independent consultant to the online gambling industry.

The Justice and Public Safety Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has filed a civil suit against PartyGaming Plc and other defendants in Franklin Circuit Court, a state court in Kentucky in the US.
The suit, which was filed by private attorneys reportedly engaged on a contingencyfee basis, seeks a claim for damages of $47 million which includes treble recovery of losses allegedly suffered by Kentucky residents who played on the Company's websites from 5 August 2005, until the Company's termination of USfacing activity on 13 October 2006, along with interest and costs.

Financial instruments and risk management In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: investments: short-term investments: trade and other receivables: cash and cash equivalents: loans and borrowings: trade and other payables: client liabilities and progressive prize pools: and foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign exchange contracts are regularly used in the normal course of business but none were outstanding as at 31 December 2010 or at the prior year end.
The Group operates a sports betting business and always has open bets.
As at 31 December 2010 and at the prior year end the fair market value of open bets was not material.
Other financial derivative instruments are permitted to be used by the Group, but none were used in the period ended 31 December 2010 or in the prior year.
Management controls and procedures The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Groups treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee see below.
As such, the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Groups treasury department.
The treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage these underlying risks.
No other derivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the accounting implications would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee.
The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These polices include benchmark exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The Group risk management policies would also be reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant changes to the Groups business.
Exposures are monitored and reported to management on a weekly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded.
The internal control procedures and risk management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the internal audit function.
The last internal control review was undertaken during 2010 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups treasury department ensures that the Groups cash and cash equivalents, and amounts due from payment service providers PSPs exceed its combined client liabilities at all times.
This excess is defined as the Client Liability Cover.
Client liabilities principally represent customer deposits and progressive prize pools.
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts due from PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a weekly basis.
The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of $150 million that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no significant concentration of refinancing risk.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
During 2009 the Group borrowed 35 million as a means of managing liquidity risk and at the end of 2010 had an unutilised borrowing facility of 34 million in place as a means of managing liquidity risk should the proposed merger with bwin Interactive Entertainment AG be completed.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Capital risk In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Groups net income.
Accordingly, the Groups policy is that gross debt should not exceed $300 million and that the leverage ratio of gross debt clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x.
An analysis of gross debt is as follows: As at 31 December 2010 2009 Gross debt million 40.7 39.3 Clean EBITDA million 100.2 93.2 Headroom million 109.6 100.5 Ratio 0.4 0.4 Details of the Groups dividend policy is disclosed in the Charimans Statement and also on page 18 of this Annual Report under the heading Review of 2010. Credit risk Operational: The Groups operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Groups websites.
Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable external source.
Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis and promptly takes corrective action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded.
For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as industry knowledge, their statement of financial position, profitability, customer diversification, geographic diversification, long-term stability, management credibility, potential regulatory risk and historic payment track record.
These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis by the Director of Payment Processing.
An internal rating of one is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of five is assessed as weak.
2010 2009 As at 31 December million million 1 Very Strong 3.7 0.2 2 Strong 11.8 6.3 3 Good 8.1 11.3 PSPs amounts due 23.6 17.8 Management consider the maximum credit exposure on amounts due from PSPs to be the carrying amount.
As at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any partially impaired amounts.
There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector.
To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or at least better quality, PSPs.
The table below sets out the movement in the impairment of amounts due from PSPs.
2010 2009 Year ended 31 December million million Impairments 0.1 Total impairment expense 0.1 Note 16 details the movement and level of provisions for PSPs.
Cash investments: Wherever possible and commercially practicable the Group invests cash through major financial institutions where the counterparty has a one year credit default swap CDS as quoted by Bloomberg, of no more than 5% or, in the case of pooled money market funds, a minimum long-term credit rating of AAA on the principal, as defined by Moodys rating agency.
Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities.
The Group maintains monthly operational balances with banks that do not meet this credit rating in Israel, Bulgaria and India to meet local salaries, expenses and legal requirements.
These balances are kept to a minimum.

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.
Interest rate risk The Groups current net cash position is maintained primarily on a floating basis.
In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the Group, the interest rate management policy would be reviewed.
Currency risk Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Groups policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and or by holding cash in the relevant currency.
Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge some or all of its forecast sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months.
No other forecast cashflows are hedged.
The Group also economically hedges material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is short less than one month.
Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a weekly basis.
A $5 million currency tolerance limit between Euros and any other currency is permitted in order to avoid executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
Net investment exposures: The Group has the flexibility to hold debt in currencies other than Euros in order to hedge non-Euro investments up to 50% of the net investment value.
In managing the mix of ongoing debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios.
At 31 December 2010 and at the prior year end the Group had a loan of 35 million.
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Groups financial instruments and any resultant impact on the Groups earnings of either: an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% in market interest rates including the annualised interest income impact of variable rate interest-bearing financial instruments, or a 10% strengthening or weakening in the reporting currency against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December.
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds significant amounts of cash at floating rates as well as cash equivalents to meet client liability obligations that are non-interest bearing.
The Group is exposed to currency movements in the Euro, arising out of changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-Euro currencies.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered as a projection of likely future events and losses.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Prior to the current year both the reporting currency of the Group and functional currency of the majority of subsidiaries was US dollars and currency risk was managed on that basis.

Acquisitions made during the prior year Cashcade On 23 July 2009 the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of Cashcade Limited, an exclusively non-US facing business whose principal activity is the marketing of online bingo and casino and software services.
Cash consideration was an initial 71.9 million paid upon completion and another 6.5 million paid before the year end for the excess working capital acquired.
There was up to 15 million of contingent consideration payable relating to the profit performance in 2009 and a maximum of 9.0 million of contingent consideration payable depending on future profit performance in 2010.
The acquisition was made on a debt-free cash-free basis.

These intangible assets are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of up to five years.
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill are the growth and revenue synergies created by combining business activities and cost savings of the merged operations.
The amount included above for contingent consideration represented the Directors' current best estimate of the amount payable which they consider is likely to be paid, after the effects of discounting.
