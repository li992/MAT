executive Director shareholding guidelines The Groups policy in relation to shareholdings in the Company by Executive Directors is for the Chief Executive to acquire a holding excluding shares held conditionally pursuant to LTIP awards, equivalent in value to 200% of basic salary.
For other Executive Directors, the current policy is to accumulate a holding again excluding shares held conditionally pursuant to LTIP awards, equivalent in value to 100% of basic salary.
The valuation of the respective holdings is made by reference to the closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on the day following the preliminary announcement of the Companys year-end results.
If on that date the valuation of the relevant Directors holding is below the guideline level, then 50% or such lesser percentage as is required to take the relevant Directors holding up to the guideline level, of the bonus payable to that Director in respect of the previous financial year is satisfied by an allocation of shares in the Company held in the ESOT.
Subject to the Directors continued employment within the Group, such shares are transferred to the Director on or around the third anniversary of the original allocation.
