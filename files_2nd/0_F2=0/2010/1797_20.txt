The Group retains a 50% interest in Consort Healthcare Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Holdings Ltd following the transaction.
The aggregate consideration received was 24m.
The disposals resulted in a total gain of 20m being realised, comprising 16m in respect of gains on disposal of the investments in the joint ventures and 4m in respect of revaluation reserves recycled to the income statement.
In 2010, the implementation of the UK shared service centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne led to incremental costs of 12m 2009: nil being incurred prior to it becoming operational.
Post-acquisition integration, reorganisation and other costs of 29m 2009: 12m have been incurred: 23m 2009: 8m relating to Parsons Brinckerhoff, 8m 2009: 2m of which was borne by the Company: 3m 2009: nil relating to various Rok contracts acquired: 2m 2009: 3m relating to Schreck-Mieves: 1m 2009: nil relating to SpawMaxwell: nil 2009: 2m relating to Dean & Dyball: nil 2009: 1m relating to Balfour Beatty Communities formerly GMH Military Housing : nil 2009: 1m relating to Douglas E Barnhart: and nil 2009: 3m gain recognised in relation to the relocation of certain Rail UK businesses.
In 2010, costs of 2m directly attributable to the acquisition of Halsall were incurred.
In 2009, costs of 15m and 1m were directly attributable to the acquisitions of Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc. and Dooley Construction Limited Partnership respectively.
A post-tax impairment charge of 27m 2009: nil was incurred in respect of writing down the value of the assets held by Barking Power Ltd.
The Group has a 25.5% effective interest in Barking Power Ltd.
The impairment has arisen following a detailed assessment of the future earnings of the power station in view of bilateral contracts with power purchasers and gas suppliers which ended in September 2010.
The future cash flows in the impairment model are dependent on future power, gas and carbon prices and exchange rates, all of which are volatile and are based on forecasts provided by an external consultant.
The other principal sensitivity in the impairment model relates to the discount rate applied.
Given the nature of the business and the return an investor would expect from a company with a similar risk profile, a pre-tax discount rate of 11% was applied to the forecast cash flows generated over the remaining 15-year useful life of the power station.
8.2 Due to volatile currency markets, the Group entered into a number of foreign exchange option contracts in 2009 at a cost of 15m to limit the cash outflow for the planned settlement of the Groups foreign exchange contracts in respect of net investment hedging.
8.3 The exceptional items charged against credited to Group operating profit have given rise to a tax credit of 12m 2009: 18m charge.
As a result of the Finance Act 2009, future dividend income from outside the UK is exempt from UK corporation tax which led to the release of 10m of deferred tax in the UK in 2009.
In addition, in 2009 there was a release of 6m of US deferred tax in relation to unremitted earnings where future additional US tax will no longer be incurred.

The calculation of basic earnings is based on profit for the period attributable to equity holders.
The calculation of the weighted average number of ordinary shares was affected by the issue of 205,502,237 ordinary shares on 22 October 2009.
It has been adjusted for the conversion of share options in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share.
No adjustment has been made in respect of the potential conversion of the cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares, the effect of which would have been antidilutive throughout each period.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, before post-tax exceptional items and post-tax amortisation of intangible assets, has been disclosed to give a clearer understanding of the Groups underlying trading performance.
The per share information has been restated for the bonus element of the 2009 rights issue described in Note 28.2.
The adjustment factor has been calculated by dividing the share price immediately before the shares were quoted ex-rights 316.0p with the theoretical ex-rights price 275.2p, giving an adjustment factor of 1.14826.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use.
Cash flow forecasts have been based on the expected workload of each cashgenerating unit CGU giving consideration to the current level of confirmed orders and anticipated orders.
Cash flow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Groups 2011 budget and medium-term performance review.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its revenue growth rate and discount rate.
The revenue growth rate has been applied to cash flows after three years into perpetuity and reflects published GDP growth rates for the economic environment of each CGU.
The cash flows assume a residual value based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate in the range of 11.0%11.7% 2009: 10.6%12.8%.
The discount rates are revised annually applying updated market inputs to the capital asset pricing model.

The major assumptions that result in significant sensitivities are the discount rate and the revenue growth rate.
Except as noted below, a reasonably possible change in a single assumption will not give rise to impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
Balfour Beatty Communities goodwill is 43m and the key assumption is the discount rate of 11.0%, at which the fair value of the CGU exceeds the carrying value by 15m or 7%.
The fair value is equal to the carrying value at a discount rate of 11.5%.

The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury liaises with the Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company: forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the Groups investments in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures: commodity forward contracts to manage the commodity price risk associated with the Groups operational requirements for certain commodities, such as fuel: and interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash flow variability associated with variable interest rates on borrowings in PPP concessions.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages those risks from 2009. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, Euros, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and United Arab Emirate dirhams.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
Group Treasury enters into forward contracts on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above pre-set materiality levels determined by the Finance Director whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identified with sufficient reliability.
Hedge accounting is applied to these transactions above a predetermined materiality level.
Details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures are set out on page 132.
As at 31 December 2010, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was 310m 2009: 72m.
The period during which the cash flows are expected to occur is up to three years.
This will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts against highly probable capital expenditure and inventory sales which are expected to occur in up to three years with a notional principal amount of 23m 2009: 23m as cash flow hedges.
Fair value gains of 2m 2009: 2m gains have been taken to hedging reserves within equity in relation to these contracts.
The cumulative amounts deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges at year end is 2m 2009: nil.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk which has previously been managed by matching significant net assets denominated in currencies other than sterling principally using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically.
During 2009 management amended the policy to reduce the level of net assets hedged taking account of the potential cash effect of the hedging programme against the potential effect of movements in currencies on the Groups net assets.
At 31 December 2010 no foreign currency denominated net assets were hedged 2009: nil.
Annual report and accounts 2010 133 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 20 Financial instruments continued 20.1 Group continued i Foreign currency risk management continued No significant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged to the income statement in relation to any foreign exchange cash flow hedges.
No gain 2009: 1m was recognised in investment income in relation to the forward point fair value movements on net investment hedge contracts.
ii Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk arises in the Groups PPP concessions which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest rates and hold available-for-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Group policy is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, using interest rate swaps, to hedge the cash flow variability of the interest.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the applicable period-end yield curve.
The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.
During 2010 and 2009, the Groups PPP subsidiaries borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding PPP subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2010 were 297m 2009: 269m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 27 years.
At 31 December 2010, the fixed interest rates range from 4.5% to 5.1% 2009: 4.5% to 5.1% and the principal floating rates are LIBOR.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 6m 2009: 12m increase decrease in amounts taken directly by the Group to equity in relation to the Groups exposure to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its PPP subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and non-PPP borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these financial instruments are held would lead to a 3m 2009: 2m increase decrease in the Groups net investment income.
iii Commodity price risk management The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its normal operations.
During 2009 the Group entered into a number of commodity hedge contracts to manage some of the Groups exposure to the price of fuel.
The value of fuel covered by those hedges amounted to 2m 2009: 3m.
These commodity hedge contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges against highly probable future fuel purchases forecast to occur over the next two years.
At 31 December 2010 the fuel hedge contracts had a fair value of nil 2009: nil and no significant gains or losses have been recognised in respect of these contracts in the current or prior periods either in the statement of comprehensive income in respect of the effective portion of the hedge or the income statement in respect of ineffectiveness.
iv Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its PPP concessions.
At the commencement of the concession an element of the unitary payment by the client is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concessions costs.
To the extent that inflation differs from the index used, the Group is exposed to a price risk.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments the Group has a policy of depositing funds only with independently rated counterparties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A.
At 31 December 2010 37m 2009: 27m did not meet this criterion due to the operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances.
No losses are anticipated from non-performance of these counterparties.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
For trade and other receivables credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customers credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Groups most significant customers are public or quasi-public sector entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at 31 December is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 23.1.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out above.
134 Balfour Beatty Our accounts | Auditors report | Financial statements | Notes to the accounts | 20 Financial instruments continued 20.1 Group continued Fair value estimation The Group holds a number of financial instruments on the statement of financial position at their fair values.
The following hierarchy classifies each class of financial asset or liability depending on the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
Level 1: The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group holds available-forsale investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued based on the closing market price at 31 December.
Level 2: The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows utilising applicable year end yield curves.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Level 3: The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the Groups PPP financial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin that reflects the fair value of construction services performed.
In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset at a discount rate which is based on long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets.
The subsequent movement in the fair value is taken to equity.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.

The movement would be taken through equity.
Refer to Note 17 for a reconciliation of the movement of the opening balance to the closing balance.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade and other receivables and payables approximates their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

The Companys external contracts are perfectly matched with derivative contracts issued by the Company to the Groups operating companies.
The Companys financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are the foreign currency contracts shown in the table above.
The fair value of these foreign currency contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Based on the fair value estimation hierarchy mentioned above, the Company derivatives are classified as Level 2.

ii Interest rate risk management A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 3m 2009: 4m decrease increase in the Companys investment income.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries.
There would be no effect on amounts taken directly by the Company to equity.
b Credit risk The additional credit risk that the Company bears is in respect to trade receivables and payables due from to subsidiaries.
There were no amounts past due at the reporting date.
The maximum exposure is the carrying value of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements.

Notes 1.2 and 37.
Based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in respect of trade receivables.
The Directors consider that the carrying values of current trade and other receivables approximate their fair values.
The fair value of non-current trade and other receivables amounts to 68m 2009: 83m and has been determined by discounting future cash flows using yield curves and exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.
It is Group policy that a forward foreign exchange contract is entered into as soon as a trade receivable, above a pre-set materiality level, is identified in a currency other than the operating companys functional currency.
The movement in the provision for impairment of trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2010 2009 m m Balance at 1 January 41 17 Currency translation differences 1 Credited charged to the income statement additional provisions 15 8 unused amounts reversed 6 5 Acquisitions of businesses 23 Used during the year 3 2 Balance at 31 December 48 41 138 Balfour Beatty Our accounts | Auditors report | Financial statements | Notes to the accounts | 21 Trade and other receivables continued The provision for impairment of trade receivables is based on a review of the financial circumstances of individual customers.

2 Act 2010 was substantively enacted on 21 July 2010 implementing a reduction to the main UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011.
The effect of the reduction in the UK tax rate reduced the Groups net deferred tax asset by 4m with 1m being charged to the income statement and 3m being charged to equity.
It was also announced, although not enacted, that there will be a 1% reduction in the main corporation tax rate in each of the three subsequent years to bring the rate down to 24% from 1 April 2014.
Should the future UK corporation tax rate reductions be enacted, based on the latest forecasts, this will give rise to a further reduction in the Groups net deferred tax asset of 12m by 2014 with 2m being charged to the income statement and 10m being charged to reserves.
At the reporting date, the Group had unused tax losses that arose over a number of years of approximately 240m 2009: 260m which are available for offset against future profits.
31m 2009: 50m will expire 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2025.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the reporting date, the undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 850m 2009: 500m and for joint ventures and associates was 95m 2009: 50m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because no temporary difference arises.

Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on employees pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
Defined contribution schemes are those where the Groups obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
The majority of the Groups defined benefit schemes are funded.
Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups main scheme is the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF, which includes defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members with the exception of certain employees transferring under certain agreed arrangements.
During the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group offered certain deferred members of the BBPF enhanced benefits to leave the BBPF and transfer to a freestanding defined contribution scheme.
1,641 deferred members took up the option of the enhanced benefits, resulting in a 42m reduction in assets, a 50m reduction in liabilities and a settlement gain of 8m.
A net gain of 2m was recognised after payments of 6m of enhancements and other expenses.
A formal funding valuation of the BBPF was carried out as at 31 March 2010.
As a result of the funding valuation the Group has agreed to an additional one-off deficit funding payment of 40m, paid in December 2010, and to increase the amount of ongoing deficit payments to the BBPF to 48m per annum, increasing each year by CPI capped at 5% plus 50% of any increase in the Companys dividend in excess of capped CPI.
During 2009 the Group implemented measures to limit the increase in pensionable pay of certain groups of in-service defined benefit members, giving rise to a reduction in past service liabilities of 100m, which was classified as an exceptional item in the income statement in the 2009 annual report.
On 31 May 2009 the Mansell plc Pension Scheme and the Hall & Tawse Retirement Benefit Plan Mansell schemes merged with the BBPF.
The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth to meet, together with any contributions from the Group, the cost of current and future benefits.
The BBPF invests in equities in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will grow in value faster than the liabilities.
The majority of the BBPF equities are in the form of pooled funds.
The BBPF invests in fixed and index-linked bonds and inflation swaps in order to match the duration and inflation exposure of a portion of the liabilities.
The BBPF invests in corporate fixed-interest bonds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will outperform equivalent government bonds.
A portion of the corporate bonds is overlaid with inflation swaps in order to create a better match between the assets and the inflation-linked characteristics of the liabilities.
The performance of equities and bonds is measured against market indices.
The BBPF invests in three funds of hedge funds in order to improve diversification.
The performance of the fund of hedge fund managers is measured against three month LIBOR.
Certain Group employees are members of the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme Railways Pension Scheme, which is closed to new members with the exception of certain employees transferring under certain agreed arrangements.
The economic interest of the Group in this shared cost scheme is approximately 60% of the schemes assets and liabilities, based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing.
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd operates a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new members Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme.
The Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme has a legal charge over a Group leasehold property with a book value of 4m 2009: 4m.
With the exception of the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme, active members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
Other schemes comprise funded and unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which are closed to new entrants, and deferred compensation schemes in the US, where an element of employees compensation is deferred and invested in available-for-sale assets as disclosed in Note 16.1 for the ultimate benefit of the employees in a trust, the assets of which are available to Group creditors in the event of insolvency.
On 30 November 2010 the UK Government published the Occupational Pensions Revaluation Order 2010 which, with effect from 1 January 2011, changed the basis of UK general statutory pension indexation from the retail price index RPI to the consumer price index CPI.
The benefits of certain members of the Groups schemes are defined by reference to the statutory measure of inflation rather than being specifically linked by the scheme rules to RPI.
The consequent change in assumptions gave rise to a 52m 2009: nil actuarial reduction in liabilities which is credited to equity in the statement of comprehensive income.

Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on a high quality corporate bond.
Pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses.
The net finance cost arising from the expected return on plan assets and the interest on scheme obligations is included in finance charges.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
The IAS 19 accounting valuation is set out in 25.2 below.
A different calculation is used for the regular valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme liabilities.
The principal difference between the two methods is that under the funding basis the liabilities are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond as required by IAS 19 for the financial statements.
Details of the latest formal funding basis valuations are set out in 25.3 below.
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Groups financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets of the Group.
The Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme has an interest in a property under an operating lease that is occupied under an operating sublease by a Group company which pays an annual rental of 0.2m 2009: 0.2m.

The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over time.
This research is taken into account in the Groups mortality assumptions across its various defined benefit schemes.
The mortality tables adopted for the 2010 IAS 19 valuations are the SAPS tables with a multiplier of 94% and an improvement rate of 1.5% pa from 2003 to 2010, plus future improvements from 2010 in line with the CMI core projection model applicable to each members year of birth with a long-term rate of 1.5% pa.
The mortality tables adopted for the 2009 IAS 19 valuation are the 1992 series calendar year 2007 tables, with future improvements applicable to each members year of birth under the medium cohort effect from 2007.

The rates of return for each class were determined as follows: equities: the long-term rates of return on equities, funds of hedge funds and property are derived from current risk free rates of return with the addition of an appropriate future risk premium from an analysis of historic returns, current market conditions and forward looking views from market participants: bonds: the rate has been set to reflect the yields available on the gilts and corporate bond holdings held at 31 December: cash and other net assets: this class principally comprises inflation rate swaps and cash holdings and the rate adopted reflects current short-term returns on cash deposits.

During the current and prior year, no preference shares were repurchased for cancellation by the Company.
Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, payable half-yearly.
Any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable on 1 July 2020 at 1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date.
The maximum redemption value of all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was 112m at 31 December 2010 2009: 112m.
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 24.69136 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for a Balfour Beatty plc ordinary share during a 30 day period exceeds 810p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the preference shares or a resolution for the winding-up of the Company.
On a winding-up of the Company, holders are entitled to receive the sum of 1 per preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
The preference shares are a compound instrument, comprising an equity and a liability component.
The fair value of the liability component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% for a similar non-convertible instrument.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in equity holders equity, net of deferred tax.
The liability component recognised in the statement of financial position is calculated as follows: 2010 2009 m m Redemption value of shares in issue at 1 January 112 112 Equity component 16 16 Deferred tax and interest element 8 9 Liability component at 1 January at amortised cost 88 87 Interest accretion 1 1 Liability component at 31 December at amortised cost 89 88 The fair value of the liability component of the preference shares at 31 December 2010 amounted to 147m 2009: 153m.
The fair value is determined by using the market price of the preference shares at the reporting date.
Interest expense on the preference shares is calculated using the effective interest method.

By special resolution on 13 May 2004, confirmed by the court on 16 June 2004, the share premium account was reduced by 181m and the 4m capital redemption reserve was cancelled, effective on 25 June 2004, and a special reserve of 185m was created.
This reserve becomes distributable to the extent of future increases in share capital and share premium account, of which 2m occurred in 2010 2009: 107m.
On 17 September 2009 the Company announced a fully underwritten 3 for 7 rights issue at a subscription price of 180p per new ordinary share to substantially finance the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc.
The rights issue and acquisition were approved by the holders of the Companys ordinary shares at a general meeting on 7 October 2009 and the rights issue closed on 22 October 2009.
205,502,237 new ordinary shares were issued, raising 352m after issue costs and expenses of 18m.
The rights issue utilised a cash box structure and therefore qualified for merger relief under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 so that the premium arising was not required to be credited to the Companys share premium account.
The cash box entity, Bentworth No.
2 Ltd Bentworth 2, issued redeemable preference shares in consideration for the receipt of the cash proceeds net of issue costs arising from the rights issue.
The Companys new ordinary shares were issued as consideration for the transfer to it of the shares in Bentworth 2 which it did not already own.
As a result, the issue qualified for merger relief under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 so that the 252m excess of the value of the acquired shares in Bentworth 2 over the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued by the Company was credited to the Companys merger reserve, which was subsequently charged with 3m of rights issue expenses.
The rights issue was directly associated with the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc. and therefore the merger reserve is not available for distribution to equity holders.
28.3 The retained profits in the Group and the retained profit of the Company are stated net of investments in Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares acquired by the Groups employee discretionary trust, the Balfour Beatty Employee Share Ownership Trust, to satisfy awards under the Balfour Beatty performance share plan and the Balfour Beatty deferred bonus plan.
In 2010, 0.9m 2009: 0.8m shares were purchased at a cost of 2.6m 2009: 3.0m and in 2009 the Trust subscribed 2.7m for 1.5m new shares under the rights issue.
The market value of the 3.7m 2009: 4.2m shares held by the Trust at 31 December 2010 was 11.6m 2009: 10.8m.
The carrying value of these shares is 12.4m 2009: 14.3m.
Following confirmation of the performance criteria at the end of the performance period in the case of the performance share plan, and at the end of the vesting period in the case of the deferred bonus plan, the appropriate number of shares will be unconditionally transferred to participants.
In 2010, 0.9m shares were transferred to participants in relation to the April 2007 awards under the performance share plan 2009: 1.4m shares for the April 2006 awards, and 0.5m shares were transferred to participants in relation to awards under the deferred bonus plan.
The trustees have waived the rights to dividends on shares held by the Trust.
Other reserves in the Group and the Company include 6.4m relating to unvested performance share plan awards 2009: 6.4m, 5.2m relating to unvested share options 2009: 5.9m, and 4.3m relating to unvested deferred bonus plan awards 2009: 3.8m.

30 Share-based payments The Company operates four equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, namely the savings-related share option scheme SAYE, the executive share option scheme ESOS, the performance share plan PSP and the deferred bonus plan DBP.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions since 7 November 2002 of 8.3m in 2010 2009: 6.8m.
Refer to the Remuneration report for details of the various schemes and to Note 27.1 for details of SAYE options granted during the year.

The principal assumptions, including expected volatility determined from the historic weekly share price movements over the three year period immediately preceding the award date, used by the consultants in the stochastic model for the 50% of the PSP awards in 2010 subject to market conditions, were: Closing share Expected Calculated price before volatility of Expected term Risk-free fair value award date shares of awards interest rate of an award Award date Pence % Years % Pence 15 April 2010 303.1 33.4 3.0 1.79 174.9 For the 50% of the PSP awards in 2010 subject to non-market conditions and for the DBP awards in 2010, the fair value of the awards is the closing share price before award date.
31 Commitments Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for which has not been provided for in the accounts amounted to 31m 2009: 29m in the Group and nil 2009: nil in the Company.
The Group has committed to provide its share of further equity funding and subordinated debt of joint ventures and associates in PPP projects amounting to 70m 2009: 104m, 21m 2009: 30m in respect of PPP subsidiaries and 24m 2009: 23m in respect of Balfour Beatty Communities military housing concessions.

Where the Company enters into such agreements, it considers them to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
Guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantee.
An associate is a member of a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan where there is insufficient information on which to base a reliable estimate of any potential defined benefit obligation and accordingly the associate is accounting for the plan as a defined contribution plan.
Under certain circumstances it is possible that additional contributions may be made to fund the deficit attributable to the associate, however no reliable estimate can be made of whether and to what extent a liability may crystallise.
As stated in Note 26, provision has been made for the Directors best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed, or that a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
33 Related party transactions Joint ventures and associates The Group has contracted with, provided services to, and received management fees from, certain joint ventures and associates amounting to 972m 2009: 939m.
These transactions occurred in the normal course of business at market rates and terms.
In addition, the Group procured equipment and labour on behalf of certain joint ventures and associates which were recharged at cost with no mark-up.
The amounts due to or from joint ventures and associates at 31 December are disclosed within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables in Notes 21 and 22 respectively.
Pension schemes The Group recharged the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund with the costs of administration and advisers fees borne by the Group amounting to 5.2m in 2010 2009: 5.0m.

34 Post balance sheet events On 2 March 2011 the Directors resolved to dispose of the Groups effective 25.5% interest in Barking Power Ltd Barking, subject to receiving a satisfactory offer.
Barkings carrying value is expected to be recovered principally through a sale transaction within one year rather than through continuing use and accordingly, from 2 March 2011, the Groups interest in Barking will be classified as held for sale.

Project descriptions: The road projects comprise the design, construction, operation, maintenance and associated financing of the following roads: the M1-A1 link road: A30 Honiton to Exeter and A35 Tolpuddle to Puddletown bypass: A50 Stoke-Derby: M77 Fenwick to Malletsheugh and the Glasgow Southern Orbital: the M25 Junction 16 to Junction 23, Junction 27 to Junction 30 and A1 M Hatfield Tunnel and maintenance of the entire M25: and the Carlisle Northern Development Route CNDR.
The road concessions typically run for 30 years and reached financial close at various dates between March 1996 and July 2009.
The street lighting projects are for the replacement, maintenance and associated financing over a 25-year period of the street lighting and highway signs in Sunderland, South Tyneside, Derby and Coventry.
All construction is new build rather than refurbishment except for the work undertaken on the M25 and A1 M Hatfield Tunnel.
Contractual arrangements: The principal contract in the roads concessions is the project agreement with the governmental highway authority setting out the obligations for the construction, operation and maintenance of the roads including lifecycle replacement by Connect for the life of the concession to specified standards.
In the case of M1-A1, A30 A35 and A50 the inflation indexed payment is related to traffic volumes.
In the case of M77 GSO and CNDR, the inflation indexed payment is partly based on availability and partly on traffic volumes, and is subject to any performance related deductions.
In the case of M25, the inflation indexed payment is wholly based on availability and is subject to any performance related deductions.
Construction of the roads was subcontracted to construction joint ventures in which Balfour Beatty had a 50% interest or, in the case of the M77 GSO and CNDR, 100% to Balfour Beatty subsidiaries.

Annual report and accounts 2010 165 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 36 Principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates continued e Balfour Beatty Communities PPP concessions Military housing Summary: Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number of US military privatisation projects associated with a total of 43 military bases that provide speciality housing to US military personnel and their families.
Project descriptions: The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army Army, covering 16 Army bases: four projects with the United States Department of the Air Force Air Force, covering nine Air Force bases and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy Navy, covering 18 Navy bases.
In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing UPH project at Fort Stewart, located in Hinesville, Georgia.
These projects in operation cover 43 domestic bases located in 20 states and Washington, DC and Balfour Beatty Communities expects them to contain approximately 33,000 end-state housing units once full development, construction and renovation have been completed.
The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years.
For each project, Balfour Beatty Communities creates a special purpose entity to serve as the owner of the project, which is typically either a limited liability company or general partnership.
With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity Project LLC : and, whereas the Air Force is not a named partner or member in Balfour Beatty Communities Project LLCs, it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the Project LLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC.
Contractual arrangements: On each project, the Project LLC enters into a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 years.
Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management, renovation, and development of existing housing units, as well as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, potentially could extend for up to an additional 25 years.
The 50 year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units.
At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLCs leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the US Government.
Preferred returns: The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual, minimum preferred rate of return.
On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities initial equity contribution to the project.
During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return.
The unpaid amounts generally will accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and construction costs, if necessary.
If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, at the end of the initial development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the US Government in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.
Split of remaining operating cash flows: Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash flow remaining after the annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities and the reinvestment account held by the project for the benefit of the US Government.
On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty Communities is entitled to receive inclusive of the preferred return is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, on its initial equity contribution to the project.
Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately 9% to 18% depending on the particular project and the type of return annual modified rates of return or cash-on-cash.
However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return.
The total capped return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above.
The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military branch.
Return of equity: Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable, in a predetermined order of priority.
Typically these distributions will have the effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and a complete return of the initial capital contribution.
After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a partys initial contribution, all remaining funds will typically be distributed to the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable.
