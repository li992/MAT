The equity issue was completed on 4 November 2009 and the amended financing facilities came into effect on 16 November 2009.
As a consequence of amending its financing arrangements, as described in note 23, the Company incurred various fees, costs and other expenses.
The amendment and other fees and costs were 24.2m, with 6.7m being charged to the income statement during the year and 17.5m being amortised over the life of the amended facilities.
As a consequence of the part prepayment of the WB Acquisition Facilities as described in note 23, the Company made prepayment offers to each of the private placement noteholders, including make-whole amounts in respect of the private placement notes which were the subject of the prepayment offer.
The noteholders had the option to receive a cash payment in satisfaction of the make-whole obligation instead of make-whole notes.
Cash payments in respect of the make-whole amounts of 4.9m were made to certain noteholders and make-whole notes of 19.0m were issued to the remaining noteholders.
The total charge recognised in the income statement in relation to the make-whole payments and notes was 23.9m.
Interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps with contracted amounts of 285.0m and 51.5m respectively were cancelled during the year ended 30 June 2010 following the Placing and the Rights Issue and prepayment of part of the Groups borrowings.

The remaining fair value uplift of 0.2m in respect of the private placement notes was also credited to the income statement on 16 November 2009.
The total income statement charge in the year relating to the amended financing arrangements was 114.1m.

The Finance No 2 Act 2010, which was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, includes legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
If it had been enacted at the balance sheet date, the effect of the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% contained in the Finance No 2 Act 2010, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset recognised at 30 June 2010 by approximately 6.2m.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 24% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
If the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 2014, the effect of the changes from 28% to 24% would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by 24.8m.
To the extent that the deferred tax reverses more quickly than this, the impact on the net deferred tax asset will be reduced.

The goodwill relating to the commercial developments segment, with cost of 24.5m, was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments segments.
The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2010 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying-value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.
The Group allocates any identified impairment first to goodwill and then to assets on a pro-rata basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment.
The first three years of cash flows were determined using the Groups approved detailed site-by-site business plan.
The cash flows for the fourth and fifth years were determined using Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases and work in progress levels.
The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were: Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Groups housebuilding business.
Accordingly the rate of 11.3% 2009: 8.9% is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate being the Groups estimated long-term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
This rate is calculated using the current capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date.
Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon local market conditions and product type.
For years four and five these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability and planning permissions.
Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first three years dependent upon the expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual development including any additional costs that are expected to occur due to the business being on an individual development site for longer due to current market conditions.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups goodwill related to the housebuilding segment was not impaired.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 June 2010 was based upon current expectations regarding sales volumes, expected changes in selling prices and site costs to complete in the uncertain conditions within the UK housing market and used a discount rate considered appropriate to the position and risks of the Group.
The result of the impairment review, which was based upon the capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date, was that the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying-value by 707.5m 2009: 2,932.7m.
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reducing by 2.3% per annum 2009: 7.8% per annum or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 1.5% 2009: 4.7% and all other variables were held constant then the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying-value.

The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
At 30 June 2010 an impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 10.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments valued at 7.0m prior to amortisation was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business brand operating in niche markets.
Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.

These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment.
The income statement includes a net impairment of 6.1m 2009: 23.7m in cost of sales.
The impairment of available for sale financial assets arises due to the impact on the fair value of these assets of the decline in UK house prices.

Deferred tax continued It is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of brands will reverse in the twelve months following the balance sheet date.
Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the twelve months following the balance sheet date, at present it is not possible to quantify the value of these reversals.
In addition to the above, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset of 3.3m 2009: 2.9m in respect of capital and other losses because these are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
Barratt Developments plc AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2010 finAnciAl stAtements 89 17. inventories continued b impairment of inventories At 30 June 2010 the Group reviewed the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying-values of its sites.
The impairment review compared the estimated future net present realisable value of development sites with their balance sheet carrying-value.
This review resulted in no impairment charge for the housebuilding business 2009: 431.5m, although there were gross impairment reversals and charges of 57.4m due to performance variances upon housebuilding sites 2009: 120.9m.
There was an impairment of 4.8m for the commercial developments business 2009: 68.0m, leading to a total net impairment during the year of 4.8m 2009: 499.5m.
The key judgements in estimating the realisable value of a site were the estimation of likely sales prices and estimated costs to complete.
Sales prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and took into account the current prices being achieved upon each site for each product type.
In addition, the estimation of future sales prices included an allowance on a site-by-site basis for low single digit sales price inflation in future periods.
The estimation of costs to complete also included an allowance for low single digit build costs inflation in future periods.
Whilst the UK housing market has seen some recovery during the year, if it were to change beyond management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around likely sales prices and estimated costs to complete, then further adjustments to the carrying-value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following these impairments 1,208.1m 2009: 1,460.5m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
c expensed inventories The value of inventories expensed in 2010 and included in cost of sales was 1,735.2m 2009: 2,009.8m including 13.0m 2009: 20.8m of inventory write-downs incurred in the course of normal trading and a reversal of 1.9m 2009: nil on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period, but excluding the 4.8m 2009: 499.5m exceptional impairment.
During the year, average selling prices across the Groups developments were in-line with those incorporated into the impairment review at 30 June 2009 and therefore overall no further impairment was required in the housebuilding business, although there were gross impairment reversals and charges of 57.4m due to performance variances upon housebuilding sites.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2010 totalled 17.8m 2009: 520.3m, being the 4.8m 2009: 499.5m classified as an exceptional cost and the remaining 13.0m 2009: 20.8m incurred in the normal course of trading.
d company The Company has no inventories.

These swaps reduced the cash interest payable by the Group by 1.4m over the six-month life.
There were no basis rate swaps outstanding as at 30 June 2009 or 30 June 2010. c foreign exchange swaps The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign exchange arising from the Groups sources of finance denominated in US Dollars.

The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group treasury policy outlined in note 25.
The hedges match the contractual initial receipt, the final settlement, and as a result of refinancing on 9 July 2008 match 76% of the interest payments.
The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2010, which is based on third party valuations, was an asset of 32.2m 2009: 30.5m with a gain of 13.6m 2009: 30.3m credited directly to equity in the year.

Barratt Developments plc AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2010 finAnciAl stAtements 101 25. financial risk management The principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 26 and 27.
The Groups financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 22, 23 and 24.
The Groups operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management with the goal of ensuring that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department.
These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board.
The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.
a liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
The Groups borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May, and October and November, of each year, due to seasonal trends in income.
Accordingly the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements.
On a normal operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of up to 250.0m.
The Group identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations.
At 30 June 2010, the Groups debt drawn against these facilities was 930.1m 2009: 1,484.1m.
This represented 57.6% of available committed facilities at 30 June 2010 2009: 65.0%.
In addition the Group had 546.5m 2009: 178.8m of cash.
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2010.
At the date of approval of the financial statements the Groups internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
Compliance with covenants is also considered on page 61.
The Groups objective is to minimise refinancing risk.
The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years.
At 30 June 2010, the average maturity of the Groups committed facilities was 2.6 years 2009: 3.1 years.
The Group maintains certain committed floating rate facilities with banks to ensure sufficient liquidity for its operations.
The undrawn committed facilities available to the Group, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows: Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 Expiry date m m m m In less than one year 50.0 50.0 In more than one year but not more than two years In more than two years but not more than five years 700.0 750.0 700.0 750.0 700.0 800.0 700.0 800.0 Barratt Developments plc AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2010 102 financial statements notes to the financial statements 25. financial risk management continued a liquidity risk continued In addition, the Group had 61.2m of undrawn uncommitted facilities available at 30 June 2010 2009: 68.8m.

b market risk price risk i uK housing market risk This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Groups earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices.
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage availability and competitor pricing.
However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions.
The Group has detailed procedures to manage its market related operational risks which include: a weekly review of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash flow projections: the provision to mortgage providers with complete transparency of house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision: and collaboration with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for its customers.

The Groups financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market are as follows: Linked to UK Not linked to housing UK housing market market Total Group m m m 30 June 2010 Non-derivative financial assets 136.3 582.4 718.7 Non-derivative financial liabilities 2,036.6 2,036.6 Derivatives 39.7 39.7 136.3 1,493.9 1,357.6 30 June 2009 Non-derivative financial assets 86.5 195.3 281.8 Non-derivative financial liabilities 2,369.8 2,369.8 Derivatives 57.3 57.3 86.5 2,231.8 2,145.3 The value of the Groups available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market.
At 30 June 2010 these assets were carried at a fair value of 136.3m 2009: 86.5m.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market.
sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2010, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial assets and liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by 5.2m 2009: 6.2m with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
ii interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility for the Groups operational requirements.
The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated private placements.

At 30 June 2010, 70.4% of the Groups borrowings was at a fixed rate 2009: 68.4%.
The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Group m m m m 30 June 2010 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 727.2 202.9 1,106.5 2,036.6 Impact of interest rate swaps 480.0 480.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 247.2 682.9 1,106.5 2,036.6 30 June 2009 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,209.4 274.7 885.7 2,369.8 Impact of interest rate swaps 765.0 765.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 444.4 1,039.7 885.7 2,369.8 The exposure of the Companys financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Company m m m m 30 June 2010 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 832.0 202.9 29.7 1,064.6 Impact of interest rate swaps 480.0 480.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 352.0 682.9 29.7 1,064.6 30 June 2009 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 1,312.7 274.7 33.2 1,620.6 Impact of interest rate swaps 765.0 765.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 547.7 1,039.7 33.2 1,620.6 Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates.
The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2010 was 3.2% 2009: 6.6%.
Sterling private placement notes of 77.8m 2009: 114.2m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate Sterling private placement notes for 2010 was 11.8% 2009: 11.5% with, at 30 June 2010, a weighted average period of 7.7 years 2009: 8.5 years for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of 125.1m 2009: 164.9m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2010 was 11.2% 2009: 11.0% with, at 30 June 2010, a weighted average period of 6.8 years 2009: 7.8 years for which the rate is fixed.

iii foreign exchange rate risk As at 30 June 2010, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $187.2m 2009: $271.6m.
In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and a significant proportion of the interest payments.
The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges.
Accordingly the Group has no net exposure to foreign currency risk on the principal of its US Dollar debt.
The foreign exchange swaps match 76% of the interest payments and therefore the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risk upon the remaining 24%.
Details of the Groups foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 24. sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2010, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax loss would increase decrease by 0.4m 2009: 0.7m, the Groups post-tax loss would increase decrease by 0.3m 2009: 0.5m and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 0.3m 2009: 0.5m.
c credit risk In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered Social Landlords for social housing.
The Group has 136.3m 2009: 86.5m of available for sale financial assets which expose it to credit risk, although this asset is spread over a large number of properties.
As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways: The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies and has a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement in place.
These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Groups credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2010 was 100.0m of cash on deposit with a financial institution 2009: 31.0m.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
As at 30 June 2010, the Company was exposed to 898.5m 2009: 1,511.1m of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, as well as financial guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings.
Further details are provided in notes 32 and 33.

The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in the condensed consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity, its bank borrowings being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans and its private placement notes, as set out in note 23.
The management of these operational risks is set out in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 26 and 27.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders assuming the Company is paying a dividend, issuing new share capital, arranging debt to meet liability payments, and selling assets to reduce debt.

defined benefit scheme The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme which is closed to new entrants.
With effect from 30 June 2009, the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions for current employees and the link between accrued benefits and future salary increases was removed.
This decision was taken following a detailed consultation process with the Trustees and employee members of the Scheme.
Alternative defined contribution pension arrangements are in place for current employees.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 November 2007 and updated to 30 June 2010 by a qualified independent actuary.
The projected unit method has been used to calculate the current service cost.
Due to the Scheme ceasing to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions to employees from 30 June 2009, there is no current service cost in the year or in future years.
Following the completion of the Scheme triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes, the Group has agreed to make future contributions to the Scheme, in addition to the normal contribution payment, of 13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015 to address the Schemes deficit and the Group will also meet the Schemes administration expenses, death in service premiums and Pension Protection Fund levy.
The next triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes is due with effect from 30 November 2010.
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 1.1m 2009: 0.4m.
Barratt Developments plc AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2010 108 financial statements notes to the financial statements 26. retirement benefit obligations continued The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair bid value.
The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions: Principal actuarial assumptions 2010 2009 Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations Discount rate 5.40% 6.30% Rate of compensation increase N A 4.40% Rate of price inflation 3.20% 3.40% Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost Discount rate 6.30% 6.30% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.31% 6.82% Rate of compensation increase N A 4.70% Rate of price inflation 3.40% 3.70% Members are assumed to exchange 10% of their pension for cash on retirement.
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, the Groups actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities: Assumptions Male Female Retired member born in 1935 life expectancy at age 65 21.5 years 24.6 years Non-retired member born in 1965 life expectancy at age 65 24.4 years 27.8 years The base mortality assumptions are based upon the PA92 mortality tables.
The Group has carried out a mortality investigation of the Schemes membership to ensure that this is an appropriate assumption.
Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the medium cohort projection, with an underpin on the annual rate of improvement in mortality of 1%.

During the year, 55,240 shares were issued to satisfy early exercises under the 2009 SAYE Scheme.
On 19 October 2009 the Company issued 72,916,666 new ordinary shares by way of a Placing at 240 pence per share.
On 19 October 2009 the Company provisionally allotted 545,525,090 new ordinary shares in respect of a 1.3 for 1 Rights Issue at a price of 100 pence per share.
This allotment was subsequently confirmed on the closing of the Rights Issue.

After costs of 27.5m the Placing and the Rights Issue generated net proceeds to the Company of 693.0m.
The Barratt Developments PLC Employee Benefit Trust the EBT holds 3,929,314 2009: 1,711,046 ordinary shares in the Company.
During the year the EBT participated in the Rights Issue and consequently purchased 2,224,359 ordinary shares for 2,224,359.
The cost of the shares held by the EBT, at an average of 128.8 pence per share 2009: 165.9 pence per share was 5,062,765 2009: 2,838,386.

The grant of share options under the ESOP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOP is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee, namely that the growth in the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998, and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.
No options may be granted under the ESOP after 18 December 2007. ii employee share option plan In November 1999, the Company adopted an Employee Share Option Plan the Employee Plan.
The Board approves the grant of share options to employees under this Employee Plan which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The exercise of the options granted under the Employee Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Board, namely that the growth in the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 9%.
No options may be granted under the Employee Plan after 10 April 2010.
Those who have participated in the Executive Share Option Plan do not participate in the Employee Share Option Plan.
iii long-term performance plan The Long-Term Performance Plan the LTPP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect from 1 July 2003.
No LTPP awards were granted in the financial year ended 30 June 2009 or 30 June 2010.
The Committee is proposing to use the LTPP in the year ending 30 June 2011.
Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
An employee is not eligible to receive options under the ESOS and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year.
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets.
There is no re-testing of performance conditions.
50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth.
The Committee considers these targets to be the most appropriate measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of the awards, as they are fundamental measures of the Groups underlying performance and are directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
For awards made in 2007, the comparator group for the TSR portion of the award comprises those companies, excluding investment trusts, ranked 51-100 in the FTSE Index.
For the TSR element of the award, 50% of the total award will vest if the Companys TSR measured over a three-year period ranks at the upper quartile or above against the TSR of the comparator group.
10% of the total award will vest if the TSR ranks at the median and no part of the award will vest if the TSR ranks below the median.
The award will vest on a straight-line basis between the upper and lower targets.

The EPS for the Company is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
iv senior management share option plan In December 2009, the Company adopted the Senior Management Share Option Plan 2009-2012 the Plan.
The Board approves the grant of share options to employees under the Plan which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant, provided the employee remains employed by the Company.
It is intended that the grant of options under the Plan will be a one-off event and those who participate in the Plan are not eligible to participate in the Long-Term Performance Plan or Executive Share Option Scheme, therefore Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan.
v executive share option scheme In November 2008, the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Scheme the ESOS.
The grant of share options under the ESOS is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee, which for options granted in 2008 was based upon Return On Capital Employed ROCE.
There will be no opportunity to retest any performance criteria.
The ROCE performance condition is underpinned by the requirement that the Committee is satisfied that vesting determined by the ROCE condition is such that it correctly reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company across the performance period.
For options granted in 2008, 100% of the option will vest if the ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2011 reaches 14.5%, 25% of the award will vest if the ROCE reaches 10.5% and no part of the award will vest if the ROCE is below 10.5%.
ROCE will be calculated as operating profit measured across the whole year to 30 June 2011 divided by shareholder funds plus net debt less any intangible assets being the average of the 12 month end figures during the same year.
The Committee considered that ROCE was the most rounded measure of financial performance for a housebuilder at the time of this award and was satisfied that the ROCE target range represented a stretching target considering the outlook for the housebuilding market.

Under the SRSOS, participants are required to make monthly contributions to an HM Treasury approved savings contract with a bank or building society for a period of three years.
On entering into the savings contract participants were granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price determined under the rules of the SRSOS.
The exercise of options under the SRSOS is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition as the SRSOS is HM Revenue and Customs approved and open to all eligible employees.
The first grant under the SRSOS was made on 3 February 2009 at an exercise price of 87.05 pence per share which was subsequently adjusted to reflect the Rights Issue to 57.05 pence.
The second grant under the SRSOS was made on 31 March 2010 at an exercise price of 116.18 pence per share.
vii management incentive plan In May 2009, the Company adopted the Management Incentive Plan 2008-2011 the Plan.
The Plan entitles participants to a cash bonus linked to the Companys share price, subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee, based upon ROCE for the financial year ending 30 June 2011.
viii co-investment plan The Co-Investment Plan the Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2005 and any annual bonus earned above target will normally be compulsorily deferred into shares held under this Plan.
The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan.
Matching awards will then be made by the Company, at the rate of one for one for compulsory deferral and at a maximum of four for one for voluntary deferral: matching awards will be subject to performance conditions measured over a period of three years.
The relevant performance conditions are the same as those used for the LTPP as detailed on page 113.

i incident at Battersea park Road, london One of the principal subsidiaries within the Group is BDW Trading Ltd BDW.
On Tuesday 26 September 2006 at Battersea Park Road, London, a tower crane supplied to BDW with operator by a third party contractor collapsed.
The collapse of the crane was not contained within the boundaries of the site and the crane operator and a member of the public were killed.
In addition, significant damage was caused to a neighbouring block of flats and shops which resulted in the evacuation of a number of local residents due to concerns about structural stability.
There is an ongoing criminal investigation currently being carried out by the London Metropolitan Police and the Health and Safety Executive to ascertain whether any of the parties involved are criminally liable for manslaughter or under relevant health and safety legislation.
Although no assurance can be given, the Board has been advised that on the information available as at 7 September 2010, being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual Report and Accounts, the risk of a finding of criminal liability against BDW is low.
A number of civil claims brought against BDW in connection with the same incident have now been settled.
All such claims are covered by the Groups insurance, to the extent not recoverable from the third party contractors insurers.
ii incident at Bedfont Azure lakes On 28 February 2008, a resident was found dead and another seriously injured in housing association accommodation at the Bedfont Lakes, Azure site that was developed by BDW.
It is believed that the cause of both the death and the serious injury was due to carbon monoxide poisoning.
Following investigations by the Police and the Health and Safety Executive criminal proceedings have been commenced against both the plumbing and heating sub-contractor utilised by BDW for the development for a breach of health and safety legislation, and against an individual registered gas engineer for manslaughter caused by gross negligence and breach of gas safety legislation.
The Police and Health and Safety Executive investigations are still ongoing.
Claims have been made against BDW by both the housing association and by various residents on the estate where the incident occurred.
A number of claims have been settled by the Groups insurers but the remainder are still outstanding and are being dealt with by the Groups insurers, although the extent to which these are covered by the Groups insurance or the insurance of other parties cannot, at present, be clearly ascertained.
