qxd 22 7 10 5:15 pm Page 8 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2010 Chairmans Statement continued As in the previous year, the surplus on disposals of 5.1 million 2009 6.7 million relates almost entirely to the sale of residential lease extensions in the UK.
Administration expenses at 10 million are 2 million lower than in 2009 due to the non recurrence of significant costs related to the settlement of a long running tenant dispute and the corporate restructuring referred to in my statement last year.
The level of residential voids has remained steady during the year: commercial voids have continued to edge upwards reflecting the difficult economic conditions.
Re-letting activity has continued at levels consistent with previous years.
Dividend Despite the climate of economic uncertainty, our core rental business remains robust and this gives your Board the confidence to recommend an increase in the total dividend for the year to 74p 2009 73p.
Balance Sheet At 31 March 2010 shareholders funds stood at 785.0 million 2009 759.3 million.
This is equivalent to 48.17 per share 2009 46.60.
