Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a number of financial risks including market risk principally foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
These risks are managed by a centralised treasury department, in accordance with Board approved objectives, policies and authorities.
Regular reports monitor exposures and assist in managing the associated risks.
Market Risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The principal exposures arise with respect to the US dollar against the Pound sterling.
To mitigate risks associated with future commercial transactions the Group policy is to hedge known, and certain forecast transaction exposures based on historical experience and projections.
The Group hedges at least 70% of the next 12 months anticipated exposure and can hedge up to five years ahead.
The Group uses borrowings denominated in the relevant currencies to hedge its investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Details of the hedges in place can be found in note 31.
Interest rate risk The Group has borrowings issued at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk whereas floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to maintain at least 25% of its net debt at fixed rates.
The Group mitigates interest rate risks through swaps which have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings and floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings.
Details of the hedges in place can be found in note 31. Credit risk The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a large number of companies across the world.
In addition, many of the Groups principal customers are either government departments or large multinationals.
Policies are maintained to ensure the Group makes sales to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Letters of credit or other appropriate instruments are put in place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary.
The Group is also subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its other financial instruments which it controls through only dealing with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement wherever possible.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains sufficient committed facilities to meet projected borrowing requirements based on cash flow forecasts.
Additional headroom is maintained to protect against the variability of cash flows and to accommodate small bolt-on acquisitions.
Key ratios are monitored to ensure continued compliance with covenants contained in the Groups principal credit agreements.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows: 2010 Less than 1-2 years 2-5 years Greater than Total 1 year 5 years m m m m m Trade and other payables 249.9 1.4 5.7 0.7 257.7 Bank and other borrowings 9.1 204.2 161.1 384.0 758.4 Interest payments on borrowings 27.9 27.6 66.0 81.2 202.7 Obligations under finance leases see note 28 0.8 1.4 2.5 4.7 Derivative financial instruments: Inflows 8.8 8.9 26.9 41.8 86.4 Outflows 8.9 5.0 13.9 Total 287.8 230.7 208.4 424.1 1,151.0 2009 Less than 1-2 years 2-5 years Greater than Total 1 year 5 years m m m m m Trade and other payables 239.2 1.8 6.7 0.7 248.4 Bank and other borrowings 8.2 1.3 813.2 44.7 867.4 Interest payments on borrowings 8.9 8.4 16.1 1.2 34.6 Obligations under finance leases see note 28 0.8 1.4 3.2 5.4 Derivative financial instruments: Inflows 0.2 0.2 Outflows 22.7 8.8 4.9 36.4 Total 279.6 21.7 844.1 46.6 1,192.0 Assumes no change in interest rates from those prevailing at year end.

Financial risk management continued Sensitivity analysis The Groups principal exposures in relation to market risks are to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and Pound sterling and to changes in US interest rates.
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Groups results to changes in these key variables as at the balance sheet date.
The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date and is made on the basis of the hedge designations in place on the relative dates and assuming no hedge ineffectiveness.
2010 2009 Income Equity Income Equity statement statement m m m m USD GBP exchange rate - 5% 9.3 27.4 8.8 35.5 US yield curve - 1% 4.8 21.6 4.6 6.8 Of the impact on equity from movements in the exchange rate, 31.0 million 2009: 36.7 million relates to net US dollar debt.
However, as all US dollar debt is designated as a net investment hedge, the impact is entirely offset by the retranslation of overseas operations.
Capital risk management The Groups objective when managing its capital structure is to minimise the cost of capital while maintaining adequate capital to protect against volatility in earnings and net asset values.
The strategy is designed to maximise shareholder return over the long-term.
The relative proportion of debt to equity will be adjusted over the medium-term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the industry and the Group.
The Groups committed credit facilities contain two principal financial covenants.
The Group has complied with these covenant requirements for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Further details on the covenant requirements and the Groups performance against these can be found on pages 27 and 28 of the Performance Review.
The capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Obligations under finance leases current see note 28 0.8 0.8 Bank and other borrowings current see note 29 12.7 9.7 Obligations under finance leases non-current see note 28 3.9 4.6 Bank and other borrowings non-current see note 29 755.9 856.4 Less cash and cash equivalents see note 25 51.9 62.9 Total net debt 721.4 808.6 Total equity 1,438.2 1,273.6 Debt equity % 50.2% 63.5% 4.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements In applying the Groups accounting policies set out in note 2 management is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning the future.
These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.
The estimates and judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Goodwill Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill balances which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating units CGUs.
These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of the future cash flows and long-term growth rates of the CGUs.
Further details on these estimates are provided in note 19.
Development costs and programme participation costs The Group capitalises development costs and programme participation costs provided they meet certain criteria.
Costs are only capitalised where management are satisfied as to the ultimate commercial viability of the project based on available information.
Projects typically involve long-term relationships on aircraft platforms and, in assessing commercial viability, estimates need to be made of future revenues, margins and cash flows which are dependent on a number of factors including the size, utilisation and life of the aircraft fleet to which the capitalised costs relate.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination On the acquisition of a business it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible assets acquired provided they meet the criteria to be recognised.
The fair values of these intangible assets are dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, margins and cash flows.
Income taxes In determining the Groups provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Environmental matters The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of certain sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under US law.
Advice is received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisors to assist in the determination of the timing and estimation of the costs that the Group may incur in respect of such claims and an appropriate provision is made.
To the extent these estimates change as more information becomes available adjustments are made to the carrying value of the provision.
The Group has extensive insurance arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of historical environmental events on the Group.
Legal and regulatory The Group is subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
A determination of the amount of reserves required for these matters is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel.
However, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates.
Retirement benefit obligations The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, inflation, salary increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted.
Any change in these assumptions would impact the retirement benefit obligations recognised.
Further details on these estimates are provided in note 34.
Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Sale of goods 1,065.0 1,040.5 Contract accounting revenue 38.8 48.8 Revenue from services 41.5 42.0 Revenue from funded research and development 16.7 19.2 Total 1,162.0 1,150.5 6.
Segmental analysis As part of the transformation programme see note 11, the Group has created five new divisions.
Results are reported in 2010 under this new segmental structure, in line with the format now reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Comparative segmental information for 2009 has been restated in line with the new segmental structure.

I n 2009, in response to the economic downturn, the Group commenced a transformation programme involving reductions in factory direct and indirect headcount and related costs arising from volume reductions, transforming the way the business is managed, effectively removing a layer of management, freezing executive pay and reducing pension and other benefits.
The programme continued to make good progress during 2010 exceeding the targeted annual run-rate savings of 50.0 million by the end of the year.
Further savings have been identified in 2011 with an increased annual run-rate target of 57.0 million set for the end of 2011.
Total costs of achieving the 57.0 million savings are expected to be approximately 35.0 million.
Costs associated with the programme are treated as an exceptional operating item.
Costs were incurred during 2010 in completing the integration of K & F, with final savings of 22.1 million delivered.

2 Act 2010 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax in the UK from 28% to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011.
Further reductions are proposed to reduce the main rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
The legislation to reduce the main tax rate to 27% is reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010.
The impact on net deferred tax liabilities as at 31 December 2010, profit for the year underlying and statutory and other comprehensive income for the year has not been significant.
As the further reductions to the main rate of UK corporation tax have not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, their impact is not reflected in these financial statements.

Profit of parent company The profit attributable to the shareholders of Meggitt PLC includes a profit, after dividends received, of 86.5 million 2009: 132.0 million which has been dealt with in the accounts of that Company.
Meggitt PLC, which prepares its accounts in accordance with UK GAAP, has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a separate profit and loss account.
Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per ordinary share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes 0.6 million shares 2009: Nil being the weighted average number of own shares bought by the Group and held during the year by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust see note 37.
The calculation of diluted EPS adjusts the weighted average number of shares to reflect the assumption that all potentially dilutive ordinary shares convert.
For the Group this means assuming all share options and equity-settled share appreciation rights in issue are exercised.

No impairment charge was required in the year 2009: Nil and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date is Nil 2009: Nil.
For the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs which principally comprise its individual business operations.
The allocation of goodwill to CGUs is initially carried out in the year a business is acquired according to those CGUs which are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent operations to which goodwill relates are transferred between CGUs.
An analysis of goodwill by principal CGU is shown below: 2010 2009 m m Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems MABS 697.5 679.6 Meggitt North Hollywood Inc formerly Whittaker Controls Inc 171.7 166.5 Meggitt Rockmart Inc formerly Engineering Fabrics Corporation 72.5 70.3 Meggitt Training Systems Inc 66.6 64.6 Other 287.2 280.9 Total 1,295.5 1,261.9 For each acquired CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount from value in use calculations.
The value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and plans for the next five years, as approved by management in December 2010.
Cash flows for periods beyond five years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are shown below: Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the five years covered by managements detailed plans.
Sales volumes are based on industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates including forecasts for OEM deliveries of large jets, regional aircraft and business jets: air traffic growth and military spending by the US DoD and other major governments.
Sales prices and cost increases are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market.
Overall a cautious approach to volume levels, selling prices and cost increases has been taken given the current global economic uncertainty.
The extent to which these assumptions affect each CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.
MABS and Meggitt North Hollywood Inc are broadly spread across both civil aerospace and military platforms with Meggitt North Hollywood Inc also operating in the energy sector.
Within the civil aerospace sector MABS is a world leader in the supply of braking systems for regional aircraft and business jets, whilst the Meggitt North Hollywood business, which designs and manufactures fluid control devices and systems, has a higher content on large jets.
Both businesses have significant OEM and aftermarket revenues derived from sole source positions with the aftermarket, where platform lives can be up to thirty years for civil aircraft and longer for military, representing the greater proportion of revenues.
Meggitt Rockmart Inc and Meggitt Training Systems Inc both operate in the military sectors.
The principal customer of Meggitt Rockmart Inc is the US DoD to whom Meggitt Rockmart Inc are a leading supplier of flexible fuel tanks.
Meggitt Training Systems Inc supplies integrated live and virtual training packages for armed forces and law enforcement agencies across the world.
In civil aerospace growth in capacity terms, measured in available seat kilometres ASKs, is forecast to grow by at least the long-term trend of 5% in 2011 and beyond which, together with the Groups growing fleet, should drive an increase in the Groups aftermarket revenues of 8-9% per annum.
The continued anticipated recovery in air passenger travel has been reflected in a significant increase in orders received by Boeing and Airbus with large jet new aircraft deliveries forecast to increase at a compound annual growth rate of around 6% per annum over the next five years.
Deliveries of regional aircraft, which fell in 2010, are expected to recover gradually with utilisation expected to remain strong.
In the business jet market, deliveries of new aircraft are predicted to be broadly flat in 2011 although utilisation is expected to continue to recover.
Thereafter deliveries of new business jets are expected to recover strongly as a number of new platforms enter the market.
In military markets, defence budgets around the world are under pressure, as Governments rebalance spending to reduce national debt.
However, with key positions on what are expected to be growth platforms of the future, the Group anticipates organic growth from military markets of around 2% per annum over the medium-term.
The Groups energy businesses revenues are forecast to grow at double-digit percentages in the mediumterm.

Goodwill continued G rowth rates used for periods beyond those covered by managements detailed budgets and plans.
Growth rates are derived based on managements estimates which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU operates, external industry forecasts of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the extent to which a CGU has sole source position on platforms where it is able to share in a continuing stream of highly profitable aftermarket revenues, the maturity of the platforms supplied by the CGU and the technological content of the CGUs products.
For the purpose of impairment testing, a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates UK: 2.4% 2009: 2.2%, US: 2.5% 2009: 2.6%, the latter has been used: D iscount rates applied to future cash flows.
The Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC was used as the foundation for determining the discount rates to be applied.
The WACC was then adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU that are not already reflected in the future cash flows for that CGU.
The discount rates used were as follows: MABS 10.5% 2009: 11.5%, Meggitt North Hollywood Inc, 10.9% 2009: 11.9%, Meggitt Rockmart Inc 10.9% 2009: 12.0%, and Meggitt Training Systems Inc 10.0% 2009: 11.7%.
The Group has carried out a sensitivity analysis to determine the extent to which its assumptions would need to change for the calculated recoverable amounts from value in use, to equal the carrying value of goodwill of the CGU.
Management has concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

Financial instruments For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, obligations under finance leases and the current portion of bank and other borrowings, the fair value of the financial instruments approximate to their carrying values due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market values or, where not available, on discounting future cash flows at prevailing market rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires the disclosure of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Derivative financial instruments measured at fair value in the following table are classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been determined using significant inputs which are based on observable market data.
The fair value of the non-current portion of bank and other borrowings has been determined using significant inputs which are a mixture of those based on observable market data, being interest rate risk and those which are not based on observable market data, being credit risk, for which the Group takes advice from a third party.
The non-current portion of bank and other borrowings in the following table is therefore classified as level 3 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.

The swap contracts are all denominated in USD.
Of the swap contracts, 191.6 million has the economic effect of converting floating rate US dollar borrowings into fixed rate US dollar borrowings and 255.5 million has the economic effect of converting fixed rate US dollar borrowings into floating rate US dollar borrowings.
To the extent they meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the floating rate to fixed rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fixed to floating rate contracts as fair value hedges.
The total notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2009 was 495.4 million all of which were denominated in USD and had the economic effect of converting floating rate US dollar borrowings into fixed rate US dollar borrowings.
Foreign currency forward contracts Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are not merited.

Meggitts operations and facilities are subject to laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and hazardous substances into the ground, air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials and other environmental matters.
Failure to comply with its obligations potentially exposes the Group to serious consequences, including fines, other sanctions and limitations on operations.
The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of current and former sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under US law.
Provision has been made for the expected costs arising from these sites based on information currently available.
A receivable has been established to the extent these costs are recoverable under the Groups environmental insurance policies.
During the year an increase of 66.3 million in amounts recoverable from insurers was recognised 2009: 19.6 million.
A number of asbestos-related claims have been made against subsidiary companies of the Group.
To date, the amount connected with such claims in any year has not been material and many claims are covered fully or partly by existing insurance and indemnities.
There is a provision for claims which cannot be recovered from insurers.
The US Government is investigating alleged violations of US export control laws by four US subsidiaries and one UK subsidiary of the Group.
These investigations are likely to lead to financial penalties and the imposition of corrective measures for which provision has been made.
The provisions are expected to be mainly utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a discount rate relevant to each provision.
b Onerous contracts include lease obligations and trading contracts.
Provision has been set up for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of properties with onerous lease obligations and will be utilised over the lease terms typically up to five years and are discounted using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.
Provision has also been set up for the estimated losses to be made under certain trading contracts.
These are expected to be utilised over the next five years.
c Provision has been made for product warranty claims.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next three years.

The majority relate to the Groups operations in the USA and unutilised losses.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available.
No provision has been made for taxation that would arise in the event of foreign subsidiaries distributing their reserves as these amounts are retained for investment in the businesses.
The aggregate unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of such unremitted earnings is Nil million 2009: Nil million.

Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes The Group operates one UK defined benefit scheme which is funded and closed to new members.
In the USA, the Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, all of which are closed to new members.
The US schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
In Switzerland the Group operates a defined benefit scheme which is a funded scheme.
The assets of all of the defined benefit schemes are held in trust funds separate from the Groups finances.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
Healthcare schemes The Group has two principal other post-retirement benefit schemes providing medical and life assurance benefits, both of which arose on the acquisition of K & F. These schemes are unfunded.

Prior to this the Group had been exposed to the risk of future healthcare trend rates.
The reduction in scheme liabilities arising from the agreement has been recorded as a past service credit.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Retirement benefit obligations continued In determining pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the scheme populations.
The Groups mortality assumptions in the UK are based on recent mortality investigations of Self Administered Pension Schemes adjusted to reflect the profile of the membership of the Plan.
Allowance has also been made for rates of mortality to continue to fall in the medium-term and that in the long-term, rates of mortality will continue to fall at the rate of 1% per annum.
In the US mortality assumptions are based on the RP2000 IRS RPA tables.

Share-based payment The Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees.
The total expense recorded in the income statement for the year in respect of such schemes was 14.3 million 2009: 5.4 million.
The nature of each scheme which has a significant impact on the expense recorded in the income statement is set out below.
1996 No 1 & No 2 Executive Share Option Schemes and Executive Share Option Scheme 2005 Equity-settled Share options are granted to certain senior executives at an option price equal to the market price of the shares on the date the grant is made.
The options are generally exercisable at the earliest three years after the grant is made.
Options can only be exercised if the Group meets an earnings per share performance condition.
The Group has no obligation, legal or constructive, to settle the options in cash.
Awards under Part A of the schemes provide for the executive on exercise to be entitled, on payment of the option price, to the number of shares under option.
Awards under Part B of the schemes are in the form of equity-settled share appreciation rights SARs and provide for the executive on exercise to be entitled to receive equity equivalent to the gain in value between the option price and the market price on the date of exercise.
An expense of 3.2 million 2009: 1.0 million was recorded in the year.

The fair value of the awards made in the year were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The significant assumptions used in the model and the fair values determined were: 2010 2009 Award in Award in March April Share price at date of grant pence 286.10 169.50 Option price pence 286.10 169.50 Vesting period years 3 3 Expected volatility 36% 35% Expected life of option years 5 5 Risk free rate 2.75% 2.60% Expected dividend yield 3.20% 3.10% Fair value at date of award pence 74.74 42.30 Expected volatility figures are based on historical volatility over the last five years measured using a statistical analysis of daily share prices.
The awards may be exercised at any point up to ten years after the date the award was made.
Cash-settled Under the terms of the Meggitt Executive Share Option Scheme 2005, the Group may grant cash-settled SARs to certain overseas employees.
The Group is required to pay the intrinsic value of the SAR to the employee at the date of exercise.
A charge of 6.4 million 2009: 2.4 million was recorded in the year.
The Group has recorded a liability at the balance sheet date of 8.4 million 2009: 2.6 million.
The total intrinsic value at the balance sheet date was 10.1 million 2009: 0.4 million.

The fair value of each cashsettled SAR was determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model and reflects the same assumptions used for equity-settled awards as disclosed above.
As a cash-settled award, the fair value of outstanding SARs is reassessed at each balance sheet date.

Share-based payment continued Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 Under the Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005, an annual award of shares may be made to certain senior executives.
For awards made in 2007 and earlier years the number of shares, if any that an executive ultimately received, depended on the Groups performance during a three year period commencing at the beginning of the financial year in which the award was made.
Performance was measured by comparing the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by the Group with that of other companies in a comparator group chosen by the Remuneration Committee.
Changes to the performance condition were made for the 2008 and subsequent awards.
In line with what is now common market practice, the vesting of 50% of the awards is based on TSR performance and 50% on an earnings per share condition EPS.
The three year performance period for awards made in 2009 and subsequent awards, which are subject to the TSR performance condition, was also amended to commence on the date of award.
An expense of 4.3 million 2009: 1.7 million was recorded in the year.
Movements in the number of outstanding shares that may potentially be released to employees are as follows: 2010 2009 No.

As at 31 December 2010, none of the shares under award are eligible for release 2009: Nil.
The fair value of the award made in 2009 and which is subject to the EPS condition was 193.90 pence.
The fair value of the award made in 2009 which is subject to the TSR performance condition was 117.90 pence and was measured using a Monte Carlo model.
The significant assumptions used in the model and the fair values determined were: 2009 Award in September Share price at date of award pence 193.90 Vesting period years 3 Expected volatility 45% Expected life of award years 3 Risk free rate 2.50% Expected dividend yield 3.70% Fair value at date of award pence 117.90 Expected volatility figures are based on historic volatility over the last three years measured using a statistical analysis of weekly share prices.
Own shares Own shares represents shares in the Company that are held by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the trust which was formed to purchase shares to be used to meet certain of the Companys future obligations in respect of employee share schemes as described in the Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 52.
At 31 December 2010 the trust held 727,247 ordinary shares 2009: Nil of which 718,027 were allocated to the Deferred Share Bonus Plan and 9,220 were unallocated, being retained by the trust for future use.
The shares were purchased during the year and have a cost of 2.1 million at 31 December 2010.
The market value of the shares at 31 December 2010 was 2.7 million representing 0.1% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The Group retains the full benefit of the unallocated shares.
The Group also retains the full benefit of 135,909 of the shares in the Deferred Share Bonus Plan until such time as awards are released to participating employees.
The Group has no benefit accruing to it over the remaining 582,118 shares in the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
Contingent liabilities The Company has given guarantees in respect of uncommitted credit facilities for certain of its subsidiaries, some property leases, other leasing arrangements and the performance by some current and former subsidiaries of certain contracts.
Also, there are similar guarantees given by certain other Group companies.
The fair value of these guarantees is not considered to be significant.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.

Contractual commitments Capital commitments 2010 2009 m m Contracted for but not incurred: Intangible assets 0.5 1.2 Property, plant & equipment 4.3 3.4 Total 4.8 4.6 Operating lease commitments The Group leases various factories, warehouses and offices under non-cancellable operating leases.
These leases have various lease periods, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Additionally the Group also leases various items of plant and machinery under cancellable operating leases.
The expenditure on operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred and is disclosed in note 7.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Not later than one year 11.0 11.6 Later than one year and not later than five years 27.1 29.7 Later than five years 16.4 17.5 Total 54.5 58.8 Other financial commitments The Group enters into long-term arrangements with Aircraft and or Original Equipment Manufacturers to design, develop and supply products to them for the life of the aircraft.
This represents a significant long-term financial commitment for the Group and requires the consideration of a number of uncertainties including the feasibility of the product and the ultimate commercial viability over a period which can extend over 40 years.
The directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant contingent liabilities arising from these commitments.
