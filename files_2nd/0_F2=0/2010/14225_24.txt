Review of the year Corporate governance Accounts SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 85 6 iNCOME TaX CONTiNUED The following factors that will affect the Group's future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits between the UK and overseas: in particular, France Germany Belgium corporate tax rates greater than 28% and Ireland Poland Netherlands Czech Republic Slovakia corporate tax rates less than 28%.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see Note 22.
In addition to the amounts credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been credited charged directly to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity: 2010 2009 m m Deferred tax movement associated with actuarial loss 0.5 1.3 Current and deferred tax on share options 0.2 Tax charge on exchange difference arising on borrowings and derivative financial instruments 0.9 5.5 Change in rate 0.2 0.4 4.2 ChaNGE iN ThE TaX RaTE On 28 June 2010, the Finance Bill 201011 was presented to the UK Parliament.
The Bill proposed four annual reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% by 201415.
At the balance sheet date, the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 27% from April 2011 had been enacted.
The resulting net reduction in the deferred tax asset has been reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2010 and gave rise to a credit to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 0.2m.
It is currently expected that each future Finance Bill enacted will reduce the UK corporation tax rate by 1% until the rate of 24% is reached.

Awards have also been made in 2010 through a shadow Cash LTIP scheme that requires the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the share appreciation rights to the employee at the date of exercise.
This scheme has exactly the same conditions and vesting criteria as the 2010 LTIP, the difference being that the award is settled in the cash value of the equity in the event of the options being exercised, rather than through the issue of shares.
This scheme has been accounted for in the same way as the equity-settled scheme, with the exception that the liability is recognised within accruals as opposed to equity.

e ShARe InCentIve plAn SIp Shares were granted under the SIP scheme for the first time in 2005.
The SIP is an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company will match one free share up to a maximum of four free shares per month.
No performance criteria is attached to these matching shares other than to avoid forfeiture they must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2010, 48,622 2009: 64,122 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

11 iNTEREsT iN assOCiaTE On 4 May 2010, the Company made a strategic trade investment in Ice Energy Technologies Limited Ice, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, by acquiring shares in that company from existing management.
Ice is a specialist designer and installer of heat pumps and Solar PV systems.
Consideration of 1.0m was paid to the shareholders of Ice and a further 0.5m was paid for new shares in the company, taking the total cost of the investment to 1.6m including costs of 0.1m.
Following the investment, the Group holds a 25% stake in the company and as such this investment will be accounted for as an associate in accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates.
In addition to this, at the date of signing this report, the Company has made a loan to Ice amounting to 1.2m which is included within trade receivables.
The loan is due for repayment in 2013.
The Groups share of operating income arising from this investment since 4 May 2010 has been positive but minimal.
Given that the Groups Consolidated Income Statement is reported in ms, in order for a figure to be separately disclosable the minimum threshold for recognition is 50,000, i. e. 0.1m.
As a result, no separate recognition of the Groups share of income attributable to this associate has been made on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement.
Accordingly no further analysis has been given in respect of Ices results or balance sheet position on the grounds of materiality.
The current accounting period for Ice ends on 31 March 2011.
The company does not have the same accounting reference date as SIG plc as the company operates independently of SIG, and therefore may independently select the accounting reference date it considers most appropriate.

iMPaiRMENT REviEW PROCEss The Group tests Goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may exist.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
For the majority of CGUs, the Group performs Goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following years budget and a projection of cash flows based upon industry growth expectations 0%3% over a period of five years.
Where detailed five year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes.
After this period, the growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry or economy.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre tax rates and range between 11% and 13%.
2010 iMPaiRMENT REviEW REsULTs The most recent impairment reviews indicated potential impairments in a number of CGUs, as follows: Intangible Goodwill assets Total CGU m m m Interiors Manufacturing 24.6 17.9 42.5 Central Europe 12.0 12.0 UK SCP Access Hire 7.5 5.1 12.6 Ireland 7.1 5.5 12.6 UK Distribution Cornish Fixings 0.6 0.1 0.7 51.8 28.6 80.4 The Interiors Manufacturing division has continued to experience significantly reduced levels of demand, and as such it is anticipated that the full benefits of the restructuring projects ongoing in that division will not be seen for some time.
As a result of this, the value in use calculation has indicated an impairment in the Interiors Manufacturing CGU of 42.5m, which has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement during the year.
This impairment charge has been allocated to Goodwill 24.6m and to Intangible assets per Note 13 17.9m.
This impairment charge reduces the carrying value of the Goodwill and intangible assets attributable to this CGU to nil.
The Groups Central Europe division has continued to perform poorly in an extremely challenging economic environment in particular in Hungary.
The Group remains committed to the development of its Central European business, however, the economic recovery in these markets in particular Hungary is expected to take longer than originally anticipated.
As a result, the Directors have reviewed the future cash flows and concluded that the carrying value of Goodwill is no longer fully supportable, with the Groups value in use calculation indicating an impairment of 12.0m, which has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The remaining Goodwill and Intangibles assets in respect of this CGU amounted to 13.0m 7.3m Goodwill and 5.7m Intangible assets, which is supported by the value in use calculation.
92 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 noteS to the ACCountS ContInued 12 GOODWiLL CONTiNUED 2010 iMPaiRMENT REviEW REsULTs CONTiNUED The Access Hire business a specific business within the UK SCP CGU has also suffered from the recent UK economic downturn, such that a recovery to previous trading levels is considered unlikely in the near future.
Further to this, the business Shoring and Piling division was closed during 2010.
As a result of this, the value in use calculation indicates that an impairment of 12.6m is necessary, split between Goodwill 7.5m and Intangible assets per Note 13 5.1m.
This impairment charge reduces the carrying value of the Goodwill and Intangible assets attributable to this CGU to nil.
Given the continuing challenging trading conditions experienced in Ireland, and the resulting restructuring programme that has significantly reduced the size of the Groups operations in this region, the Directors have reviewed the future cash flows and concluded that the carrying value of the Ireland CGU is nil, which results in an impairment charge of 12.6m, being 7.1m Goodwill and 5.5m Intangible assets see Note 13.
Finally, in addition to the impairments noted above, following the disposal of Cornish Fixings in February 2011 part of the UK Distribution CGU, the Directors have noted the Goodwill in respect of this business has been impaired in full, leading to a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement of 0.7m, allocated to Goodwill 0.6m and Intangible assets 0.1m.
sENsiTiviTY aNaLYsis The Group currently has 14 CGUs.
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions.
Revenue is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the Goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 5% reduction in revenue has been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
In the majority of cases, no impairment would arise from a 5% reduction in revenue in the forecast assumptions.
If a 5% reduction in revenue were to arise from that forecast in the Goodwill impairment reviews, an impairment of 5.6m would arise in one CGU, Central Europe, being 1% of the total carrying value of Goodwill and Intangible assets held on the Groups Consolidated Balance Sheet.
An impairment charge based upon management forecasts has already been recognised in 2010 in respect of the Central Europe CGU, and therefore the reduction in revenue required to provide a breakeven position and the amount by which the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value is zero.
The average per annum increase in revenue in the management forecast in this CGU from that arising in 2010 is 8% in the first five years forecast.
sUMMaRY aNaLYsis Following these impairments, the recoverable amounts of Goodwill in respect of all CGUs were fully supported by the value in use calculations in the year and are as follows: 2010 2009 m m UK Distribution 83.4 84.5 UK Roofing and External Elements 80.8 80.8 UK Specialist Construction Products 22.6 30.1 UK Interiors Manufacturing 24.6 Ireland 7.1 Poland 10.2 10.2 Larivire 170.4 177.1 German Roofing 19.6 20.4 Central Europe 7.3 20.1 Air Trade Centre 13.8 14.4 Total 408.1 469.3 Other CGUs 39.0 37.6 Total Goodwill 447.1 506.9 Review of the year Corporate governance Accounts SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 93 13 iNTaNGiBLE assETs The intangible assets presented below relate entirely to acquired Intangibles.
These arise as a result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of acquired Intangibles from Goodwill.
As detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions that took place before 1 January 2004.
During 2009 and 2010, the Group owned other purchased intangible assets with an insignificant book value mainly software separable from any associated hardware and these have not been reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the grounds of materiality.

The weighted average amortisation period for each category of intangible asset is disclosed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on page 75.
As a result of the annual impairment reviews referred to in Note 12, the Directors have decided that the carrying value of the intangible assets in relation to the Groups Interiors Manufacturing division is no longer supportable.
This has led to an impairment charge of 17.9m, of which 12.6m relates to the Leaderflush Shapland brand.
The remaining 5.3m relates to customer relationship assets.
Further impairments have been booked in respect of Ireland 5.5m and UK SCP - Access Hire 5.1m, both customer relationship assets.

Included within the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 103.8m 2009: 88.5m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 55.1m 2009: 57.0m and a provision for impairment of 34.5m 2009: 35.0m.
The provision for impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
CREDiT RisK MaNaGEMENT Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

hEDGiNG RELaTiONshiPs Included within financial assets are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 52.0m 2009: 38.6m and loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents of 503.4m 2009: 605.2m.
Included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 12.6m 2009: 15.7m and liabilities including trade payables at amortised cost of 574.8m 2009: 708.2m.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and IAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Income Statement in the column entitled Other items.
In order to manage the Group's exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the financial instruments entered into by the Group are categorised as Level 2.

This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
a iNTEREsT RaTE sENsiTiviTY The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates.

The sensitivity analysis of the Group's exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

Given current and forecast trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
The Group has not taken account of excess non-trading losses associated with financial instruments in determining the above deferred tax asset at 31 December 2010.
During the year, the Group has utilised 10m gross of previously unrecognised deferred tax on non-trading losses.
In this respect, any future utilisation of the unrecognised deferred tax asset associated with the non-trading losses of 108m 2009: 118m will result in a reduction of cash payments of tax and will also result in a profit and loss benefit in the year of utilisation.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 8m 2009: 4m that have not been recognised on the basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The tax losses in the Czech Republic of 2m and Poland of 1m expire after five years.
The remaining tax losses of 5m may be carried forward indefinitely.
The total gross value of unrecognised tax losses at 31 December 2010 therefore amounted to 116m 2009: 122m.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries with a lower rate of corporation tax than that suffered in the UK, for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised, was 30m 2009: 31m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Of these schemes, one 2009: one has assets held in a separate trustee administered fund and four 2009: four are overseas book reserved schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes all of which are independently managed.
The pension charge for the year amounted to 7.2m 2009: 7.2m, of which 2.4m 2009: 2.9m related to defined benefit pension schemes and 4.8m 2009: 4.3m related to defined contribution schemes.
defIned benefIt penSIon SCheme vAluAtIonS In accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 which was issued on 16 December 2004, the Group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2007 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 75.0m and their actuarial value covered 83% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other four schemes are book reserved schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
ConSolIdAted InCome StAtement ChARGeS The pension charge for the year relating to the defined benefit pension schemes was 2.4m 2009: 2.9m.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2010 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members, has an age profile that is rising and therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The four overseas book reserved schemes remain open to new members.
ConSolIdAted bAlAnCe Sheet lIAbIlIty The balance sheet position in respect of the five defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2010 2009 m m Pension liability before taxation 25.2 24.0 Related deferred tax asset 5.4 5.3 Pension liability after taxation 19.8 18.7 The actuarial loss of 1.8m 2009: 4.7m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax credit of 0.5m 2009: 1.3m and deferred tax charge of 0.2m in respect of the change in the UK standard rate of tax from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The remaining deferred tax charge of 0.2m 2009: credit of 0.1m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses gross of deferred tax from 2004 onwards recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income amounted to a loss of 18.2m 2009: 16.4m.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 20.2m 2009: 19.0m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 5.0m 2009: 5.0m relates to unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2010 2009 m m Pension liability at beginning of year 24.0 19.1 Current service cost 1.9 1.6 Contributions 2.8 2.4 Net finance cost 0.5 1.3 Actuarial loss 1.8 4.7 Exchange difference 0.2 0.3 Pension liability at end of year 25.2 24.0 Contributions of approximately 2.7m are expected to be paid to the plan during the annual period beginning 1 January 2011.
The principal assumptions used for the IAS 19 actuarial valuation of the schemes were: 2010 2009 2008 % % % Rate of increase in salaries 3.9 4.5 4.7 Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 3.9 4.5 4.7 Rate of increase LPI pensions in payment 3.4 3.5 2.7 Discount rate 5.4 5.7 6.2 Inflation assumption 3.4 3.5 2.7 108 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 noteS to the ACCountS ContInued 28 GUaRaNTEEs aND OThER FiNaNCiaL COMMiTMENTs CONTiNUED C PENsiON sChEMEs CONTiNUED ConSolIdAted bAlAnCe Sheet lIAbIlIty ContInued Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for LPI revaluation in deferment.
The life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 60 is 28.5 years 2009: 28.5 years.
If the discount rate was to be increased decreased by 0.25%, this would decrease increase the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 5.3m.
The fair value of the assets in the schemes, the present value of the liabilities in the schemes and the expected rate of return at each balance sheet date were: 2010 2010 2009 2009 2008 2008 2007 2007 2006 2006 % m % m % m % m % m Equities 7.2 55.0 7.5 50.7 6.4 40.3 6.7 48.7 6.7 44.0 Bonds 5.0 37.0 5.3 36.7 5.2 34.3 4.7 28.0 4.6 23.7 Other 5.2 6.2 N A N A 6.2 0.1 5.5 0.2 Total fair value of assets 98.2 87.4 74.6 76.8 67.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 123.4 111.4 93.7 92.5 91.5 Deficit in the scheme 25.2 24.0 19.1 15.7 23.6 Related deferred tax asset 5.4 5.3 3.9 3.4 6.7 Pension liability after taxation 19.8 18.7 15.2 12.3 16.9 The UK Government has announced that statutory pension increases and revaluation would be based on the Consumer Prices Index CPI measure of price inflation rather than the Retail Prices Index RPI measure.
The effect of this change on the Groups UK defined benefit pension scheme in the current year has been an additional gain through equity of 2.0m.
