The Company also participates in the UK Main Pension Scheme, which is the principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees.
The UK Main Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme.
However, the Company is unable to separately identify on a consistent and reasonable basis its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Groups defined benefit scheme to which it participates, mainly because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate information for disposed companies and the subjective nature of any allocation basis.
Therefore the Company accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme, in accordance with the provisions of FRS 17.
The scheme is currently in deficit on an IAS 19 basis using the projected credit actuarial valuation method to determine the schemes liabilities.
Details of the scheme and its deficit are included in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 19, which are generally equivalent to those of FRS 17.

The Special Award is subject to a three-year performance period.
50% of vested shares will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being released after a 12 month holding period.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflect those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being more demanding.
The Special Award is split into two layers, each of which vests on a different basis.
For the first layer equal to 200% of base salary, 20% will vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance.
For the second layer equal to 500% of base salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% will vest for maximum performance.
Vesting in each layer will be on a straight-line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP.
However, for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile.
This has been calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 i. e. 40%.
