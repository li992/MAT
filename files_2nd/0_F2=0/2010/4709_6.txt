The amendment to IAS 38 clarifi es the accounting for advertising expenditure.
The group charges advertising expenditure to the income statement when it has a right of access to the goods or services acquired, as opposed to charging such costs to the income statement when the advertisement is fi first shown to the public.
Advertisements, non-depreciable point of sale materials, costs in respect of events and some sponsorship payments previously recorded in the income statement when delivered to the fi final customer are now expensed when delivered to the company.
In addition, the group has changed its accounting policy in respect of returnable bottles and crates as the change more appropriately refl ects the usage of these assets.
These are now held within property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis to estimated residual values over their expected useful lives.
Formerly a number of returnable bottles and crates were held within inventories and written down on purchase to their net realisable value.
The impacts of the adoption of these changes in accounting policies have reduced operating profi t for the year ended 30 June 2009 by 25 million 2008 14 million: 2007 increase of 1 million: 2006 13 million, reduced profi t from continuing operations for the year ended 30 June 2009 by 19 million 2008 11 million: 2007 nil: 2006 9 million and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended 30 June 2009 by 0.6 pence 2008 0.3 pence: 2007 nil: 2006 0.3 pence.
The charge of 3 million for year ended 30 June 2009 is in respect of non-controlling interests 2008 3 million: 2007 nil: 2006 1 million.
On the consolidated balance sheet at 30 June 2009 total assets decreased by 78 million 2008 35 million: 2007 22 million: 2006 18 million and total equity reduced by 62 million 2008 42 million: 2007 29 million: 2006 29 million of which non-controlling interests reduced by 10 million 2008 7 million: 2007 4 million: 2006 4 million.
