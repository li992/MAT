Auditors remuneration continued The audit committee has established pre-approval policies and procedures for the engagement of Ernst & Young to render audit and certain assurance and tax services.
The audit fees payable to Ernst & Young are reviewed by the audit committee in the context of other global companies for cost-effectiveness.

These services are for a fixed term.
