Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements comply with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Fixed asset investments The Companys investments in group undertakings are held at cost less provision for impairment, except for those amounts designated as being in a fair value hedge see below.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, subject to certain exceptions, in respect of all material timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and for tax purposes.
Those timing differences recognised include accelerated capital allowances and short-term timing differences.
Timing differences not recognised include those relating to the revaluation of xed assets in the absence of a commitment to sell the assets, the gain on sale of assets rolled into replacement assets and the distribution of pro ts from overseas companies in the absence of any commitment by the Company to make the distribution.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Employee bene ts i Pension obligations The Company has both fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution pension arrangements.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Companys fide ned bene t arrangements is the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets, shown net of deferred tax.
The cost of providing bene ts is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by quali ed actuaries.
The current service cost of providing pension bene ts to employees, together with the cost of any bene ts relating to past service, is charged to operating pro t and included in staff costs.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of finance cost or income adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Companys fide ned bene t plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the Companys fide ned contribution arrangements, the charge against pro t is equal to the amount of contributions payable.
ii Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is generally recognised over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect, on the number of shares that will eventually vest, of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures due to employees leaving the employment of the Company.
Fair values are calculated using a combination of Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply FRS 20 only to those equitysettled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in treasury treasury shares or by the Companys employee share trusts for the purpose of ful lling obligations in respect of the Groups employee share plans are deducted from shareholders funds in the Company balance sheet.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost taken to the pro t and loss account reserve except where the proceeds exceed the consideration paid, where the excess is transferred to the share premium account.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.

Foreign exchange differences arising on translation on both of these items using the period end rate are taken to the pro t and loss account.
The remainder of the investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH is held at cost as described above.

The consolidated financial statements of Mitchells & Butlers plc are required to comply with the Companies Disclosure of Auditor and Liability Limitation Agreements Remuneration Regulations 2008.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
