The carrying value of the companys financial instruments is exposed to movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates primarily US dollars.
The company estimates that a 1% increase in interest rates would result in a 47m decrease in the carrying value of its financial instruments, with a 1% decrease in interest rates resulting in a 51m increase in their carrying value.
The company also estimates that a 10% strengthening in sterling would decrease the carrying value of its financial instruments by 115m, while a 10% decrease in the value of sterling would increase the carrying value by 141m.
These increases and decreases in carrying value would be recorded through the income statement.
Sensitivities are calculated using estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
Where modelling an interest rate decrease of 1% led to negative interest rates, these points on the yield curve were adjusted to 0%.
