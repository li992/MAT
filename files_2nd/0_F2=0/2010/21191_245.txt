Following each actuarial valuation, the Company and the trustees agree the level of contributions needed and funding levels are then monitored on an annual basis.
At 31 March 2009, the date of the last actuarial valuation, this section of the scheme had an excess of obligations over available assets, on a funding basis, which uses more prudent assumptions than are required for reporting under IAS 19, of 3.0 billion.
As a result of that valuation, the Company and the trustees have agreed a long-term funding plan where contributions, together with anticipated growth in scheme investments, are expected to eliminate the funding deficit over time.
Under this agreement, deficit funding payments of 378 million were made in 2010, and are expected to be 136 million in 2011.
Partly as a result of the higher funding payments and the impact on scheme liabilities of the scheme closures described above, the funding deficit is estimated to have fallen to 1.3 billion at 31 December 2010.
The employing companies contributions to the defined benefit section of the ASPS throughout 2010 were 48% of employees pensionable salaries, together with the cost of redundancies during the year and the additional deficit funding described above, together totalling 501 million.
Until 31 March 2011, the employers contribution rate for 2011 has been maintained as 48% of pensionable salaries, with expected service funding contributions for that period falling to 25 million.
Active members of this section of the ASPS contributed between 5% and 7.5% of their pensionable salaries during 2010.
In 2006, the Groups UK life business carried out an investigation into the allocation of costs in respect of funding the ASPS, to identify the deficit that arose in respect of accruals prior to the introduction of the current management services agreements MSAs and to propose a split between individual product companies based on an allocation of the deficit into preand post-MSA amounts.
The results of this review were agreed by the relevant company boards and accepted by the UK regulator.
Consequently, with effect from 1 January 2006, the Companys UK with-profit product companies have been liable for a share of the additional payments for deficit funding referred to above up to a total of 130 million.
This has resulted in movements between the unallocated divisible surplus UDS and retained earnings via the statement of comprehensive income of 18 million in 2010 2009: 24 million to reflect changes in the amount recoverable from the with-profit product companies.
ii Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
Members of this section contribute at least 1% of their pensionable salaries and, depending on the percentage chosen, the Company contributes up to a maximum 14%, together with the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2011. d Credit charges to the income statement The total pension credit costs of all the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2010 2009 m m 227 UK defined benefit schemes 84 Overseas defined benefit schemes 52 103 Total defined benefit schemes note 10b 175 187 UK defined contribution schemes 53 53 Overseas defined contribution schemes 17 20 Total defined contribution schemes note 10b 70 73 Total credit charge for pension schemes 105 260 The credit for the defined benefit schemes arises from the 286 million gain on the closure of the UK scheme to future accrual, described in section c above.
There were no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at either 31 December 2009 or 2010. e IAS 19 disclosures Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland are given below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.
Total employer contributions for these schemes in 2011, including the ASPS deficit funding, are expected to be 285 million.
i Assumptions on scheme liabilities The projected unit credit method The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
270 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48 Pension obligations continued Alternative measurement methods There are alternative methods of measuring liabilities, for example by calculating an accumulated benefit obligation the present value of benefits for service already rendered but with no allowance for future salary increases or on a solvency basis, using the cost of securing the benefits at a particular date with an insurance company or one of the growing market of alternative buy-out providers.
This could take the form of a buy-out, in which the entire liability will be settled in one payment with all obligations transferred to an insurance company or buy-out provider, or a buy-in, in which annuities or other insurance products are purchased to cover a part or all of the liability.
A valuation of the liabilities in either of these cases will almost always result in a higher estimate of the pension deficit than under an ongoing approach, as they assume that the sponsor immediately transfers the majority, if not all, of the risk to another provider who would be seeking to make a profit on the transaction.
However, there are only a limited number of organisations that would be able to offer these options for schemes of the size of those in our Group.
The full buy-out cost would only be known if quotes were obtained from such organisations but, to illustrate the cost of a buy-out valuation, an estimate for the main UK scheme is that the year-end liabilities of 7.9 billion could be valued some 4.1 billion higher, at 12.0 billion.
There is a small buy-out market in Ireland, largely restricted to pensions currently in payment and it is not clear whether current capacity would enable an immediate buy-out of our Irish pension liabilities at present.
The Canadian defined benefit plans liabilities represent the likely limit on what the Canadian group annuity market could absorb at normal competitive group annuity prices if the entire plan were subject to a buy-out valuation.
There is in fact a reasonably high chance that only a portion of the plans liabilities could be absorbed in one tranche.
IAS 19 requires us to use the projected unit credit method to measure our pension scheme liabilities.
Neither of the alternative methods is considered appropriate in presenting fairly the Groups obligations to the members of its pension schemes on an ongoing basis, so they are not considered further.
Valuations and assumptions The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of that standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2010.
Scheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2010.
The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: UK Netherlands 2010 2009 2010 2009 Inflation rate 3.5% 3.6% 1.9% 2.1% General salary increases 5.3% 5.4% 2.9% 3.1% Pension increases 3.5% 3.6% 1.9 2.1% 1.9% Deferred pension increases 3.5% 3.6% 1.9% 2.1% 1.9% Discount rate 5.5% 5.7% 5.1% 5.2% Basis of discount rate AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds Age-related scale increases plus 2.9% 2009: 3.1%.
2.1% until 2011 and expected return less 3% thereafter 2009: 2.1% until 2011 and 1.9% thereafter.
Canada Ireland 2010 2009 2010 2009 Inflation rate 2.5% 2.5% 2.0% 2.0% General salary increases 3.75% 3.75% 3.5% 3.5% Pension increases 1.25% 1.25% 2.0% 2.0% Deferred pension increases 2.0% 2.0% Discount rate 5.0% 5.5% 5.6% 5.5% Basis of discount rate AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high-quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
A 1% increase in this rate and therefore the net discount rate would reduce the liabilities by 1.6 billion and the service cost for the year by 36 million.
It would also reduce the interest cost on those liabilities by 2 million.
Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.
Financial statements IFRS 271 Performance review Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 48 Pension obligations continued The mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2010 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy pension Life expectancy pension duration at NRA of a male duration at NRA of a female Normal 20 years 20 years retirement Currently younger Currently younger Mortality table age NRA aged NRA than NRA aged NRA than NRA UK ASPS Club Vita pooled experience, including an allowance for future improvements 60 89.6 92.8 89.7 91.9 29.6 32.8 29.7 31.9 RAC SAPS series 1, including allowances for future improvement 65 87.6 90.6 89.7 91.7 22.6 25.6 24.7 26.7 Netherlands CBS 2010, adjusted for experience and allowance for future improvements 65 85.5 86.9 87.5 88.7 20.5 21.9 22.5 23.7 Canada UP1994 projected to 2020, using Projection Scale AA 65 84.4 84.8 86.8 86.8 19.4 19.8 21.8 21.8 Ireland 94% PNA00 with allowance for future improvements 61 86.5 89.5 89.3 92.3 25.5 28.5 28.3 31.3 The assumptions above are based on commonly used mortality tables and, in the UK, have been changed to those used by both schemes trustees in the most recent full actuarial valuations.
The new tables make allowance for observed variations in such factors as age, gender, pension amount, salary and postcode-based lifestyle group, and have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
In the UK schemes, which are by far the most material to the Group, the assumptions include an allowance for future mortality improvement, based on the actuarial professions long and medium cohort projection tables for the ASPS and RAC schemes respectively and incorporating underpins to the rate of future improvement equal to 1.5% pa for males and 1.0% pa for females.
The effect of assuming all members were one year younger would increase the above schemes liabilities by 240 million and the service cost for the year by 3 million.
The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 18 years in the UK schemes and between 12 and 19 years in the overseas schemes.
The undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme are expected to be as shown in the chart below: Undiscounted benefit payments m Current active and deferred member cash ows Pensioner cash ows 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2011 2041 2071 2101 ii Assumptions on scheme assets The expected rates of return on the schemes assets are: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 6.8% Equities 7.2% 7.8% 6.2% 7.0% 7.6% 6.9% 7.2% Bonds 4.4% 4.8% 3.6% 4.3% 3.2% 3.5% 2.7% 4.5% Property 5.7% 6.3% 2.9% 5.2% n a n a 5.4% 5.7% Cash 0.6% 0.9% n a n a n a n a 2.7% 2.9% The overall rates of return are based on the expected returns within each asset category and on current asset allocations.
The expected returns for equities and properties are aligned with the rates used for the longer-term investment return assumptions, other than in the Netherlands, where they have been developed in conjunction with external advisers due to the characteristics of the scheme.
The figures for the total expected return on scheme assets in the following section are stated after deducting investment expenses.
272 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48 Pension obligations continued iii Investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies Plan assets include investments in Group-managed funds in the consolidated statement of financial position of 116 million 2009: 101 million in the UK scheme, and insurance policies with other Group companies of 160 million and 1,445 million 2009: 157 million and 1,351 million in the UK and Dutch schemes respectively.
The Dutch insurance policies are considered nontransferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so have been treated as other obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions see note 47.
The treatment in the relevant parts of the financial statements is as follows: Plan assets The treatment of these funds and policies in the consolidated statement of financial position is described above.
Expected rates of return Where the relevant insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, their expected rates of return are included in the appropriate line in the table in section ii above.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses on the pension schemes recognised in other comprehensive income since 1 January 2004 the date of transition to IFRS is a loss of 1,231 million at 31 December 2010 2009: cumulative loss of 2,230 million.

To meet these objectives, each schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities.
These reflect the current long-term asset allocation ranges chosen, having regard to the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Main UK scheme Both the Group and the trustees regularly review the asset liability management of the main UK scheme.
It is fully understood that, whilst the current asset mix is designed to produce appropriate long-term returns, this introduces a material risk of volatility in the schemes surplus or deficit of assets compared with its liabilities.
The principal asset risks to which the scheme is exposed are: Equity market risk the effect of equity market falls on the value of plan assets.
Inflation risk the effect of inflation rising faster than expected on the value of the plan liabilities.
Interest rate risk falling interest rates leading to an increase in liabilities significantly exceeding the increase in the value of assets.
There is also an exposure to currency risk where assets are not denominated in the same currency as the liabilities.
The majority of this exposure has been removed by the use of hedging instruments.
In 2010, there has been a reduction in the proportion of assets invested in equities, thereby mitigating the equity risk above.
In addition, the trustees have taken further measures to partially mitigate inflation and interest rate risks.
Other schemes The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.
