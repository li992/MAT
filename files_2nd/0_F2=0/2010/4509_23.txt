NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Segmental analysis The Groups international operations are managed and reported internally on a divisional basis that reflects the different characteristics of each business.
These divisions have been disclosed as reportable segments because they are the components that the Board monitors regularly in making decisions about operating matters such as allocating resources to businesses and assessing performance.
Each division has its own managing director who reports directly to the Chief Executive.
The principal financial information reviewed by the Board, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker, is revenue and operating profit before exceptional items, measured on an IFRS basis.
The Groups segments are: Currency provides banknote paper, printed banknotes and banknote security features.
Cash Processing Solutions primarily focused on the production of large sorters for central banks, complementing the Currency business.
Security Products produces security documents, including authentication labels, travellers cheques and fiscal stamps.
Identity Systems involved in the production of passports, including ePassports, together with other secure identity products.

Reorganisation costs principally comprise redundancy charges and rationalisation of products and site capabilities.
During 2008, fide La Rue announced its intention to reduce central costs by approximately 50 per cent following the disposal of Cash Systems.
This programme was completed ahead of schedule.
Central reorganisation costs relating to this programme principally covered redundancy, separation costs and site rationalisation charges.
The exceptional charges in the year gave rise to a related tax credit of 1.0m.
In addition 1.4m of tax credit arose when the tax treatment of some prior year exceptional items was determined.
In 2008 2009 exceptional tax credits were 0.9m, with a credit of 1.9m in relation to the central reorganisation being partly offset by a 1.0m charge in respect of the phasing out of Industrial Buildings Allowances.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the impact of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
During 2008 2009 the Company returned cash of 460m to shareholders and at the same time carried out a consolidation of its share capital.
These transactions were conditional on each other.
They were specifically designed to achieve the same overall effect on the Companys capital structure as a buy back of shares in a way in which all shareholders could participate.
Accordingly, earnings per share is presented on the basis that in substance a share buy back occurred.
The Directors are of the opinion that the publication of the headline earnings is useful to readers of annual accounts as they give an indication of underlying business performance.

The impairment in the year arose from the proposed closure of a small CPS business and was charged to exceptional items within the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups Cash Generating Units CGUs identified according to business segment and country of operation.
A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2010 2009 m m Currency 4.3 4.3 Cash Processing Solutions 3.6 3.7 7.9 8.0 The majority of the goodwill relates to the acquisition of CSI Inc in 2001 which was allocated to Currency and Cash Processing Solutions on the basis that the acquired business generated synergies for both CGUs.
The estimates of recoverable amount are based on value-in-use calculations.
In each case, the value-in-use calculations are based on cash flow projections covering a five year period based on the 2010 2011 budget plus a terminal year.
The key assumptions underlying these projections are summarised below: a Currency: The volume and price of orders secured, particularly in respect of banknotes and banknote papers, are based on a combination of the current order book and past experience, taking into account: i expectations in respect of economic growth and central banks banknote circulation policies ii the Companys knowledge of its customer base, gained through its long standing relationships with them Material input prices and foreign exchange rates are also factors but are not considered significant in the context of the headroom available in the calculations.
b Cash Processing Solutions: Unit sales of large sorters and the extent of maintenance income generated from these sales are based on a combination of orders on hand and past experience.
The pre-tax discount rate used for both Currency and Cash Processing Solutions was 13.4 per cent 2009: 13.6 per cent.
The discount rates applied take into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC and the relative risks associated with the CGUs operations.
The post tax discount rate used is unchanged compared to the prior period, reflecting the fact that the Groups WACC has not changed and the risks associated with the CGUs in question have not materially changed.
Cash flows beyond the period covered by the projections have been held constant.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed and management do not consider there to be any reasonably possible change in assumptions that could result in the assets recoverable amounts falling below their book values.

The Group holds 10,000,000 redeemable shares of 1 each in Camelot Group plc.
The redeemable shares do not carry any voting rights, but rank equally with ordinary shares for dividend and return of capital purposes.
On 25 March 2010, the Group announced the proposed sale of its investment in Camelot Group plc, subject to National Lottery Commission approval, and the investment has therefore been reclassified as a non-current asset held for sale.

fide La Rue Annual Report 2010 73 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 15 Financial instruments Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk Currency risk Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to each of the above risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of capital are set out below.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has established the Risk Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Groups risk management policies.
The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury provides written principles for overall risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the Internal Audit function.
The Internal Audit function undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the result of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk.
The Group has one major customer where revenue attributable to sales transactions is significant.
Where appropriate, letters of credit are used to mitigate the credit risk from customers.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, unrecognised firm commitments and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
The Groups risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months to the extent that forecast transactions are highly probable.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
The Groups policy is to manage the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
74 fide La Rue Annual Report 2010 Business Review Corporate Governance Report Group Financial Statements Company Financial Statements Shareholders Information 15 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk All material financial assets and liabilities are maintained at floating rates of interest.
Where the Group has forecast average levels of debt above 50m on a continuing basis floating to fixed interest rate swaps will be used to fix the interest rate on a minimum of 50 per cent of the Groups debt for a period of at least 12 months.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing.
The Board of Directors monitors earnings per share, which the Group defines as the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Fair value measurement basis for derivative financial instruments The valuation bases are classified according to the degree of estimation required in arriving at the fair values.
Level 1 valuations are derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, level 2 valuations use observable inputs for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices, whilst level 3 valuations are not based on observable market data and are subject to management estimates.
Determination of fair values of derivative financial instruments Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are measured by reference to third party bank confirmations and discounted cash flows using the yield curves in effect at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales and purchase contracts and using quoted forwards foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The movement in fair value of embedded derivatives is shown within revenue or operating expenses as appropriate, depending on the nature of the transaction.
Determination of fair values of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities Trade and other receivables and payables Due to their short maturities, the fair values of trade payables, trade receivables and accruals have been stated at their book values.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on sterling LIBOR.
At 27 March 2010 the discount rate used was 1.0 per cent 2009: 1.90 per cent.

The Group has reduced its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk through interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of 50m, which have the effect of fixing the interest cost on 50m of borrowings under the Groups committed bank facility until May 2011 at an average rate of 3.49 per cent inclusive of borrowing margin.
Where the Group has forecast average levels of net debt above 50m on a continuing basis, Group policy is to maintain a minimum of 50 per cent of the Groups average net debt fixed for a period of at least 12 months.
As at 27 March 2010 25m of the interest rate swaps were treated as ineffective because of reduced levels of sterling debt.

Reconciliations of option movements over the year to 27 March 2010 for each class of options are shown below: Executive Share Option Plan The Executive Share Option Plan was open to eligible senior executives around the Group.
Options were granted at a price equal to the average market price of a share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant with a performance condition based on the achievement of an earnings per share growth target.
The performance condition relates to the achievement over three years of three per cent per annum earnings per share growth over the rate of increase in the retail price index.
If this condition is not met at the end of the performance period the options will lapse.
For grants of options before April 2004 retesting of the performance target will be allowed twice, on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.
A pre vesting forfeiture rate of 5 per cent per annum has been assumed.
