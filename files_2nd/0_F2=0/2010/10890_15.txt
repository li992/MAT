Provisions for liabilities and charges Deferred Environmental Emissions Restructuring taxation Other Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2009 56 2 43 808 48 957 Charged to profit and loss account 14 4 28 27 11 84 Transferred to reserves - - - 18 - 18 Utilised 2 - 25 - 10 37 Released ---- 2 2 Unwinding of discount 2---- 2 At 31 March 2010 70 6 46 817 47 986 Environmental provision The environmental provision represents the net present value of the estimated statutory decontamination costs of old gas manufacturing sites owned by National Grid Gas plc discounted using a nominal rate of 2.0%.
The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
We have made our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2010 relating to gas site decontamination was 110m 2009: 85m, being the best undiscounted estimate of the liability having regard to the uncertainties referred to above.
Emissions provision The provision for emission costs is expected to be settled using emission allowances granted or purchased.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2010, 26m of the total restructuring provision 2009: 19m related to the restructuring of our Liquefied Natural Gas LNG storage facilities and 5m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties 2009: 5m.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, to be paid over the next two years.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2010 include 6m 2009: 12m in respect of property transfer costs related to the sales of four UK gas distribution networks and 21m 2009: 21m in respect of employer liability claims.
The payment dates for the property transfer costs are uncertain but should largely be over the next two years.
In accordance with insurance industry practice, the estimates for employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.
Deferred taxation comprises: 2010 2009 m m Accelerated capital allowances 832 796 Other timing differences 15 12 817 808 Deferred tax assets in respect of capital losses of 15m 2009: 24m have not been recognised as their future recovery is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
The capital losses are available to carry forward indefinitely.
The capital losses can be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
There are no other significant unrecognised deferred tax assets or liabilities 2009: nil.

e Litigation and claims We reported in previous Annual Reports and Accounts a decision by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority GEMA to fine National Grid 41.6m for a breach of the UK Competition Act 1998 in respect of term contracts with gas suppliers entered into by our metering services business in 2004.
This decision was overturned in part and the fine reduced to 30m by the Competition Appeal Tribunal in April 2009 and the fine was further reduced to 15m by the Court of Appeal in a reserved judgement not otherwise affecting the Competition Appeal Tribunal's judgement issued in February 2010.
On 22 March 2010, National Grid applied for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's judgement to the Supreme Court.
As at 31 March 2010, we have provided for the fine together with associated costs and have provided against certain trade receivables and other balance sheet items.
Without prejudice to our position in relation to appealing the Court of Appeal's judgement, the 15m fine was paid to GEMA on 1 April 2010.
In October 2008, we informed Ofgem that our mains replacement activity carried out by the Distribution business may have been misreported.
Ofgem's investigation continues, so that at present it is too early to determine the likely outcome of the investigation, including the quantum of any amounts likely to be payable and any potential consequences as a result of it.
