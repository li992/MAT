The Tier 2 preference shares and the B shares were classified as loans and borrowings under IFRS due to their underlying characteristics being those of debt instruments.
Immediately prior to Listing, the Companys share capital was restructured with the A shares and B shares being subdivided into 50 shares of 2p each and converted into, and re-designated as, ordinary shares.
The Tier 1 preference shares and Tier 2 preference shares were subdivided into 50 shares of 2p each.
Of these, a proportion was converted into ordinary shares such that the value was equal to the aggregate entitlement of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 preference shares at the date of Listing, including the catch-up entitlement of 10.4m on the Tier 1 preference shares and the accrued cumulative fixed dividend of 8.0m on the Tier 2 preference shares.
The Tier 1 catch-up entitlement represents a transaction solely within equity and is therefore not recorded in the financial statements, other than as a deduction to net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent in calculating earnings per share.
The settlement of the 8.0m accrued cumulative fixed dividend on the Tier 2 preference shares with ordinary shares has been recognised in other reserves as part of the capital reorganisation.
The remainder of the sub-divided Tier 1 and Tier 2 preference shares representing the balance of the pre-Listing legal share price of 54.1m were converted into and re-designated as deferred shares.
Subsequent to Listing, the deferred shares were purchased for an aggregate cost of 1 and cancelled, and the 54.1m re-designated as capital redemption reserve.
On Listing a further 133.5m new ordinary shares were issued and 29.7m new ordinary shares were issued as consideration for the acquisition of a portion of the Preferred Finance Securities, with an associated 266.0m of share premium being recognised.
10.3m of Listing expenses are deducted from this in order to derive the share premium account balance of 255.7m.
