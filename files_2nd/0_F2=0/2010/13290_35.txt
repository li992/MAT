Therefore it is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs, which are currently the statutory entities acquired.
This is the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is monitored for impairment and is at a lower level than the Groups operating segments.
2010 2009 The analysis of acquired goodwill on consolidation is: 000 000 Acquisition of itp GmbH 2,372 2,372 Acquisition of Renishaw Diagnostics Limited 84.8% 2009 75% formerly D3 Technologies Limited 1,784 1,784 Acquisition of Renishaw Mayfield S. A.
75% 1,215 1,215 Acquisition of PulseTeq Limited 75% 198 198 Total acquired goodwill 5,569 5,569 The recoverable amounts of acquired goodwill are based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections with assumptions as follows: itp GmbH part of the metrology reportable segment - actual operating results and an average growth rate of 5% for 5 years with a nil terminal growth rate 2009 same basis.
Renishaw Diagnostics Limited, PulseTeq Limited and Renishaw Mayfield S. A. all in the healthcare reportable segment - 5 year business plans with a nil terminal growth rate 2009 same basis.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows of itp GmbH 2009 13% and 15% for Renishaw Diagnostics Limited 2009 13%, PulseTeq Limited 2009 13% and Renishaw Mayfield S. A.
These have been set on the basis of these being appropriate rates for a market participant.
On this basis, no impairment write downs are required.
There is significant headroom in all the above and for an impairment to arise, there would need to be a significant material deterioration in business: this is considered to be remote.
An increase in 5% in the discount rate would not result in an impairment.
