6 discontinued operations Uganda On 18 December 2009, Heritage announced that the Company and HOGL had entered into a SPA, with Eni for the sale of the Ugandan Assets and on 17 January 2010, Tullow exercised its rights of pre-emption.
The sale of the Ugandan Assets completed on 26 July 2010: Tullow paid cash of $1.45 billion, including $100 million from a contractual settlement, of which Heritage received and retained $1.045 billion.
The URA contends that income tax is due on the capital gain arising on the disposal and it raised assessments amounting to $404,925,000 prior to completion of the disposal.
Heritages position, based on comprehensive advice from leading legal and tax experts in Uganda, the United Kingdom and North America, is that no tax should be payable in Uganda on the disposal of the Ugandan Assets.
Financial Statements 2010 heritage oil plc 23 6 discontinued operations continued In order to allow the disposal to proceed, the Group agreed with Tullow a mechanism to provide Government with security over the disputed amounts through depositing some of the proceeds with the URA and placing a further amount in escrow.
Tullow paid cash consideration of $1.35 billion and an additional contractual settlement amount of $100 million.
On closing, Heritage deposited $121,477,000 with the URA, amounting to 30% of the disputed tax assessment of $404,925,000.
$121,477,000 has been classified as a deposit in the balance sheet at 31 December 2010.
A further $283,447,000 has been retained in escrow, pursuant to an agreement between HOGL, Tullow and Standard Chartered Bank pending resolution between Government and HOGL of the tax dispute.
Including accrued interest, an amount of $286,603,000 is classified as restricted cash in the balance sheet at 31 December 2010.
In August 2010, the URA issued a further income tax assessment of $30 million representing 30% of additional contractual settlement amount of $100 million.
HOGL disputed this assessment and no provision has been made for this amount.
There is a tax tribunal ongoing in Uganda, and HOGL continues to review options to recover monies held in relation to the Uganda tax dispute, which could include arbitration in London.
Although disputes of this nature are inherently uncertain, the Directors believe that the monies on deposit and held in escrow account will ultimately be recovered by Heritage.
As at 31 December 2010, working capital adjustments with respect to the disposal of the Ugandan Assets of $13.6 million was owed by Tullow.
On 15 April 2011, Heritage and its wholly owned subsidiary HOGL received Particulars of Claim filed in the High Court of Justice in England by Tullow seeking $313,447,500 for alleged breach of contract as a result of HOGLs and Heritages refusal to reimburse Tullow in relation to a payment made by Tullow of $313,447,500 on 7 April 2011 to the URA.
Heritage and HOGL believe that the claim has no basis and will vigorously and robustly defend it.
Heritage and HOGL have also reserved their other rights against Tullow and against Government.
On 15 April 2011, HOGL sent a request to Tullow, as a co-signatory to the escrow account with Standard Chartered Bank, for the release of $283,447,000 plus interest to HOGL.
HOGL contends that, consequent on Tullows admission that its payment of $313,447,500 to the URA has discharged HOGLs alleged tax liability, funds no longer need to be held in escrow.
