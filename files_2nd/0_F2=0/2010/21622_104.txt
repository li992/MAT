Notes to the Financial Statements continued 18.
Risk Management policies and procedures continued v Liquidity and credit risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity and credit risk is not significant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 30 million 2009: 30 million and a multi-currency loan facility of 70 million 2009: 70 million.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amounts of the Groups resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Group should remain 75% invested in normal market conditions and that 25% of the Groups assets may be invested in cash or cash equivalents.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity and credit risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, was as follows: Not more 3 months than More than or less one year one year Total 2010 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and bank overdrafts 30,881 30,881 Amounts due to brokers, accruals and provisions 16,667 4,063 20,730 47,548 4,063 51,611 Not more 3 months than More than or less one year one year Total 2009 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and bank overdrafts 41,950 41,950 Amounts due to brokers, accruals and provisions 4,230 4,230 46,180 46,180 The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account so as to determine the risk to the Group of default: transactions involving derivatives are either exchange traded where the relevant exchange guarantees settlement or on an over the counter basis.
Transactions are entered into only with those counterparties approved by the credit department of the Investment Manager.
Counterparties are selected on the basis of a number of risk migration criteria designed to reduce the risk to the Group of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the credit worthiness of financial institutions with whom cash is held is reviewed regularly by the Investment Manager: 50 BlackRock World Mining Trust plc
