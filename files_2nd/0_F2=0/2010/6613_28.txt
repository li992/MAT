GSK Annual Report 2010 Financial statements P102P191 Business review P08P57 Governance and remuneration P58P101 Financial statements P102P191 Shareholder information P192P212 117 Notes to the financial statements 6 Segment information GSK has revised its segmental information disclosures to reect changes in the internal reporting structures with effect from 1st January 2010.
ViiV Healthcare is now shown as a separate segment.
Stiefel has been integrated with the GSK heritage dermatology business and is reported within the relevant geographical pharmaceutical segments.
The other trading and other unallocated pharmaceuticals information has been combined.
In addition, the responsibility for certain products in two small markets moved from the pharmaceuticals business to Consumer Healthcare.
Comparative information has been restated onto a consistent basis.
GSKs operating segments are being reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Executive officer, who is regarded as the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, and the responsibilities of the Corporate Executive Team CET.
Individual members of the CET are responsible for geographic regions of the Pharmaceuticals business, ViiV Healthcare and for the Consumer Healthcare business as a whole, respectively, before major restructuring.
No geographic information is regularly provided to the CODM.
R&D investment is essential for the sustainability of the pharmaceutical businesses.
However, for segment reporting, the USA, Europe, Emerging Markets and Asia Pacic Japan regional pharmaceutical operating profits exclude allocations of globally funded R&D as well as central costs, principally corporate functions and unallocated manufacturing costs.
GSKs management reporting process allocates all intra-Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.
The Other trading and unallocated pharmaceuticals segment includes Canada, Puerto Rico, central vaccine tender sales and contract manufacturing sales, together with costs such as vaccines R&D, central dermatology costs and central manufacturing costs not attributed to other segments.
The Pharmaceuticals R&D segment which excludes vaccines R&D is the responsibility of the Chairman, Research & Development and is therefore being reported as a separate segment.
Corporate and other unallocated costs and disposal profits include corporate functions, costs for legal matters, fair value movements on financial instruments and investments and unallocated profits on asset disposals.

7 Major restructuring programme In October 2007, GSK announced a significant new Operational Excellence programme to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its operations.
A significant expansion of the Operational Excellence programme was approved by the Board and announced in February 2009.
A further expansion was approved by the Board and announced in February 2010, when total approved costs for the implementation of the expanded programme were increased from 3.6 billion to approximately 4.5 billion, over the period from 2007 to 2012.
Approximately 75% of these costs were incurred by 31st December 2010, and approximately 20% are expected to be incurred in 2011 with the balance in 2012.
In total, approximately 75% of these costs are expected to be cash expenditures and 25% are expected to be asset write-downs.
Uncertainties exist over the exact amount and timing of cash outows as a result of potential future exchange rate uctuations and as many elements of the restructuring programme are subject to employee consultation procedures, making it difficult to predict with precision when these procedures will be completed.
However, the majority of the remaining cash payments are expected to be made in 2011 and 2012.
The programme remains on track to deliver total annual pre-tax savings of 2.2 billion by 2012, with savings realised across the business.
Of the total restructuring costs of 1,345 million incurred in 2010, 1,242 million was incurred under the Operational Excellence programme in the following areas: s COST SAVING PR OJECTS IN 2 $ FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE SIMPLIlCATION AND STREAMLINING OF SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING SOME SITE rationalisations, principally Verona in Italy and Harlow and Tonbridge in the UK: s THE ADOPTION OF MORE CUSTOMISED SALES APPROACHES LEADING TO STAFF REDUCTIONS IN A NUMBER OF SALES FORCES PRINCIPALLY IN THE 53!

The percentages within the above reconciliation are exacerbated by the relatively low reported profit.
The Group operates in countries where the tax rate differs from the UK tax rate.
The impact of these overseas taxes on the overall rate of tax is shown above.
profits arising from certain operations in Singapore are accorded special status and are taxed at reduced rates compared with the normal rates of tax in that territory.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 1.6p in 2010, 2.8p in 2009 and 2.8p in 2008.
The Group is required under IFRS to create a deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised inter-company profit arising on inventory held by the Group at the year-end by applying the tax rate of the country in which the inventory is held rather than the tax rate of the country where the profit was originally made and the tax paid, which is the practice under UK and US GAAP.
As a result of this difference in accounting treatment the Group tax rate on current period inter-company profit under IFRS increased by 1.7% in 2010 2009 0.5% increase: 2008 2.1% increase arising from changes in the location of work-inprogress and nished goods.

GSK Annual Report 2010 128 Notes to the financial statements 14 Taxation continued Issues relating to taxation The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets.
This gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GSK.
During the year GSK agreed and settled further open years with major tax authorities up to and including 2008.
In Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned a judgement of the Tax Court of Canada in respect of GSKs transfer pricing in the early 1990s and remanded the case back to the Tax Court for reconsideration.
The parties are seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
GSK continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities or litigation where appropriate.
No provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiaries, on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of these unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 30 billion 2009 29 billion.
The deferred tax on unremitted earnings at 31st December 2010 is estimated to be 500 million 2009 500 million, which relates to taxes payable on repatriation and dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions.
UK legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject to certain exceptions.

All other deferred tax movements arise from the origination and reversal of temporary differences.
Other net temporary differences mainly include accrued expenses for which a tax deduction is only available on a paid basis.

Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses.
Factors affecting the tax charge in future years As a global organisation there are many factors which could affect the future effective tax rate of the Group.
The mix of profits across different territories, transfer pricing and other disputes with tax authorities and the location of research and development activity can all have a significant impact on the Groups effective tax rate.
Changes to tax legislation in territories where GSK has business operations could also impact the Groups effective tax rate.
The UK Government has proposed some significant changes to the UK taxation system.
In June 2010 the UK Government announced a phased reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% over 4 years from April 2011.
The deferred tax movements reect the reduction in the UK tax rate from 28% to 27% as it has been substantively enacted.
In November 2010 the UK Government reconrmed its intention to introduce a patent box regime which would apply a reduced rate of corporation tax to income from patents with effect from April 2013, following a period of consultation.
The UK Government also continues to consult with business on proposed changes to legislation relating to controlled foreign companies.
The majority of these changes are expected to be enacted in 2012.

The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the ESOP Trusts.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using results before major restructuring earnings.
The calculation of results before major restructuring is described in Note 1 Presentation of the financial statements.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
A potentially dilutive share forms part of the employee share schemes where its exercise price is below the average market price of GSK shares during the period and any performance conditions attaching to the scheme have been met at the balance sheet date.

GSK normally pays a dividend two quarters after the quarter to which it relates and one quarter after it is declared.
The 2010 financial statements recognise those dividends paid in 2010, namely the third and fourth interim dividends for 2009 and the first and second interim dividends for 2010.

Included in land and buildings at 31st December 2010 are leased assets with a cost of 582 million 2009 561 million, accumulated depreciation of 280 million 2009 261 million, impairment of nil 2009 nil and a net book value of 302 million 2009 300 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31st December 2010 are leased assets with a cost of 95 million 2009 126 million, accumulated depreciation of 54 million 2009 44 million, and a net book value of 41 million 2009 82 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
The value in use calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash ows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specic risks.
Where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash ow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash ows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 11%.
The impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales 142 million 2009 95 million, R&D 46 million 2009 47 million and SG&A 17 million 2009 18 million, and include 57 million 2009 57 million arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.

This loss is reported in the consolidated income statement under the major restructuring programme within selling, general and administration.
The additions in the year, translated at acquisition exchange rates, arose primarily on the acquisition of Laboratorios Phoenix S. A. I. C. yF.
See Note 38, Acquisitions and disposals for further details.

With effect from 1st January 2010, GSK revised its segmental disclosures to reect changes in the internal reporting structure.
ViiV Healthcare is now shown as a separate segment and the Stiefel business has been integrated with the GSK legacy dermatology business.
Following these changes, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Stiefel has been allocated to the US, Europe, Emerging Markets, Asia Pacic and Other pharmaceuticals CGUs for impairment testing purposes as the benets of the acquired business are expected to arise from these businesses.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions of ID Biomedical, Sirtris Pharmaceuticals and Domantis has been split between the US, Europe, Emerging Markets, Asia Pacic, Japan and Other pharmaceutical CGUs for impairment testing purposes as either the benefit of the acquired businesses is split among the CGUs or the acquired businesses do not generate independent cash ows.
In 2010, the allocation of Polfa Poznan S. A. goodwill has changed from Poland pharmaceuticals to the Europe pharmaceuticals cash generating unit.
This change of allocation reects the level at which GSK internal management monitors the Polfa Poznan S. A. goodwill.
The valuation of the US pharmaceuticals cash generating unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes, has been prepared on a fair value less costs to sell basis, using turnover and earnings multiples derived from observed market data.
The recoverable amounts of the other cash generating units are assessed using either a value in use or a fair value less costs to sell model.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash ows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated.
Initially a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash ows.
The post-tax discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 8%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group.
The discount rate is increased where specic country risks are sufciently significant to have a material impact on the outcome of the impairment test.
Where the impairment test indicates that the recoverable value of the unit is close to or below its carrying value, the test is reperformed using a pre-tax discount rate and pre-tax cash ows in order to determine if an impairment exists and to establish its magnitude.
Fair value is calculated using a similar discounted cash ow approach based on the Groups acquisition valuation model.
A post-tax discount rate is applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash ows and terminal value.

The terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for the relevant markets.
The terminal growth rates used in the value in use calculations for the pharmaceuticals cash generating units reect the impact of future generic competition and take no account of new product launches.
The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 1.83 billion 2009 1.79 billion.
The pharmaceutical cash generating units also comprise a collection of smaller cash generating units including assets with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 708 million 2009 660 million.
Details of indefinite life brands are given in Note 19 Other intangible assets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk proles, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment applying a fair value less costs to sell methodology, generally using four year post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country-specic risks.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between 2% and 3% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these brands.

Quest Diagnostics Inc. a US clinical laboratory business listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The investment had a book value at 31st December 2010 of 494 million 2009 410 million and a market value of 1,064 million 2009 1,153 million.
Although the Group held less than 20% of the ownership interest and voting control in Quest, the Group had the ability to exercise significant inuence through both its significant shareholding and its nominated directors active participation on the Quest Board of Directors and Board sub-committees.
Subsequent to the year-end GSK sold its entire shareholding in Quest Diagnostics Inc.
The sale comprised a secondary public offering and an accompanying repurchase of shares by Quest Diagnostics which together are expected to generate gross proceeds of $1.1 billion 0.7 billion after tax.
At 31st December 2010, the Group owned 81.7 million shares or 19% of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited.
Aspen, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, is Africas largest pharmaceutical manufacturer and a major supplier of branded and generic pharmaceutical, healthcare and nutritional products to the southern African and selected international markets.
The investment had a book value at 31st December 2010 of 397 million 2009 372 million and a market value of 729 million 2009 505 million.
Although the Group holds less than 20% of the ownership interest and voting control of Aspen, the Group has the ability to exercise significant inuence through both its shareholding and its nominated directors active participation on the Aspen Board of Directors.
The transfer from other investments in 2010 relates to the Groups holding in JCR Pharmaceuticals Ltd, previously classied within Other investments.
Summarised balance sheet information in respect of the Groups associates is set out below: 2010 2009 m m Total assets: Quest Diagnostics Inc. 5,466 5,319 Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited 1,913 1,318 Others 360 121 7,739 6,758 Total liabilities: Quest Diagnostics Inc. 2,868 2,828 Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited 786 689 Others 73 19 3,727 3,536 Net assets 4,012 3,222 The summarised balance sheet information in respect of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited is based on preliminary results information and analysts forecasts available at 31st December 2010.
Investments in joint ventures comprise 66 million share of gross assets 2009 57 million and 12 million share of gross liabilities 2009 11 million.
These principally arise from 50% interests in two joint ventures, Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare Holdings, L. P. which is developing specified chemical compounds, and ViiV Shire Canada, which primarily co-markets Combivir, Trizivir and Epivir in certain territories, both of which are now part of the ViiV Healthcare business.
Investments in joint ventures also include a 28% interest in Pharmaceutical Insurance Limited, which is a mutual insurance company covering pharmaceutical business risk, and a 49% interest in GlaxoSmithKline - NeptunusBio, which is a u vaccine research, development and manufacturing venture.
During 2010, GSK made additional capital contributions of 6 million to Shenzhan GlaxoSmithKline - NeptunusBio Co. Ltd and 24 million to Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare Holdings, L. P.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by management with reference to relevant available information, including the current market value of similar instruments and discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Other investments include listed investments of 491 million 2009 245 million, the increase primarily arising from a number of additional investments during the year.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassied from equity to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times.
The transfer to associates relates to the Groups holding in JCR Pharmaceuticals, which increased during the year to 27%.
The impairment losses recorded in the tables above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within other operating income, together with amounts reclassied from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.

Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.
Trade and other payables include 26 million 2009 23 million due to associates and joint ventures.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid dened benefit schemes also include dened contribution sections.

In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reect the term of the expected benefit payments.
The expected rate of return on bonds reects the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds.
An equity risk premium of between 3% and 4% is added to longer term government bond yields to give the expected rate of return on equities.
Projected ination rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the PCA00 standard mortality tables to reect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reect improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort i. e. improvements at recently observed higher levels which are assumed to continue to 2020 with minimum improvements thereafter of 1% per year for both males and females.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2030 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.4 28.7 24.6 26.3 Projected for 2030 29.7 30.5 26.5 27.4 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specic assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
Following an asset liability study in 2007, the Group decided to adopt a strategy to reduce gradually the allocation of investment in equities.
During 2009, it was agreed that the pace of reallocation would be increased primarily through investment of the deficit reduction contributions in bonds.
The target allocation of equities and property in the US scheme has been reduced to 50% of the total.
In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.

The exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk is minimised by matching local currency income with local currency costs.
For this purpose, our internal trading transactions are matched centrally and we manage inter-company payment terms to reduce foreign currency risk.
Exceptional foreign currency cash ows are hedged selectively under the management of Corporate Treasury.
We manage the cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrally using forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency.
We seek to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principal assets and cash ows.
These are primarily denominated in US dollars, Euros and Sterling.
Certain borrowings can be swapped into other currencies as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as a hedge against the relevant assets.
Forward contracts are also used in major currencies to reduce our exposure to our investment in overseas Group assets see Net investment hedges section of this note for further details.
The TMG reviews the ratio of borrowings to assets for major currencies monthly.
Credit risk The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 12,285 million 2009 13,434 million which is the total of the Groups financial assets with the exception of Other investments which do not bear credit risk.

Treasury-related credit risk GSK has continued to maintain its conservative approach to counterparty risk throughout this period.
A report on relationship banks and their credit ratings is presented annually to the TMG for approval.
The aggregate credit risk in respect of financial instruments the Group may have with one counterparty is limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moodys and Standard and Poors.
The table below sets out the credit ratings of counterparties for liquid investments, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives.
The gross asset position on each derivative contract is considered for the purpose of this table, though, under the ISDA contracts, the amount at risk is the net position with each counterparty.
The 92 million invested in Baa3 BBBrated investments includes bank deposits with Allied Irish Bank and State Bank of India and Indian Government bonds.
These counterparties are used either for local cash management purposes or for local investment purposes where GSK is not the sole shareholder.

Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The tables below show the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar, Euro and Yen financial instruments excluding obligations under finance leases and certain non-derivative financial instruments not in net debt and which do not present a material exposure.
These three currencies are the major foreign currencies in which GSKs financial instruments are denominated.
GSK has considered movements in these currencies over the last three years and has concluded that a 20% movement in rates is a reasonable benchmark.
In the table below, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Inter-company loans which are fully hedged to maturity with a currency swap have been excluded from this analysis.
2010 2009 Increase Reduction Increase Reduction in income in equity in income in equity Non-functional currency foreign exchange exposure m m m m 20% appreciation of the US dollar 386 214 755 20% appreciation of the Euro 35 1,697 72 1,779 20% appreciation of the Yen 545 A 20% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movements in the income statement relate primarily to hedging instruments for US legal provisions, and to trade payables and trade receivables.
Whilst the hedging instruments provide economic hedges, the related provisions are not financial instruments and therefore are not included in the table above.
The combined sensitivity of these hedging instruments and the provisions would be insignicant if the provisions were included.
The movements in equity relate to foreign exchange positions used to hedge Group assets denominated in Euro.
The US dollar and Yen positions were closed out in 2010.
Therefore, a depreciation on the currency swap would give rise to a corresponding appreciation on the Group asset.
Foreign exchange sensitivity on Group assets other than financial instruments is not included above.

These derivatives relate primarily to foreign exchange contracts used to hedge the Groups currency net assets and US legal provisions.
2010 2009 Increase decrease Increase decrease in net debt in net debt Impact of foreign exchange movements on net debt m m 20% appreciation of the US dollar 851 523 20% appreciation of the Euro 606 686 20% appreciation of the Yen 13 89 A 20% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its oating rate Sterling, US dollar and Euro financial instruments, being the currencies in which GSK has historically issued debt and held investments.
GSK has considered movements in these interest rates over the last three years and has concluded that a 2% 200 basis points increase is a reasonable benchmark.
Debt with a maturity of less than one year is oating rate for this calculation.
A 2% 200 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.
2010 2009 Increase decrease Increase decrease in income in income m m 2% 200 basis points increase in Sterling interest rates 29 2 2% 200 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 18 38 2% 200 basis points increase in Euro interest rates 37 18 These interest rates could not be decreased by 2% as they are currently less than 1.0%.
The maximum increase decrease in income would therefore be limited to 8 million, 2 million and 11 million for Sterling, US Dollar and Euro interest rates respectively 2009 1 million, 4 million and 2 million.
Interest rate movements on foreign currency derivatives and other financial instruments not in net debt do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet based on a 2% increase or decrease in these interest rates.
Contractual cash ows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following is an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
The impact of interest rate swaps has been excluded.
For the purpose of this table, debt is dened as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31st December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash ows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31st December.

Changes in fair value are taken to the income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company lending and borrowing.
Cash ow hedges The Group entered into a number of foreign exchange forward contracts and designated them as a cash ow hedge of the exchange arising on the US dollar purchase consideration of a highly probable business acquisition.
The acquisition occurred in October 2010 and the cash ow hedge matured at that date.
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income in 2010 was removed upon maturity of the hedge and included in the initial carrying value of goodwill and intangibles recorded on the acquisition of the entity.
The Group has also entered into a number of foreign exchange forward contracts and designated them as cash ow hedges of the exchange exposure arising on the GBP equivalent interest cost on Euro loans issued and settled in July and December 2010.
The net fair value movements on cash ow hedges are disclosed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
No ineffectiveness was recorded on cash ow hedges during 2010.

The risk being hedged is the variability of the fair value of the bond arising from interest rate uctuations.
Gains and losses on fair value hedges are disclosed in Note 12, Finance costs.
Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk principally arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its US Dollar, Euro and Yen foreign operations.
At 31st December 2010, the Group held such net investment hedges only in respect of its Euro foreign operations.
In addition, Euro loan capital of 5.85 billion issued in previous years is designated as a net investment hedge in respect of the foreign currency translation risk principally arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its Euro operations.
Net investment hedge ineffectiveness is disclosed in Note 11, Finance income.
42 Employee share schemes The Group operates share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at the grant price, savings-related share option schemes and share award schemes.
In addition, GSK operates the Performance Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets and the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to certain employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee and from 2010 onwards, no further grants will be made under the savings-related share option schemes.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants of restricted shares and share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting performance period.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Grants under share option schemes and awards under the Performance Share Plan are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GSK plc but in some circumstances will be settled in cash.
Options under the share option schemes are granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Share options awarded to the Directors and, with effect from the 2004 grant, the CET are subject to performance criteria.
Option pricing For the purposes of valuing options and awards to arrive at the share based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model for 2008, 2009 and 2010 are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Risk-free interest rate 0.8% 1.9% 1.4% 2.9% 1.3% 4.8% Dividend yield 5.3% 5.2% 4.8% Volatility 26% 29% 23% 29% 19% 24% Expected lives of options granted under: Share option schemes 5 years 5 years 5 years Savings-related share option and share award schemes 3-4 years 3-4 years 3 years Weighted average share price for grants in the year: Ordinary Shares 12.04 11.72 11.59 ADS $37.29 $33.73 $45.02 Volatility is determined based on the three and five year share price history where appropriate.
The fair value of performance share plan grants take into account market conditions.
Expected lives of options were determined based on weighted average historic exercises of options.
There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a three year measurement period.
Awards granted to Directors and members of the CET prior to 2009 are subject to a single performance condition which compares GSKs TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the comparator group over the same period.
For awards granted in 2009 and 2010 to Directors and members of the CET, 40% of the award is based on the achievement of adjusted free cash ow targets over a three year measurement period.
The remaining 60% of the award is based on relative TSR performance against a comparator group as described on pages 85 and 87.
Half of the TSR element of each award is measured over three years and half over four years.
For those awards made to all other eligible employees prior to 2009 the performance conditions consist of two parts, each of which applies to 50% of the award.
The first part of the performance condition compares GSKs EPS growth to the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year measurement period.
The second part of the performance condition compares GSKs TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the comparator group over the same period.
For awards granted from 2009 onwards, the first part of the performance condition continues to be based on EPS.
The second part of the performance condition is based on strategic or operational business measures, over a three year measurement period, specic to the employees business area.
