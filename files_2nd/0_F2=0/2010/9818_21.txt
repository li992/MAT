FINaNCIaL stateMeNts Notes For the 52 weeks ended 2 October 2010 1 aCCoUNtINg PoLICIes Basis of preparation The Company financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain freehold and leasehold properties, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.
related party disclosures The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the Group.
revenue and other operating income Revenue represents rents receivable from licensed properties, which is recognised in respect of the period to which it relates.
Other operating income comprises mainly rents from unlicensed properties.
Current and deferred tax The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date that give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and profits as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and assets are only recognised where recoverability is probable.
Fixed assets Freehold and leasehold properties are stated at valuation or at cost.
Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis to provide for the cost of the assets less residual value over their useful lives.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated over the life of the lease.
Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
Own labour and interest costs directly attributable to capital projects are capitalised.
Properties are revalued by qualified valuers at least once in each rolling five year period, on an existing use basis.
When a valuation is below current carrying value, the asset concerned is reviewed for impairment.
Impairment losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain has been recorded, and thereafter to the profit and loss account.
Surpluses on revaluation are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where they reverse previously charged impairment losses, in which case they are recorded in the profit and loss account.
assets held for sale Assets, typically properties, are categorised as held for sale when the value of the asset will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
This condition is met when the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is being actively marketed.
In addition, the Company must be committed to the sale and the completion should be expected to occur within one year from the date of classification.
Assets held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
Disposals of fixed assets Profit loss on disposal of fixed assets represents net sale proceeds less carrying value of the assets.
Any element of the revaluation reserve relating to the fixed assets disposed of is transferred to the profit and loss reserve at the date of sale.

Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision for diminution in value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
