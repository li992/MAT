Financial statements 108 Notes to the accounts 29 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Groups operations: market risk including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash ow and fair value risks: Cash ow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will uctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at xed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically at oating rates linked to LIBOR.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate uctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash ows by using oating to xed interest rate swaps.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating to xed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its xed rate derivative financial instruments, as discussed in the Financial review on pages 42 to 48.
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings prole of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2010 2010 2009 2009 m m m m Borrowings 6.8 657.8 7.0 719.4 Derivative impact nominal value of interest rate swaps 624.7 624.7 684.8 684.8 Borrowings prole net of derivative impact 631.5 33.1 691.8 34.6 Interest rate protection 95.0% 95.2% Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate of interest rates swaps currently effective is 4.8 per cent 2009 5.0 per cent.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of 9.8 million 2009 11.6 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would be a negative movement of 9.8 million 2009 11.8 million in the fair value of derivatives.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are dealt with in the income statement.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur.
Because the xed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by short-term oating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash ow of such a movement would be very small.
b Foreign exchange risk The Groups largest exposure to foreign exchange movements is in respect of its investments in two Chinese investment funds which are denominated in US dollars.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge foreign currency exposures that are less than 15 per cent of its net assets.
Foreign currency exposures in excess of this amount, as far as practicable, will be hedged by borrowing in foreign currencies and through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2010 by 6.0 million 2009 increased the net loss taken directly to equity by 4.2million.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent weakening of sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2010 by 6.6 million 2009 decreased the net loss taken directly to equity by 4.6 million.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commitments.
The Groups treasury policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entities ability to meet the relevant facilities financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
A detailed analysis of the Groups financial covenant position is set out on page 134 in Other information.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to renancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity prole of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Re-nancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired re-nancing.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a oating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

Capital & Counties Properties PLC Report & Accounts 2010 Financial statements 110 Notes to the accounts 29 Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits and loans.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2010 is 1.
In relation to the Groups exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are fully provided against.
Additionally, specic provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability issues.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is the Groups policy to calculate any impairment specically on each contract.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: Group Group 2010 2009 m m Up to three months 9.8 5.9 Over three months 0.4 1.9 Trade receivables 10.2 7.8 Also included within receivables are 6.3 million 2009 8.2 million of loan notes.
All loan notes have been reviewed for potential impairment and are considered to be receivable as at the year end.
In 2010 trade receivables impaired amounted to 0.4 million 2009 0.6 million, this is considered to be an immaterial amount and within budgeted levels given current economic conditions.
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

The fair values of quoted borrowings are based on the bid price.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield curves at 31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash ows to the net present values.

The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and exibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest coverage ratio.
The Group aims not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 45 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent.
These are discussed in the Financial review on pages 42 to 48.

The different levels are dened as follows: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets.
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices.
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.
