NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2010 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Statement of compliance Michael Page International plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with current International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of Michael Page International plc consolidate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the pro t and loss account of the Company has not been included as part of these financial statements.
The Companys pro t for the financial year amounted to 45.0m 2009: 73.6m.
The decrease in the Companys pro t this year is as a result of decreased dividend income.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Refer to page 28 for further details.
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
iii Employee Bene t Trust Shares in Michael Page International plc held by the trust are shown as a reduction in shareholders funds.
Other assets and liabilities held by the trust are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
The policies, set out below, have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
New standards and interpretations The accounting policies applied by the Group in these Consolidated Financial Statements are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2009 except as described below.
a New and amended standards adopted by the group The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010.
None of these new standards or amendments to standards have had a signi cant impact on the Group.
IAS 27 revised requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also speci es the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in pro t or loss.
IAS 27 revised has had no impact on the current period, as all subsidiaries in the Group are 100% owned: there have been no transactions whereby an interest in an entity is retained after the loss of control of that entity, and there have been no transactions with non-controlling interests.
IFRS 2 amendments, Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions, effective form 1 January 2010.
In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2, and IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions, the amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classi cation of group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation.
b New and amended standards, and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 but not currently relevant to the group although they may affect the accounting for future transactions and events.
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 or later periods, but the group has not early adopted them.
64 Michael Page International FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED New standards and interpretations continued IAS 1 amendment 2009, Presentation of financial statements.
The amendment clari es that the potential settlement of a liability by the issue of equity is not relevant to its classi cation as current or non current.
By amending the fide nition of current liability, the amendment permits a liability to be classi ed as non-current provided that the entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement by transfer of cash or other assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period notwithstanding the fact that the entity could be required by the counterparty to settle in shares at any time.
IAS 36 amendment, Impairment of assets, effective 1 January 2010.
The amendment clari es that the largest cash-generating unit or group of units to which goodwill should be allocated for the purposes of impairment testing is an operating segment, as fide ned by paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, Operating segments that is, before the aggregation of segments with similar economic characteristics.
IFRS 3 revised, Business combinations, and consequential amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and separate financial statements, IAS 28, Investments in associates, and IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures, are effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with some signi cant changes compared with IFRS 3.
For example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classi ed as debt subsequently remeasured through the statement of comprehensive income.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All acquisition-related costs are expensed.
IFRS 3 revised has had no impact on the Group, as the Group is organically grown and does not follow a strategy of acquisitions.
IFRS 5 amendment, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
The amendment clari caties that IFRS 5 speci es the disclosures required in respect of non-current assets or disposal groups classi ed as held for sale or discontinued operations.
It also clari es that the general requirements of IAS 1 still apply, in particular paragraph 15 to achieve a fair presentation and paragraph 125 sources of estimation uncertainty of IAS 1.
IFRIC 17, Distribution of non-cash assets to owners effective on or after 1 July 2009.
The interpretation was published in November 2008.
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends.
IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are classi ed as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present condition and the distribution is highly probable.
c New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010 and not early adopted.
The groups and parent entitys assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.
IAS 24 revised, Related party disclosures, issued in November 2009.
It supersedes IAS 24, Related party disclosures, issued in 2003.
IAS 24 revised is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted.
However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The revised standard clari es and simpli es the fide nition of a related party and removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government and other government-related entities.
The group will apply the revised standard from 1 January 2011.
When the revised standard is applied, the group and the parent will need to disclose any transactions between its subsidiaries and its associates.
The group is currently putting systems in place to capture the necessary information.
It is, therefore, not possible at this stage to disclose the impact, if any, of the revised standard on the related party disclosures.
Classi cation of rights issues amendment to IAS 32, issued in October 2009.
The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010.
The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer.
Provided certain conditions are met, such rights issues are now classi ed as equity regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated.
Previously, these issues had to be accounted for as derivative liabilities.
The amendment applies retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors.
The group will apply the amended standard from 1 January 2011.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED New standards and interpretations continued IFRS 9, Financial instruments, issued in November 2009.
This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets.
While the Group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact, it is unlikely to signi cantly affect the Groups accounting for financial assets.
The standard is not applicable until 1 January 2013, but is available for early adoption.
Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement amendments to IFRIC 14.
The amendments correct an unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The limit on a fide ned bene t asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
Without the amendments, entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments for minimum funding contributions.
This was not intended when IFRIC 14 was issued, and the amendments correct this.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011.
The amendments should be applied retrospectively to the earliest comparative period presented.
The group will apply these amendments for the financial reporting period commencing on 1 January 2011.
IFRIC 19, Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments, effective 1 July 2010.
The interpretation clari es the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability debt for equity swap.
It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in pro t or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
If the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the equity instruments should be measured to re ect the fair value of the financial liability extinguished.
The group will apply the interpretation from 1 January 2011, subject to endorsement by the EU.
It is not expected to have any impact on the group or the parent entitys financial statements.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the above Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have little or no impact on the financial statements of the Group when the relevant Standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011.
Going concern The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the Business Review on page 28. a Revenue and income recognition Revenue, which excludes value added tax VAT, constitutes the value of services undertaken by the Group from its principal activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary services.
These consist of: revenue from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff, including the salary cost of these staff.
This is recognised when the service has been provided: revenue from permanent placements is typically based on a percentage of the candidates remuneration package and is derived from both retained assignments income recognised on completion of fide ned stages of work and non-retained assignments income recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate and where a start date has been determined.
The latter includes revenue anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the balance sheet within prepayments and accrued income.
A provision is made against accrued income for possible cancellations of placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement of employment: and revenue from amounts billed to clients for expenses incurred on their behalf principally advertisements is recognised when the expense is incurred.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
b Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of the salary cost of temporary staff and costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.
c Gross pro t Gross pro t represents revenue less cost of sales and consists of the total placement fees of permanent candidates, the margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates and the margin on advertising income.
d Foreign currency translation i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
66 Michael Page International FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED New standards and interpretations continued ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
iii Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperin ationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
e Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identi able assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised, but is tested at least annually for impairment see accounting policy h. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
ii Computer software Computer software acquired by the Group is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below.
Included with computer software, are assets under construction which are amortised from the point they go live.
iii Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are inde nite.
Goodwill has an inde nite useful life.
Computer software is amortised at 20% per annum.
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 is 311.7m 2009: 311.7m.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life at the following rates: Leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of lease if shorter Furniture, xtures and equipment 10-20% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum g Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
h Impairment of assets Assets that have an inde nite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identi able cash ows cash-generating units.
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events has had a negative effect on the estimated future cash ows of that asset.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED i Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro t for the year.
Taxable pro t differs from pro t as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable pro t nor the accounting pro t. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
j Pension costs The Group operates fide ned contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension costs charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.
k Leased assets Leases are classi ed as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classi ed as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to the income statement.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Bene ts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l Segment reporting IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identi ed on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Information provided to the Chief Executive is focused on regions and as a result, reportable segments are on a regional basis.
m Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
68 Michael Page International FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED n Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
Their accounting treatments are described below: i Share option schemes The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, earnings per share.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable is revised.
The Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and the corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
ii Deferred Annual Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plans Where deferred awards are made to Directors and senior executives under either the Incentive Share Plan or the Annual Bonus Scheme, to re ect that the awards are for services over a longer period, the value of the expected award is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period to which the award relates.
o Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
p Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an out ow of economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
q Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are accrued in the income statement on a time basis.
r Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classi ed as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash-in-hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ows.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
The Group has derivative contracts at the balance sheet date that have been valued at fair value through the income statement.
s Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management anticipate that any estimates and judgements made do not have a material effect on the results.
In particular, information about signi cant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signi cant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes: Michael Page International 69 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED s Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Note 1 revenue recognition In making its judgement, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from permanent placements where a position has been accepted by a candidate, a start date agreed, but employment has not yet commenced.
A provision is made by management, based on past historical experience, for the proportion of those placements where the candidate is expected to reverse their acceptance prior to the start date.
Note 14 trade and other receivables There is uncertainty regarding customers who may not be able to pay as their invoices fall due.
In reviewing the appropriateness of the provisions in respect of recoverability of trade receivables, consideration has been given to the economic climate in the respective markets, the ageing of the debt and the potential likelihood of default.
Note 17 deferred tax Management has estimated the likely value of deferred tax assets in respect of trading losses carried forward.
Note 18 share-based payments The Groups policy for share-based payments is stated in note 1 n. The fair value of equity settled share-based payments is partly derived from estimates of factors such as lapse rates and achievement of performance criteria.
It is also derived from assumptions such as the future volatility of the Companys share price, expected dividend yields and risk-free interest rates.
t Non-recurring items Non-recurring items are those items the Group considers to be one-off or material in nature that should be brought to the readers attention in understanding the Groups financial performance.
SEGMENT REPORTING All revenues disclosed are derived from external customers.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies described in note 1.
Segment operating pro t represents the pro t earned by each segment without allocation of central administration costs and certain recharges.
This is the measure reported to the Groups Chief Executive for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Non-recurring items NRI relate wholly to the United Kingdom.
The analysis below is of the carrying amount of reportable segment assets, liabilities and non-current assets.
Segment assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The individual reportable segments exclude income tax assets and liabilities.
Non-current assets include property, plant and equipment, computer software and goodwill.

72 Michael Page International FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5.
NON-RECURRING ITEMS NRI VAT In 2003, the Group submitted an initial claim to Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC for overpaid VAT which was rejected.
The Group appealed and subsequently led amended claims for 26.5m, net of fees, covering the period from 1980 to 2004.
In March 2009, the Group led amended claims for a further refund of an additional 80m, net of fees, of overpaid VAT covering the same period.
In June 2009 the Group received a payment from HMRC of 26.5m, net of fees, as part settlement of these claims and in July 2009 received 10.5m, net of fees, of statutory interest.
As a result, the principal and interest amounts were recognised in the half year to June 2009 results, with the interest receivable being recorded within working capital in the cash ow statement.
On 25 September 2009, the Group received a letter from HMRC which stated that, HMRC have reviewed the recent payment and are now of the view that the claim in whole or in part should not have been paid.
A number of discussions and meetings with HMRC followed and on 5 March 2010, the Group announced that an agreement had been reached in principle, subject to legal contract, for the Group to retain 28.4m net of fees.
However, given the background to the initial receipt, the subsequent review and reversal of HMRCs position, together with the remaining uncertainty pending formal contractual agreement, the Group reversed out the amounts originally recognised in the 2009 half year results and as such did not recognise any amount in the Income Statement in the 2009 full year.
On 30 April 2010, a formal agreement was signed with HMRC.
As a result, of the 50m originally received from HMRC, the Group retained 38.1m and returned 11.9m in May 2010.
Accordingly, after fees, the Group has recognised 28.4m as non-recurring income in its 2010 Income Statement, of which 17.1m is in respect of refunded VAT and is included in operating pro t and 11.3m is in respect of interest and is included in financial income.
In respect of the amended claims for a further refund of an additional 80m, net of fees, of overpaid VAT, the Group is continuing to pursue the claim.
Taxation of 8.0m on non-recurring items, net of expenses, has been provided representing an effective tax rate of 28.0%.
A summary of the effects of the non-recurring item NRI is shown in the tables below: Underlying NRI Total 2010 2010 2010 Effect on pro t after tax 000 000 000 Operating pro t 71,527 17,125 88,652 Net interest 669 11,335 12,004 Pro t before tax 72,196 28,460 100,656 Taxation 25,203 7,969 33,172 Pro t after tax 46,993 20,491 67,484 There is no effect on pro t after tax in the prior year.

DIVIDENDS 2010 2009 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 5.12p per ordinary share 2008: 5.12p 16,066 16,487 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 2.88p per ordinary share 2009: 2.88p 8,813 9,366 24,879 25,853 Amounts proposed as distributions to equity holders: Proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 6.12p per ordinary share 2009: 5.12p 18,755 16,535 The proposed final dividend had not been approved by shareholders at 31 December 2010 and therefore has not been included as a liability.
The comparative final dividend at 31 December 2009 was also not recognised as a liability in the prior year.
The proposed final dividend of 6.12p 2009: 5.12p per ordinary share will be paid on 6 June 2011 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 6 May 2011, subject to approval by shareholders.
When the Company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
The impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.
EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2010 2009 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share 000 67,484 12,430 Non-recurring items NRI 000 note 5 20,491 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share before NRI 000 46,993 12,430 Number of shares 311,821 Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share 000 321,643 Dilution effect of share plans 000 7,653 7,412 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 319,474 329,055 Basic earnings per share pence 21.6 3.9 Diluted earnings per share pence 21.1 3.8 15.1 Basic earnings per share before NRI pence 3.9 Diluted earnings per share before NRI pence 14.7 3.8 The above results relate to continuing operations.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the pro t attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Employee Bene t Trust and held in the reserve.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to re ect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.
Potential future ordinary share transactions It remains the Companys intention to use surplus cash to repurchase and cancel its shares.
A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are calculated by preparing cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget, management projections for five years, followed by an assumed growth rate of 3%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the relevant markets and re ects long-term wage in ation fee growth.
Management applied a discount rate of 10% to the estimated future cash ows to calculate the terminal value of those cash ows.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is the opinion of the Directors that at 31 December 2010 there was no impairment of intangible assets.

DEFERRED TAX The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group, and the movements thereon, during the current and prior reporting periods.
Share-based payments Tax losses Other Total 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 2009 1,415 2,646 1,538 5,599 Recognised in equity for the year 2,283 2,283 Recognised in pro t or loss for the year 740 331 899 1,970 Exchange differences At 1 January 2010 4,438 2,977 2,437 9,852 Recognised in equity for the year 3,698 3,698 Recognised in pro t or loss for the year 1,184 2,060 2,367 877 Exchange differences 596 596 At 31 December 2010 6,952 917 4,208 12,077 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2010 2009 000 000 Deferred tax assets 12,441 10,179 Deferred tax liabilities 364 327 12,077 9,852 At 31 December 2010, unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies amounted to 60.9m 2009: 52.2m.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas tax, but should not be liable to UK tax if they were to be distributed as dividends.
Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 8.2m 2009: 5.5m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable pro ts in the respective jurisdictions.
All of the deferred tax asset for losses of 0.9m is dependent on generating future taxable pro ts.
Of the recognised deferred tax asset, 0.3m is recognised within territories that were loss making in the current year.
CALLED-UP SHARE CAPITAL 2010 2009 Number of Number of 000 shares 000 shares Authorised Ordinary shares of 1p each 5,713 571,250,000 5,713 571,250,000 Allotted, called-up and fully paid At 1 January 3,234 323,424,875 3,220 321,990,067 Shares issued 19 1,874,930 14 1,434,808 Cancellation of own shares 37 3,709,658 At 31 December 3,216 321,590,147 3,234 323,424,875 Share Option Plans The Group currently has share option awards outstanding under an Executive share option scheme ESOS and a share option scheme SOS.
These plans are described below.
At 31 December 2010 the following options had been granted and remained outstanding in respect of the Companys ordinary shares of 1p under both the Michael Page Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share Option Scheme.
All options granted are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 4.55.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Using the ESOS, awards of share options can be made to key management personnel and senior employees to receive shares in the entity.
Share options are exercisable at the market price of the shares at the date of the grant.
Two grants under the ESOS were made before 7 November 2002.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002.
They have not been applied to the two grants made prior to 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
No awards were made under the ESOS scheme in 2009.
80 Michael Page International FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 18.
CALLED-UP SHARE CAPITAL CONTINUED ESOS plan details Note 1 Pre otation options On otation, options over 33,750,000 9% ordinary shares were granted to the Executive Directors and 427 employees.
An individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that share price growth targets have been satis ed over a period of at least 3 years.
None of these options will vest unless the Companys share price has achieved 50% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
At that point one third of this portion of the options vest.
Vesting then increases progressively for further share price growth until full vesting occurs where there is 200% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
These hurdles rise from the fifth anniversary of the date of grant at compound rates of growth of 8.45% and 24.57% respectively.
At 31 December 2010, the performance conditions were met for 81.8% 2009: 81.8% of the outstanding share price dependent options.
At 31 December 2010, 18.2% of the options remained unvested 2009: 18.2%.
In order for these remaining options to have vested by 31 December 2010 a share price of 12.57 2009: 10.96 would have been required.
At this stage it is not expected that the remaining 18.2% of options will vest prior to the awards lapsing on 31 March 2011.
Note 2 Grants post otation For grants since 2004, the performance condition is tested on the third anniversary and no retesting will occur thereafter.
These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index.
The respective base earnings per share for each grant are shown in the table on page 80.
For the 2010 share option grant for Executive Directors only, the vesting of awards will be subject to pro t before tax performance conditions measured over a three year period.
Vesting will occur on a phased basis, with 30% of the award vesting for threshold performance, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the award for maximum performance.
Share Option Scheme SOS Note 3 Executive Directors of the Company are not eligible to participate in this scheme.
Any exercises of awards made under this plan must be settled by market purchased shares.
This new scheme was created in 2009 to provide an effective plan under which to grant awards in 2009.
It was the Boards view that grants made under the existing ESOS plan, which would have required an increase over the 2008 base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index by 2011, would be achievable due to the impact of the global downturn on the Groups EPS and thus would not provide the required retention incentive.
The 2009 grant made under the SOS plan is subject to a performance condition that will be tested, initially, three years after the date of grant and then annually until either the entire grant has vested, or ten years from the date of the award have elapsed, in which case any awards outstanding under the grant will lapse.
The performance condition is directly linked to the Groups Operating Pro t. If Operating Pro t is 30m then 30% of the award would vest.
For every 1m of Operating Pro t over 30m, a further 1% would vest.
100% of the award would vest if Operating Pro t was 100m.
Share Option valuation and measurement In 2010, options were granted on 9 March with the estimated fair values of the options granted on that day of 1.17.
In 2009, options were granted on 9 March.
The estimated fair values of the options granted on that date was 0.76.
Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions.
These conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants other than those on the initial grant in 2001.
CALLED-UP SHARE CAPITAL Share Option valuation and measurement The options outstanding at 31 December 2010 have an exercise price in the range of 81.5 pence to 494.1 pence and a weighted average contractual life of 7.8 years.
The fair values of options granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: Share Option Plans Incentive Share Scheme Deferred Bonus Shares 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 3.82 Share price 1.88 1.88 1.88 Average exercise price 3.82 1.91 Nil Nil Weighted average fair value 1.17 0.76 1.88 1.88 Expected volatility 38% 63% 63% 63% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 2 years Risk free rate 2.99% 2.19% 2.04% 1.46% Expected dividend yield 2.10% 4.27% Nil Nil Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Companys share price since otation.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Group recognised total expenses of 10.0m 2009: 8.5m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Other share-based payment plans The Company also operates an Incentive Share Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and an Annual Bonus Plan for the Executive Directors.
Details of these schemes are disclosed on pages 50 and 51, and are settled by the physical delivery of shares, currently satis ed by shares held in the Employee Bene t Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
RESERVES Share premium The share premium account has been established to represent the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.
Capital redemption reserve The movement in the capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Companys own shares.
Reserve for shares held in the employee bene t trust At 31 December 2010, the reserve for shares held in the employee bene t trust consisted of 18,955,701 ordinary shares 2009: 5,925,597 ordinary shares held for the purpose of satisfying awards made under the Incentive Share Plan, the Annual Bonus Plan and the Share Option Scheme SOS, representing 5.9% of the called-up share capital with a market value of 105.2m 2009: 22.5m.
A total of 6,941,429 shares have been allocated to satisfy share awards made under the Incentive Share Plan, 370,643 deferred shares have been allocated to the Annual Bonus Plan and 6,307,500 shares have been allocated to satisfy share options.
Dividends are paid on 4,778,489 of these shares and they are included in the EPS calculation.
Following the allocation of awards made under the above mentioned plans, to date 5,336,129 ordinary shares remain unallocated in the reserve and there are 14,177,212 shares that are treated as non-dilutive and on which dividends are waived.
Currency translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations that are integral to the operations of the Company.

The structure facilitates interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: i credit risk ii liquidity risk iii market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to re ect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from clients and investment securities.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no signi cant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Trade and other receivables Total trade receivables net of allowances held by the Group at 31 December 2010 amounted to 134.7m 2009: 100.2m.
An initial credit period is made available on invoices.
No interest is charged on trade receivables from the date of the invoice during this credit period.
Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balance.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 150 days because historical experience is such that receivables past due beyond 150 days are generally not recoverable.
Trade receivables below 150 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the provision of our services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 54.0m 2009: 37.4m that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 41 days in excess of the initial credit period 2009: 40 days.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross trade Gross trade receivables Provision receivables Provision 2010 2010 2009 2009 000 000 000 000 Not past due 81,685 982 62,942 167 Past due 0-30 days 38,755 162 27,880 85 Past due 31-150 days 16,145 718 11,466 1,839 More than 150 days 4,535 4,535 4,868 4,868 141,120 6,397 107,156 6,959 The Groups exposure to credit risk is in uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each client.
The demographics of the Groups client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an in uence on credit risk.
Less than 3% of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single client.
The geographic diversi cation of the Groups revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.
The majority of the Groups clients have been transacting with the Group for several years, with losses rarely occurring.
In monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry, ageing pro le, maturity and existence of previous financial dif culties.

The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED i Credit risk continued Exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 000 000 EMEA 68,043 55,783 United Kingdom 40,142 28,705 Asia Paci c 15,098 9,384 Americas 11,440 6,325 134,723 100,197 The maximum exposure to credit risk for accrued income at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2010 2009 000 000 EMEA 1,079 586 United Kingdom 8,713 5,830 Asia Paci c 5,983 3,577 Americas 3,026 1,183 18,801 11,176 The entire accrued income balance is not past due.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above and in note 14.
ii Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework that aims to ensure that the Group has suf cient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast liabilities as they fall due.
It is the Directors intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from retained earnings.
Cash surpluses are invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities.
Cash generated in excess of these requirements will be used to buy back the Companys shares.
The Group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.
Carrying amount Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2010 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 5,625 3,010 456 Accruals and other payables 37,597 24,885 25,386 4,156 Bank overdraft Carrying amount Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2009 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 5,360 1,728 216 Accruals and other payables 26,849 71,327 13,425 2,881 Bank overdraft 43 Michael Page International 85 22.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED iii Market risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but these risks are not deemed to be material.
However, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical uctuations in Pounds Sterling against the Groups main exposure currencies is shown on page 87.
There has been no material change in the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
For additional information on market risk, refer to Treasury management and currency risk in the Business Review.
Interest rate risk management Borrowings are arranged at oating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The Group does not consider this risk as signi cant.
The benchmark rates for determining oating rate liabilities are based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
The average interest rate paid on bank overdrafts was 1.82% 2009: 2.4%.
Currency rate risk We publish our results in Pounds Sterling and conduct our business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of our subsidiaries and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of our foreign subsidiaries.
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar.
The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures, nor is there a material exposure to foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations although our policy is not to hedge this exposure.
In certain cases, where the Group gives or receives short-term loans to and from other Group companies with different reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange swap derivative financial instruments to manage the currency and interest rate exposure that arises on these loans.
It is the Groups policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges.
All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classi ed as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below.
Contract amounts Derivatives at fair value 2010 2009 2010 2009 Derivatives Financial Instruments m m m m Derivative Assets 30.8 10.0 31.1 10.0 Derivative Liabilities 30.8 10.0 30.9 10.1 Sensitivity analysis - currency risk A 10 percent strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased equity and pro t or loss by the amounts shown on page 87.
This analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i. e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation, and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2009.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected, due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause uctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
