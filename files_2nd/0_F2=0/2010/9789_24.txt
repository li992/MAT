86 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2010 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Segmental information The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 29 March 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reporting about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and rewards approach, with the Groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the executive directors.
The executive directors review the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The operating segments are UK and International which are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the executive directors.
The UK segment consists of the UK retail business and UK franchise operations.
The International segment consists of Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Europe and Asia, together with international franchise operations.
The executive directors assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of exceptional items from the operating segments as well as gains or losses on the disposal of assets.
Central costs are all classified as UK costs and presented within UK operating profit.
The executive directors also monitor revenue within the segments.
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segments.
The following is an analysis of the Groups revenue and results by reportable segment: 53 weeks ended 3 April 2010 52 weeks ended 28 March 2009 2 2 Management Adjustment Statutory Management Adjustment Statutory m m m m m m General Merchandise 4,186.2 34.2 4,152.0 3,944.4 26.1 3,918.3 Food 4,455.5 39.6 4,415.9 4,282.3 36.3 4,246.0 UK revenue 8,641.7 73.8 8,567.9 8,226.7 62.4 8,164.3 Wholesale 297.7 297.7 272.3 272.3 Retail 673.1 2.1 671.0 627.2 1.7 625.5 International revenue 970.8 2.1 968.7 899.5 1.7 897.8 Group revenue 9,612.5 75.9 9,536.6 9,126.2 64.1 9,062.1 1 UK operating profit 701.2 701.2 652.8 652.8 International operating profit 142.7 142.7 116.1 116.1 Group operating profit adjusted 843.9 843.9 768.9 768.9 Profit on property disposals 8.1 6.4 Exceptional costs 135.9 Exceptional pension credit 231.3 Group operating profit 852.0 870.7 Finance income 12.9 50.0 Finance costs 162.2 214.5 Profit before tax 702.7 706.2 1 UK operating profit includes a contribution of 30.4m last year 24.8m in respect of fees received from HSBC in relation to M&S Money.

The exceptional pension credit in 2008 09 arose due to changes in the UK Defined Benefit Pension Scheme relating to how members benefits build up.
In January 2009 the Group announced that it had made changes to the scheme by capping employees annual increases in pensionable pay to 1% and changing the early retirement benefits for members who joined the scheme before 1996.
There was a credit to the income statement to reflect the impact of adjusting employees projected final pensionable salaries.
There are no exceptional costs arising in the current year.

8 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The adjusted earnings per share figures have also been calculated based on earnings excluding the effect of property disposals and exceptional items.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

11 Retirement benefits The Group provides pension arrangements for the benefit of its UK employees through the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme.
This has a defined benefit section, which was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2002, and a defined contribution section which has been open to new members with effect from 1 April 2003.
The defined benefit section operates on a final salary basis and at the year end had some 15,000 active members last year 21,000, 56,000 deferred members last year 57,000 and 47,000 pensioners last year 42,000.
At the year end, the defined contribution section had some 8,000 active members last year 8,000 and some 1,000 deferred members last year 1,000.
The Group also operates a small funded defined benefit pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland.
Retirement benefits also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement benefits.
Within the total Group retirement benefit cost, excluding the exceptional pension credit, of 46.5m last year 31.8m, 27.0 last year 14.0m relates to the UK defined benefit section, 12.3m last year 13.0m to the UK defined contribution section and 7.2m last year 4.8m to other retirement benefit schemes.

Financial assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the UK Defined Benefit Pension Scheme was carried out at 31 March 2009 and showed a deficit of 1.3bn.
A funding plan of 800m has been agreed with the Trustees see note 31.
The difference between the valuation and the funding plan is expected to be met by investment returns on the existing assets of the pension scheme.
The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Retirement Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes: 2010 2009 % % Rate of increase in salaries 1.0 1.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service pre-April 1997 2.7 2.6 between April 1997 and July 2005 3.5 2.9 post-July 2005 2.3 2.3 Discount rate 5.5 6.8 Inflation rate 3.6 2.9 Long-term healthcare cost increases 8.6 7.9 The amount of the deficit varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 deficit would decrease increase by c. 90m.
C. Demographic assumptions The demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme 31 March 2009.
One of the most significant demographic assumptions underlying the valuation is mortality.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the scheme for the period to March 2009 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent years.
The specific mortality rates used are based on the SAPS tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2010 2009 years years Current pensioners at age 65 males 21.9 21.2 females 23.3 23.6 Future pensioners at age 65 males 23.1 22.0 females 24.2 24.3 D.

The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward-looking views of financial markets as suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
Consideration is also given to the rate of return expected to be available for reinvestment.
At year end, the UK scheme indirectly held 232,042 last year 369,793 ordinary shares in the Company through its investment in an Aquila Life UK Equity Index Fund.

2 In 2007 08 the Group agreed to pre-fund 200.0m of its annual contribution to the UK Defined Benefit Pension Scheme for the next three years.
The prepayment is in respect of annual contributions to the UK scheme at the rate of 23.2% of pensionable salaries up to 30 September 2010 and then 22.9% up to the next financial year.
It is estimated that approximately 55.0m of the prepayment will relate to the year ended 2 April 2011.

Further details of the option and share schemes that the Group operates are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 58 to 71.
Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
HMRC rules limit the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the scheme.

The fair values of the options granted during the year have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown below: 2010 2009 3-year plan 3-year plan 5-year plan Grant date Nov 09 Nov 08 Nov 08 Share price at grant date 365p 253p 253p Exercise price 292p 203p 203p Option life in years 3 years 3 years 5 years Risk-free rate 1.6% 2.9% 3.2% Expected volatility 44.1% 39.2% 33.4% Expected dividend yield 4.1% 8.9% 8.9% Fair value of option 113p 54.6p 43.9p Volatility has been estimated by taking the historic volatility in the Companys share price over a three or five year period.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three or five years on the assumption that 20% of options will lapse over the service period as employees leave the Group.
Executive Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme, last approved by shareholders in 2005, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to executive directors and senior managers at the market price on a date to be determined prior to the date of the offer.
No further options may be granted under any schemes other than the 2005 scheme.
No awards have been made under the 2005 scheme.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 64.
Performance targets are assessed over a three year period from the date of grant with no ability to retest any grants.
Once options have vested they can be exercised during the period up to 10 years from grant date.

Under the plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be offered.
The extent to which the awards vest is based on adjusted earnings per share growth over three years.
The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the three years will also be paid on vesting.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 63.
Awards under this scheme have been made in each year since 2005.

E. Restricted Share Plan The Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention and recruitment of senior managers who are vital to the success of the business.
The plan operates for senior managers below executive director level.
Awards under the plan are made as part of ongoing reviews of reward packages, and for recruitment.
The shares are held in trust for a period of between one and three years, at which point they are released to the employee, subject to them still being in employment.
The value of any dividends earned during the restricted period will also be paid at the time of vesting.
During the year, 342,600 shares last year 1,755,667 have been awarded under the plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded was 348.6p last year 337.8p.

G. Share Matching Deal Plan The Share Matching Deal Plan was introduced in 2006 for those employees who were eligible to receive a cash-only bonus.
The scheme was not open to those employees who participated in the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The plan allows employees to invest a proportion of their bonus in shares of the Company.
These investment shares must be held by the participant for three years, during which time they will receive dividends.
At the end of the three year holding period, if the participant is still in employment with the Company, and still holds the investment shares, they will receive one matching share for every four that they bought.
No shares were awarded under the Share Matching Deal Plan during the year.
As at 3 April 2010, 22,000 shares last year 53,000 were outstanding under the scheme.
H. Republic of Ireland Save As You Earn Scheme Sharesave, the Companys Save As You Earn Scheme was introduced in 2009 to all employees in the Republic of Ireland for a 10 year period, after approval by shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
The scheme is subject to Irish Revenue rules which limit the maximum monthly saving to 500 per month.
The Company chose in 2009 to set a monthly savings cap of 320 per month to align the maximum savings amount allowed within the UK scheme.
When the savings contract is started, options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total savings will buy when the contract matures, at a discounted price set at the start of the scheme.
The price at which the options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive days preceding the offer date.
Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
During the year, 287,235 options were granted, at a fair value of 113.1p.

The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and changes in income and costs.
The Group prepares discounted cash flow forecasts based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a three year period, which takes account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
Cash flows beyond this three year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the Groups retail businesses.
The Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital is used to discount the future cash flows.
A risk adjustment is then made for the countries in which the business unit operates: per una discount rate 8.6% last year 10.2% : Marks and Spencer Marinopoulos B. V. 12.9% last year 12.2%, Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. 10.2% last year 13.2% and Supreme Tradelinks Private Limited 12.6%.
Based on the discounted cash flows the valuations indicate sufficient headroom that any reasonably possible change in the assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment.
Brands consist of the per una brand which is being amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.
Additions to property, plant and equipment during the year amounting to 0.1m last year 32.8m were financed by new finance leases.

All such valuers are chartered surveyors, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
The properties were valued on the basis of market value calculated based on subleases in place at the year end.
All valuations were carried out in accordance with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards.
As the investment properties are held at depreciated historical cost, this valuation has not been reflected in the carrying value of the assets.
No impairment was recognised on the one property which was carried at a higher value than its market value at 28 March 2009.
The Group has reoccupied the property during 2009 10 and has subsequently been reclassified to property, plant and equipment at which point its value in use exceeded the net book value.
The Group received rental income of 0.9m last year 1.2m in respect of these investment properties.

5 These notes include an investor put and issuer call option exercisable in December 2012.
On 25 November the Group announced the successful tender offer for 67.4m of the November 2011 medium-term notes and 132.6m of the May 2012 medium-term notes incurring a one-off premium of 13.5m on the buy-back.
In conjunction, new medium-term notes were issued totalling 400m at a coupon rate of 6.125%, of which 200m have been swapped to floating rate and designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
Finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as shown in the table on the following page.
It is the Groups policy to lease certain of its properties and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term for equipment is 6 years and 125 years for property.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
22 Financial instruments Treasury policy and financial risk management The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
Group treasury also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and financing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: To find out more, visit www.
com annualreport2010 103 Directors report p01 Financial statements Other information p117 22 Financial instruments continued a Liquidity funding risk The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due at a reasonable price.
The Groups funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are financed by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 1.2bn set to mature on 26 March 2013.
This facility contains only one financial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rents payable: to interest plus rents payable.
The covenant is measured semi-annually.
The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At year end, these amounted to 105m last year 105m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of 220m last year 764m was drawn under the committed facilities and nil last year nil was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a euro medium-term note programme of 3bn, of which 1.6bn last year 1.4bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
The present value of finance lease liabilities is as follows: 2010 2009 m m Within one year 13.7 13.7 Later than one year and not later than five years 26.7 36.5 Later than five years 49.4 51.7 Total 89.8 101.9 b Counterparty risk Counterparty risk exists where the Group can suffer financial loss through default or non-performance by financial institutions.
Exposures are managed through Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The counterparties are limited to the approved institutions with secure long-term credit ratings A A1 or better assigned by Moodys and Standard & Poors respectively, unless approved on an exception basis by a Board director.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
The credit risk of these financial instruments is estimated as the fair value of the assets resulting from the contracts.

2 Excludes derivative asset option which is embedded within the 250m puttable callable reset medium-term notes due 2037.
3 Exposure to a counterparty approved as an exception to treasury policy.
4 Standard & Poors equivalent rating shown as reference to the lowest credit rating of the counterparty from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 89m last year 84m, other receivables 62m last year 64m, cash and cash equivalents 406m last year 423m and derivatives 181m last year 347m.
c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group treasury hedge these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
Where appropriate hedge cover can be taken out longer than 18 months, with Board approval.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to sterling against movements in US dollar and euro.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the Groups forecast currency requirements are designated as cash flow hedges with fair value movements recognised directly in comprehensive income.
To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables, then associated fair value movements previously recognised in comprehensive income are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 865m last year 768m with a weighted average maturity date of five months last year six months.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 3 April 2010 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 13 months last year 14 months from the balance sheet date.
At the balance sheet date the Group did not hold any derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures.
However, the translation exposures arising on the overseas net assets are hedged with foreign currency debt.
As at the balance sheet date, 231m last year 276m and HK$180m last year HK$178m currency debt was hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 155m last year 108m.
After taking into account the hedging derivatives entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities is as set out below excluding short-term payables and the Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. put option: 2010 2009 Fixed Floating Fixed Floating rate rate Total rate rate Total m m m m m m Currency Sterling 2,136.4 410.0 2,546.4 2,252.4 629.9 2,882.3 Euro 8.6 232.8 241.4 7.6 286.1 293.7 Hong Kong dollar 15.2 15.2 16.4 16.4 Other 3.3 26.5 29.8 0.3 7.9 8.2 2,148.3 684.5 2,832.8 2,260.3 940.3 3,200.6 To find out more, visit www.
com annualreport2010 105 Directors report p01 Financial statements Other information p117 22 Financial instruments continued The floating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
These rates are for periods between one and three months.
As at the balance sheet date and excluding finance leases, the fixed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 5.9% last year 6.0% and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is ten years last year nine years.
d Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the sterling, US dollar, euro and Hong Kong dollar variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date fixed rate borrowings amounted to 2,148.3m last year 2,260.3m representing the public bond issues and finance leases, amounting to 76% last year 71% of the Groups gross borrowings.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2010 2009 % % Committed and uncommitted borrowings 0.6 4.0 Medium-term notes 5.9 6.2 Finance leases 4.7 4.8 Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme 5.7 Derivative financial instruments 2010 2009 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Current Options held for trading 14.3 14.3 27.0 27.0 Commodity swap cash flow hedge 2.1 16.7 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash flow hedges 30.1 5.0 59.9 27.4 held for trading 3.7 1.4 5.7 0.4 Interest rate swaps held for trading 4.3 4.7 48.1 27.1 92.6 76.2 Non-current Commodity swap cash flow hedge 1.5 Cross currency swaps cash flow hedges 132.8 253.9 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash flow hedges 0.1 0.1 1.5 132.9 254.0 3.0 At the balance sheet date, the Group held a number of cross currency swaps to redesignate its fixed rate US dollar debt to fixed rate sterling debt.
The attributes of these derivatives match the characteristics of the underlying debt hedged with rates of 7.034% 2017 bond and 7.238% 2037 bond.
The amounts reported as options held for trading in derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of the call option with the puttable callable reset notes, mirrored by the fair value of the sold option to have this call assigned.
During the year the Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps to redesignate sterling fixed debt to floating debt.
These swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges.
The ineffective portion recognised in the profit or loss that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a loss of 0.4m last year nil as the gain on the hedged item was 1.5m last year nil and the loss on the hedging instrument was 1.9m last year nil.
There was no ineffectiveness on cash flow hedging or net investment hedging.
106 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2010 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all of the Groups financial instruments.
The Group considers that a 2% - movement in interest rates and a 20% weakening or strengthening in sterling represents reasonable possible changes.
However, this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reflects the effect on the Groups floating rate debt as at the balance sheet date.
The impact in equity reflects the fair value movement in relation to the Groups cross currency swaps.
The impact in the income statement from foreign exchange movements reflects the change in the fair value of the Groups transactional foreign exchange cash flow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign exchange risk is hedged.

Unlisted equity investments are included in Level 3.
The fair value of the embedded derivative is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on financial forecasts.

Fair value of financial instruments With the exception of the Groups fixed rate bond debt, there were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups fixed rate bond debt was 2,183.9m last year 2,018.5m : the fair value of this debt was 2,107.7m last year 1,616.6m.
Capital policy The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimal returns for shareholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In doing so the Groups strategy is to maintain a capital structure commensurate with an investment grade credit rating and to retain appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure financial stability and flexibility.
To achieve this strategy the Group regularly monitors key credit metrics such as the gearing ratio, cash flow to net debt see note 29 and fixed charge cover to maintain this position.
In addition the Group ensures a combination of appropriate committed short-term liquidity headroom with a diverse and smooth long-term debt maturity profile.
During the year the Group maintained an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 stable with Moodys and BBBstable with Standard & Poor s, and through the successful tender of 200m of existing short-dated bonds in conjunction with a new 400m 10 year bond issue extended the average fixed debt maturity by one year to ten years and increased short-term liquidity by 200m.
In order to maintain or re-align the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable to them in the foreseeable future.
Undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries amount to 396.5m last year 380.6m.
The Group is claiming UK tax relief for losses incurred by some of its current and former European subsidiaries.
In light of continuing litigation, no asset has been recognised in respect of these claims.

The aggregate consideration paid was 40.9m.
Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership In previous years, a partnership liability was recorded relating to an amortising liability in respect of obligations of the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership to the Marks and Spencer UK Pension Scheme.
On 25 March 2009 the terms of the Scottish Limited Partnership agreement were amended to make the payment of annual distributions to the Pension Scheme discretionary from 2010 11 onwards.
This discretion is exercisable if the Group does not pay a dividend or make any other form of return to its shareholders.
As a result, the distribution to the Pension Scheme in 2009 and 2010 remained as a financial liability, while the remaining financial instrument became an equity interest.
The fair value of the equity interest on the date of transfer was 571.7m.
This amount has been reclassified to other reserves in the year to better reflect the substance of the Groups interest.
Under the amended agreement the value of total discretionary scheduled payments is approximately 862m.
The Groups policy to grow dividends in line with adjusted earnings per share is explained in the Financial review on page 43.
The agreement includes a clause such that, following a default event including the appointment of an administrator, liquidator, receiver or similar officer in respect of Marks and Spencer plc or Marks and Spencer Group plc or on a relevant change of law, the net present value of the outstanding distributions becomes payable to the Pension Scheme by the Scottish Limited Partnership at the option of the Pension Scheme.
On the basis of the expected cash flows associated with such an event, the related financial liability has been fair valued at nil.

The acquisition has contributed 8.3m to sales and a 0.2m loss to operating profit in the period since acquisition, which is the same contribution had the acquisition taken place on the first day of the financial period.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition due to the opportunities to facilitate a faster rate of growth and greater operating efficiency that do not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
