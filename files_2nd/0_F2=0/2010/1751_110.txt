The information for Kevin Thomas is as regards the position at 1 May 2010, the date on which he took office as a Director.
These options vested according to comparative TSR performance over a three-year performance period.
They were not subject to re-testing.
The comparator group was the companies in the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector when the options were granted which was the sector in which the Companys shares were then listed.
There was no vesting unless the Company ranked above median performance, in which case 25% of the options vested.
Full vesting was for top quartile ranking with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for a ranking between those points.
The exercise price was set at the average of the mid-market closing price of the Companys shares for the three business days preceding the date of the grant.
This price was not discounted.
The options must be exercised before the tenth anniversary of the grant date, or earlier if there is a change of control, the Director leaves or dies, failing which they will lapse.
There were no changes in the above stated option position between 31 March 2010 and 10 May 2010.

Exercise details in the table below.
For Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas, the information given is as at and from 1 May 2010 when they took office as Directors.
The 2006 and 2007 L-TIP awards became fully vested and exercisable on 28 May 2009 and 26 March 2010 respectively having met the TSR and EPS performance criteria required see below.
The vesting date of L-TIP awards depends on the date of notification of the vesting.
Following the change to the rules approved by the Committee as described on page 68 above, this can be, at the option of the Remuneration Committee, either in the final month of the performance period or after the announcement of results for the final year of the performance period.
The above table assumes unless stated otherwise that the announcement is normally made in May and notification of vesting given in the same month.
The Committee exercised the discretion to allow vesting and exercise of the 2007 LTIP in March 2010 as explained on page 68.
However 50% of the shares obtained by Peter Rogers and Bill Tame on exercise are subject to restrictions on disposal until 11 June 2010 as also described on page 68.
The performance criteria attached to those of the above awards that have vested namely those made in 2006 and 2007 were that half of the shares vested based on comparative TSR performance and half according to growth in earnings per share EPS.
For the TSR element, a ranking in the upper quartile which was achieved resulted in 100% vesting.
The TSR calculation used a 12-month average for share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the period.
The comparator group of listed companies for the 2006 award comprised AEA Technology, W. S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Laing John, Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group and WSP Group.
The comparator group for the awards made in 2007 comprised AEA Technology, W. S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, WSP Group, Weir Group, Ashtead Group, Alfred McAlpine and Davis Service Group.
For the other half of the 2006 and 2007 awards, vesting depended on growth in EPS adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation over the performance period, with full vesting which was achieved where growth equalled or exceeded a real i. e. growth in excess of the increase in the consumer prices index compound annual growth rate of 8%.
The performance criteria attached to the unvested 2008 award are described further below on page 79.
