Directors also regularly participate in professional and industry seminars.
Performance Evaluation The Board The evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors is normally carried out annually by the Chairman of the Nomination Committee.
The process involves the Chairman speaking to each Director and the Chairmans review being conducted by an independent director.
These reviews are reported to the Nomination Committee.
In evaluating each Director they are assessed on their relevant experience, their strengths and weaknesses in relation to the overall requirements of the Board and their commitment to the Company in terms of time by regular attendance of Board meetings.
The process is constructed to assess the contribution of individual Directors to the overall operation of the Board and its committees.
In 2009 the Board commissioned a third party to undertake an independent review of the effectiveness of the Board.
This process involved Directors completing a condential questionnaire to elicit open and frank responses on areas that are critical to the proper functioning of the Board.
The results of the questionnaire were supplemented by telephone interviews held with each director.
The report and its conclusions were made available to the whole Board and discussed.
The Nomination Committee as part of the performance evaluation process considered the conclusions of the report and in line with the reports recommendations proposed that the role of Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Audit Committee be split and that post the continuation vote the Board should set in process a programme designed to replace gradually the longest serving Directors.

Polar Capital Technology Trust PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2010 20826 ARC Polar Back.
indd 44 17 06 2010 06:44 Directors Report Business Review and the Report on Corporate Governance 45 The Board has established a process for identifying, evaluating and managing any major risks faced by the Company.
The process is documented through the use of a Risk Map which is subject to regular review by the Board and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The controls are embedded within the business and aim to ensure that identied risks are managed and systems are in place to report on such risks.
The internal controls seek to ensure the assets of the Company are safeguarded, proper accounting records are maintained and the financial information used in the Group and for publication is reliable.
Controls covering the risks identied, including financial, operational, compliance and risk management are monitored by a series of regular reports covering investment performance, attribution analysis, reports from various third parties and from the investment manager including risks not directly the responsibility of the Investment Manager.
The process was active throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this annual report.
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate risks of failure to achieve the Companys business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has received formal reports from the Investment Manager with details of any known internal control failures.
The Board considers reports on the Investment Managers internal controls and systems operated by other third party suppliers.
The Board also receives and considers ad hoc reports from the Investment Manager and information is supplied to the Board as required.
The Board also examined the risks and controls operated by the Investment Manager when placing investment trades with third parties.
The Investment Manager has delegated the provision of accounting, portfolio valuation and trade processing to HSBC Securities Services UK Limited but remains responsible to the Company for these functions and provided the Board with information on these services.
The Board, assisted by the Investment Manager, undertakes an annual review of the Companys system of internal control where the Risk Map is reviewed and control processes considered.
The Board will continue to monitor the system of internal controls in order to provide assurance that they operate as intended.
The Board, assisted by the Investment Manager, has conducted an annual review of the risk map and the effectiveness of the system of internal controls taking into account any issues, none of which were considered significant, which arose during the course of the year ended 30 April 2010 and up to the date of this report.
Relations with shareholders The Board and the Investment Manager consider maintaining good communications with shareholders and engaging with larger shareholders through meetings and presentations a key priority.
