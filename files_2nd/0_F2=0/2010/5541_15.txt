Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies The consolidated financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board on 15 November 2010.
Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and registered in England.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Consolidated accounts are drawn up to 30 September each year and adjustments are made to the accounts of the subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of an operation, an attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been re-instated.
Any such goodwill is not included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
property, plant and equipment Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost.
The Groups licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset.
Any further decrease in value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long life landlords fixtures and fittings and short life landlords fixtures and fittings.
Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The useful economic life of additions to long life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and short life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 5 years.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 51 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment.
Where any indications are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment.
Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.
Leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as operating leases are classified in the Balance Sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within non-current assets and are amortised over the lease term.
The Group enters into sale and leaseback transactions where licensed land and buildings have been sold and the Group has immediately entered into a lease agreement with the acquiree.
These land and buildings have been classified as operating leases.
They are no longer included within Property, Plant and Equipment and the rentals paid are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of selling costs.
Licensed land and buildings and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for disposal by the Group.
They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be highly probable.
These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year.
Licensed land and buildings held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Current assets held for sale Current assets held for sale comprises tenants fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
52 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 repairs and Maintenance Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Financial instruments i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand.
Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii Borrowings Borrowings which include bank borrowings, debentures, secured bonds and securitised bonds are measured at amortised cost.
This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.
iii Derivative financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified as derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are subsequently re-stated to fair value at each reporting date.
Any change in the fair value of the instruments is recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted.
Hedge accounting is only adopted where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it meets the Groups risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge, which meets the conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
To the extent that the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur any related cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective shall be reclassified from equity to the Income Statement as a reclassification adjustment.
iv Equity instruments Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in called up share capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in share premium.
v Trade debtors and creditors Trade debtors and creditors are held at amortised cost.
Net debt Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities not including trade receivables and trade payables less cash.
Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.

Accounting policies continued Taxation The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be settled net or simultaneously.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity.
Otherwise income tax is charge in the Income Statement.
Tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amount of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
pension obligations The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees own pension plans is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The net amount recognised in the Balance Sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the schemes assets.
This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit.
The net of the expected return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Treasury shares The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, re-issued or disposed of.
Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.
54 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, volume rebates and VAT.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Sales of beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees.
Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Segmental reporting An operating segment is a distinguishable segment of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entitys chief operating decision maker CODM.
The Board reviews the Groups operations and financial position as a whole and therefore considers that it has only one operating segment, being the operation of a leased and tenanted pub estate operating solely within the UK.
The information presented to the CODM directly reflects that presented in the financial statements.
Share-based payments The Group has taken advantage of the exception in IFRS 1 in respect of equity settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each Balance Sheet date for managements best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income Statement.
A corresponding entry is made to equity.
The fair value of share options is measured using valuation models.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
operating profit Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading activities before net profit loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements in valuation of pub estate and related assets, finance costs and taxation.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 55 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued Exceptional items The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the Income Statement.
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following: a Exceptional items recognised in operating profit The exceptional revenue, cost of sales and administrative costs relate to the operation of temporary management agreements TMA.
The presentation as exceptional is based on the fact that the cost is not considered to be part of the normal course of business and it is not expected to be incurred for an extended period.
In 2010 there are additional exceptional costs recognised in the administrative costs line relating to reoganisational costs and costs incurred in respect of regulatory matters.
b Net profit loss on sale of property, plant and equipment Net profit loss arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
c Movements in valuation of pub estate and related assets Any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the Income Statement.
If that same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised.
Where pubs identified for disposal are written down to fair value less costs to sell, the associated write down is also recognised in this line.
The remaining impact of the annual revaluation exercise is accounted for in equity and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
d Movement in financial instruments The interest rate swaps are re-valued to fair value at each Balance Sheet date and the movement is recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting is adopted.
For interest rate swaps where hedge accounting is not applied the fair value movement is analysed between pre exceptional finance costs and exceptional finance costs.
Pre exceptional finance costs includes cash payments or receipts on the interest rate swaps so as to show the underlying fixed rate on the debt with the remaining fair value movement which is generally the movement in the carrying value of the swap in the period reflected as an exceptional item.
e Tax A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the Balance Sheet relating to the pub estate.
On transition to IFRS, the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999.
This led to an increase in goodwill in respect of this deferred tax.
As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief and disposals, a debit or a credit is recognised in the Income Statement.
This has been classified as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.
All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in equity and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income Statement.
56 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations During the year the Group has adopted the following new standards, interpretations and amendments: n Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective 1 October 2009 n Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items effective 1 July 2009 n Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures effective 1 October 2009 The revision to IAS 1 separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
The Statement of Changes in Equity is now shown as a primary statement.
The Group has chosen to present the new Statement of Comprehensive Income as a linked statement to the Income Statement rather than as one single statement.
Other than the amendment to IAS 1 the above have had an immaterial impact on the results of the Group.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The following standards which are relevant to the Group are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
The effective dates below represent the latest date that the Group will be required to implement the standard: n IFRS 9: Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2013 not yet endorsed n IFRS 7: Financial Instrument Disclosures effective 1 July 2011 n Amendment to IAS 17 Leases effective for accounting periods starting after 1 January 2010 use of accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: a property, plant and Equipment Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
The valuation is based on market observations and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing.
Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub.
Further information about the valuation of the pub estate is provided in note 18 of these financial statements.
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment PPE and these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year.
For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE.
b Testing goodwill for impairment The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired.
Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill to the group of CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 16.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 57 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 1.
Accounting policies continued c Valuation of interest rate swaps The Group measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each Balance Sheet date.
The swap valuation rates are derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract rate and the valuation rate for the period from the Balance Sheet date to the contracted expiry date.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
d Taxation Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a liability will arise.
The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
e other The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension liability.
However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
2. revenue The Group operates in one segment, that of leased and tenanted pub operator in the UK.

Management companies are paid to run the pubs and the Group benefits from the profits and is responsible for any losses.
The net cost of 2 million 2009 5 million comprises administrative costs of 4 million 2009 8 million being management fees and net losses.
This cost is offset by 2 million 2009 3 million of gross profit on beer sales to these pubs.
The TMA programme has now largely served its purpose and therefore no further costs are expected to be incurred.
An exceptional charge of 3 million has been incurred relating to reorganisational costs and costs incurred in respect of regulatory matters.
All other exceptional items are explained in notes 7 to 10 and 12 to 13.

During the year 71 pubs were sold as part of the Groups sale and leaseback programme.
These pubs were sold at fair value and generated proceeds of 114 million and resulted in a profit over book value, after fees, of 31 million.
These pubs were immediately leased back by the Group and are now classified as operating leases.

The deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of 330 million as the fair value of the net assets acquired had been reduced.
In previous years this pre-acquisition liability has reduced due to capital gains indexation relief, and a credit has been recognised in the Income Statement.
Indexation is calculated with reference to the movement in the Retail Price Index RPI during the year.
In the year to 30 September 2009 RPI decreased which resulted in a charge to the Income Statement.
However in the year to 30 September 2010 RPI increased which has resulted in a credit to the Income Statement.
The exceptional indexation credit for the year ended 30 September 2010 is 17 million 2009 9 million debit.

Goodwill 2010 2009 m m At 1 October 409 417 Allocated to disposals 17 8 At 30 September 392 409 Allocation to disposals In accordance with IAS 36 goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of, based on the relative value of the disposal to operations retained.
Impairment testing Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment.
For this purpose, the goodwill is allocated to the pub estate being a group of Cash Generating Units.
This represents the lowest level within the Group that goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The impairment test compares the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit with its carrying amount.
The recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flow over a five year period, as prepared for the Board.
The five year cash flows continue to be risk adjusted to reflect a conservative outlook.
They include the impact of the reduction in consumer spending as a result of the difficult economic conditions and have also been adjusted to reflect the Groups disposal programme.
The key assumptions in these estimates have been reviewed by the Board of directors and, are believed to be reasonable.
Cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a 3% growth rate 2009 3%.
The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is managements focus on an ongoing commitment to improve the quality of the estate through churn and capital expenditure whilst remaining focused on meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand.
Management uses judgement and past experience when preparing the budgeted EBITDA.

Goodwill continued The discount rate is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital WACC which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows.
In making this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted it by using an average of the highest four market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from five advisors at the year end date.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2010 was 8% 2009 8%.
As of 30 September 2010, the pre-tax adjusted discount rate could increase to 10% before any impairment would be required.
Management have considered the volatility within the current economic climate within the risk adjusted cash flow and a reduction of 3% in the growth rate of cash flows would result in no impairment.
There is no impairment to goodwill in the period.

68 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 18. property, plant and equipment continued The land and buildings were valued at market value as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book, reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield.
The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or tenancies under which the properties are let.
Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub quality and tenure.
The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK pub sector.
Land and Buildings are valued on an individual basis, however in order to give an indication as to the sensitivity of the revaluation, movements in both the total income stream and the average yield have been tested, each in isolation.
All other variables are held constant in order to assess the effect on the valuation.
This information should not be taken as a projection of likely future valuation movements as the interaction of more than one input to the valuation model on a pub by pub basis is actually assessed in the year end revaluation exercise.
Decreasing the yield used in the revaluation at 30 September 2010 by 0.25% would increase the valuation of the estate by 118 million, increasing the yield by 0.25% would decrease the valuation by 112 million.
Increasing the income streams used in the revaluation at 30 September 2010 by 0.25% would increase the valuation by 124 million, decreasing the income streams by 0.25% would decrease the valuation by 124 million.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by Humberts Leisure Limited 2,076 pubs.
The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc 1,423 pubs has been valued by the Head of Estates.
The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers.
This review ensured that the results are consistent.
A representative sample of the pubs held by Unique Pub Properties Limited Unique has been valued by Christie & Co. 200 pubs.
The method of this valuation has been applied across the rest of the Unique estate 2,853 pubs on a pub by pub basis in line with the requirements of the securitisation.
The results of both the Unique and Enterprise valuations are also compared, ensuring consistency.
During the year Christie & Co. included a Red Book Guidance Note 5 disclosure in their valuation, which requires the valuer to draw attention to uncertainty in the market which may have a material effect on the valuation.
Christie & Co. have valued 200 of the pubs from within the Unique Securitisation and state within their report that they have used valuer judgement to interpret the most recent available evidence and current market sentiment to arrive at the valuation.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale are held at fair value less costs to sell.
This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds ERV which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows: Licensed land and buildings m At 30 September 2010 Cost 3,723 Accumulated depreciation 35 Net book value 3,688 At 30 September 2009 Cost 4,018 Accumulated depreciation 36 Net book value 3,982 The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2010 was 213 million 2009 232 million.

Trade and other receivables continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances.
The Groups objective is to minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where appropriate.
The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2010 the value of collateral is 32 million 2009 31 million.
This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by licensees.

The maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest rate swaps classified as financial assets.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Group only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

The fair value of the debenture and bonds is measured at market price.
The finance lease payables are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate swaps On 30 September 2010, the 350 million swap expiring 30 September 2011 was cancelled.
The Group paid 14 million to eliminate the fair value of the swap at the date of cancellation.
This swap was previously designated as an effective hedge.
On 27 May 2010, the 275 million swap expiring 1 June 2012 was cancelled.
The Group paid 30 million to eliminate the fair value of the swap at the date of cancellation.
This swap was not designated as an effective hedge.
On 29 September 2006 the Group designated the 350 million swap referred to above as an effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39.
As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap were recognised directly in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge recognised in the Income Statement.
In line with Group accounting policy, to the extent that the forecast transaction, being the underlying debt, is no longer expected to occur, any related cumulative losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are reclassified to the Income Statement.
As a result of the Group refinancing in May 2010 a significant portion of the debt against which the interest rate swap is hedged, is no longer expected to exist due to planned reductions in the level of the debt.
This has resulted in a reclassification from the cash flow hedge reserve to the Income Statement of 19 million.
After taking into account a 5 million fair value credit the net charge to the Income Statement in relation to this interest rate swap is 14 million.
In addition to the above transactions a further 9 million was paid to restructure Group interest rate swaps.
All of the Groups swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows: 2010 2009 m m At 1 October 75 19 Cancellation of interest rate swaps 53 Fair value movements: ineffective portion and swaps not designated as effective hedges recognised in Income Statement 8 34 effective portion recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve 2 22 At 30 September 12 75 Financial instruments and risk The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds, securitised bonds and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Groups sources of finance.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions are in Sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised as follows: 74 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 23.
Financial assets and liabilities continued Liquidity risk The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank loans, debentures and securitised debt.
This objective is achieved through the following processes: n Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function n Regular review of the Groups debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile n Maintenance of undrawn bank facilities The nominal value of the Groups borrowings excluding interest rate swaps and finance lease payables comprised: 2010 2009 Bank borrowings 20% 25% Corporate bonds 35% 32% Securitised bonds 45% 43% The maturity of the Groups debt and interest payments, including interest rate swap liabilities, is set out below: 2010 2009 Debt Interest Total Debt Interest Total m m m m m m In more than five years 2,362 1,092 3,454 2,510 1,354 3,864 In more than two years but not more than five years 891 505 1,396 184 501 685 In more than one year but not more than two years 58 197 255 869 197 1,066 In one year or less or on demand 61 198 259 100 214 314 3,372 1,992 5,364 3,663 2,266 5,929 The table above shows the contractual, undiscounted cash flows due in future periods to settle the Groups debt and interest payments, including interest rate swaps.
The total amount of debt payable shown above differs from the total book value of Group debt of 3,409 million as the book value of Group debt includes the fair value of interest rate swaps which is based on discounted cash flows, and unamortised fees.
The contractual maturity of trade and other payables is within one year.

The Liquidity Facility is available to meet certain payment obligations falling due in the Unique securitisation to the extent that insufficient funds are received to meet such payments.
The Liquidity Facility is due for renewal on 30 September 2011.
The facility relates to the N note which is repayable 20272032 and therefore the facility has been disclosed as expiring in more than five years.
The new Forward Start Facility that was signed in May 2010 is fully committed and will commence in May 2011 when the current bank facility matures.
The new facility of 625 million comprises a tranche of 206 million which expires in December 2012 and a tranche of 419 million which expires in December 2013.
The overall facility will amortise at an amount of 25 million every six months, commencing in December 2011.
A margin of 3.5% is now being paid on current borrowings by lenders who are participating in the new facility.
Further details in respect of the Boards considerations on liquidity are disclosed within the Chief Executives Review on page 5 within the secure financing structure and robust cash flow section.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate risk The Group borrows its debenture and bonds except for the A2N bonds at a fixed rate.
Bank debt and the A2N bonds are borrowed at, and cash balances attract interest at, a floating rate.
The Groups objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest rate swaps acquired by Group companies.
At 30 September 2010, the Groups borrowings were 80% fixed after including the impact of interest rate swaps with an average interest rate of 6.4% for 9 years 2009 92% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for 10 years.
Interest rate sensitivity In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments we have assumed a reasonable potential change in interest rates.
The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.

The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such Group companies.
The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and secured bonds.
The value of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2010 is Property, Plant and Equipment 4,948 million 2009 5,310 million, operating lease premiums 13 million 2009 15 million and pubs held for sale 30 million 2009 43 million.
Covenants The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities.
The covenants are different for each tranche of debt and include a covenant on net debt to EBITDA, minimum EBITDA to interest, asset and debt ratios, minimum available cash flow to debt service costs and a net worth ratio.
The Group tests these covenants on a regular basis and forecasts are prepared during the budgeting process.
These are reviewed at Board level.

Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The capital structure is managed to support the Groups objective of maximising long-term shareholder value through ready access to debt and capital markets, cost effective borrowing and flexibility to fund business and acquisition opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group is based upon managements judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Groups operational and strategic requirements.
This includes a strategy on dividends, share buy backs and monitoring liquidity risk.
The overall financing strategy of the Group is presented to the Board annually as part of the budgeting exercise.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity.
Net debt is defined as the book value of the Groups debt less cash note 23.
Equity is defined as total shareholders funds.
The Board considers capital structure when recommending dividends.
Given the current degree of market uncertainty, the Board does not consider that the resumption of dividends would now be appropriate.

Leases continued The Group as lessor The Group leases its licensed estate and other non-licensed properties to tenants.
The majority of lease agreements have terms of between 1 and 30 years and are classified for accounting purposes as operating leases.
Most of the leases with terms of over 3 years include provision for rent reviews on either a 3 or 5 year basis.
The present value of future minimum lease rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2010 2009 m m Future minimum lease rentals receivable under operating leases: Within one year 199 219 After one year but not more than five years 636 721 In more than five years 1,141 1,417 1,976 2,357 Leases with future minimum lease rentals receivable under operating leases in more than five years have an average term of 14 years 2009 14 years remaining on their agreements.

This amount has been paid on the condition it will be returned if HMRC is successful in an appeal to be heard in the European Court of Justice.
The Group has therefore recognised this amount as a provision until a final decision has been handed down.
The non-currrent provision relates to future commitments under onerous lease agreements.
The provision is expected to be utilised as the pubs are disposed of.
The remaining lease terms vary from 10 to 60 years.

Deferred tax The deferred tax in the Group Balance Sheet relates to the following: 2010 2009 m m Unrealised surplus on revaluation of fixed assets and rolled over gains see note 27 a 434 500 Accelerated capital allowances see note 27 b 117 116 Fair value of interest rate swaps 7 20 Share-based payments 2 2 Temporary differences 5 3 537 591 In June 2010, the UK government announced its intention to propose Parliament reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 28% to 24% by 1 April 2014 by enacting, every year until 2014, a reduction of 1%.
At 30 September 2010 the first of these reductions, being a change in UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% on 1 April 2011, had been substantively enacted therefore the deferred tax assets and liabilities included within these Financial Statements have been calculated based on this reduced current UK corporation tax rate of 27%.
The forecast effect of the further above proposed reductions in rate by 2014 would be to decrease the net deferred tax liability by 64 million.
19 million is expected to be recognised in the Income Statement and 45 million in equity.
The government also announced that the main rate of capital allowances will fall from 20% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2012, with the rate in respect of integral features falling from 10% to 8%.
The impact on the timing of the capital allowance receipts has not been quantified as it is not practicable to do so.
a The deferred tax provision for the unrealised surplus on the revaluation of fixed assets has moved during the year as follows: 2010 m Opening provision at 1 October 2009 500 Reduction in deferred tax liability due to property disposals credited to the Income Statement 11 Reduction in deferred tax liability due to indexation credited to the Income Statement 17 Reduction in deferred tax liability due to movements from revaluation of pub estate recognised in the Income Statement 63 Increase in deferred tax liability recognised directly in equity 41 Restatement for change in UK tax rate 16 Closing provision at 30 September 2010 434 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2010 81 18532.04 03 12 10 Proof 6 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2010 27.
Deferred tax continued b Deferred tax provided in respect of Accelerated Capital Allowances ACAs increased by 6 million during 2010, from 116 million to 122 million, being the ACA tax charge detailed in note 13c.
The deferred tax balance has then been restated to reflect the change in UK tax rate.
The year end balance is therefore 117 million.
The movement is calculated as follows: Net Book Value in excess of Tax Written Down Value Tax at 28% m m Opening balance at 1 October 2009 414 116 Depreciation 7 2 Capital Allowances 28 8 Closing balance at 30 September 2010 at 28% 435 122 Restated for change in UK tax rate 5 Closing balance at 30 September 2010 at 27% 435 117 The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries on the basis that under current enacted law, no tax is payable on dividends payable and receivable within the Group.

All of the shares outstanding at 30 September 2010 are not yet exercisable.
The share price at which the number of shares granted under the STIP scheme is calculated is not confirmed until after the date of the approval of the accounts.
The maximum number of STIP shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2010.
The number of shares granted in 2009 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2009.
This number has also been changed to reflect the maximum number of shares granted in the year.
Where the conditions are not met the shares are released in the forfeited released line.
The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the STIP was 1.00 2009 0.85 restated for actual number of shares granted in 2009 and under the LTIP was 0.56 2009 0.38.

Share-based payments continued Fair value of share schemes The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using share option valuation models.
The ESOS, SAYE and STIP schemes are valued using the BlackScholes model.
The element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the BlackScholes model.
The element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.

The expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met.
This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria has therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP.
These conditions have been incorporated into the Monte Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR element of the scheme.
The 2009 weighted averages have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2009.
In the year to 30 September 2010 there were two STIP schemes are in place.
One vests equally after 2 and 3 years and the other vests after 4 years.
The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after 3, 4 and 5 years.
