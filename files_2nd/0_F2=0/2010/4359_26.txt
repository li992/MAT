The classication of reserves at 31 March 2009 has been restated to correctly analyse net investment hedges in relation to Wexford Creamery Limited between translation reserve and retained earnings.
The impact is to increase retained earnings at that date by 0.9 million and to reduce other reserves by 0.9 million translation reserve.
There is no impact on total share capital and reserves, nor on minority interests at that date.
The classication of reserves at 31 March 2008 is not affected by this change.
Tax on share based payments is now reported in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Previously these amounts were recorded in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Prior period amounts have been reclassied accordingly.
The tax on share based payments taken to equity in the year to 31 March 2010 was 0.1 million.
