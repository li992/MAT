Share repurchase At the 2010 AGM on 30th April 2010, Barclays PLC was authorised to repurchase 1,203,988,028 of its ordinary shares of 25p.
The authorisation is effective until the AGM in 2011.
No share repurchases were made during either 2010 or 2009.
30 Reserves Available for sale reserve The available for sale reserve represents the unrealised change in the fair value of available for sale investments since initial recognition.
The available for sale reserve movement of 1,236m was driven by the decrease in the fair value of the Groups investment in BlackRock, Inc. of 764m, partially offset by increases in the fair value of other available for sale assets as markets recovered.
The movement also includes the net gains transferred to net profit on disposal that arose on the disposal of the structural hedge portfolio, sovereign positions that were no longer eligible for liquidity purposes and excess Euro, US Dollar and Japanese Yen government securities.
Cash ow hedging reserve The cash ow hedging reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on effective cash ow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the income statement when the hedged transactions affect profit or loss.
Movements in the cash ow hedge reserve principally reected increases in the fair value of interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes more than offset by related gains transferred to net profit.
Currency translation reserve The currency translation reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on the retranslation of the Groups net investment in foreign operations, net of the effects of hedging.
Currency translation differences of 1,184m, including 442m associated with non-controlling interests, is largely due to the appreciation in the Rand and US Dollar, offset by the depreciation in the Euro.
During the year, 279m of the currency translation reserve was recognised in the income statement, principally as a result of the restructuring of group entities based in the US and repatriation of capital from overseas.
Other reserves and treasury shares Other reserves represent the excess of the repurchase price over the nominal of redeemed ordinary and preference shares issues by the Group.
Treasury shares are deducted from shareholders equity within other reserves and treasury shares.
A transfer is made to retained earnings in line with the vesting of treasury shares held for the purposes of share based payments.
The treasury shares primarily relate to Barclays PLC shares held by employee benefit trusts in relation to the Groups various share schemes.
These schemes are described in Note 39.
