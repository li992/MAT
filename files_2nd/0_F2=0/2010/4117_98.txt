Share capital the balance classified as share capital represents the nominal value of ordinary 10p shares issued.
Share premium the balance classified as share premium includes the net proceeds in excess of nominal value on issue of the Companys equity share capital, comprising 10p ordinary shares.
General reserve this reserve arose in 1993 when the high Court of Justice granted permission to reduce the Companys share premium account by 4,000,000 which was credited to a separate reserve named the general reserve.
Merger reserve Where shares have been issued as consideration for acquisitions, the value of shares issued in excess of nominal value has been credited to the merger reserve rather than to the share premium account.
