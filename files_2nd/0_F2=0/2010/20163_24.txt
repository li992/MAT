The consolidated financial statements for the year to 31 March 2010 comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
Separate financial statements of the Company are also presented.
The accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the Group except where separately disclosed.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 12 May 2010.
A Statement of compliance These consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and their interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted for use in the European Union IFRS.
These consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and in compliance with the Companies Act 2006.
New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB has issued the following standards and interpretations to be applied to financial statements with periods commencing on or after the following dates: Effective for period beginning on or after IAS 27 Amendment Consolidation and Separate Financial Statements 1 July 2009 IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items 1 July 2009 IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised 1 July 2009 IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners 1 July 2009 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application and have decided not to adopt early.
B Basis of preparation The financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest million pounds m except where otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The most significant techniques for estimation are described in the accounting policies relating to the investment portfolio Section E, note 13 and note 17.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The statement of comprehensive income of the Company has been omitted from these financial statements in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied across all Group entities for the purposes of producing these consolidated financial statements.
C Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Investments that are held as part of the Groups investment portfolio are carried in the balance sheet at fair value even though the Group may have significant influence over those companies.
This treatment is permitted by IAS 28 Investment in Associates, which requires investments held by venture capital organisations to be excluded from its scope where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of the change.
The Group has no interests in associates through which it carries on its business.
iii Joint ventures Interests in joint ventures that are held as part of the Groups investment portfolio are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
This treatment is permitted by IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures, which requires venturers interests held by venture capital organisations to be excluded from its scope where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of the change.
3i Group plc Report and accounts 2010 Overview Business Case Risk Corporate Governance Financial Portfolio and review studies responsibility statements other information 95 D Exchange differences i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in currencies different from the functional currency of the Group entity entering into the transaction are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling using exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of non-sterling operations The assets and liabilities of operations whose functional currency is not sterling, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of these operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated within a separate component of equity, the Translation reserve, and are released upon disposal of the non-sterling operation.
In respect of non-sterling operations, cumulative translation differences on the consolidation of non-sterling operations are being accumulated from the date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2004, and not from the original acquisition date.
E Investment portfolio i Recognition and measurement Investments are recognised and fide-recognised on a date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require the delivery or settlement of the investment.
The Group manages its investments with a view to profiting from the receipt of dividends and changes in fair value of equity investments.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted equity investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is measured using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines, details of which are in the section called Portfolio valuation an explanation.
Other investments including loan investments, bonds, fixed income shares and variable funding notes are included as loans and receivables.
Loans, bonds and fixed income shares are carried in the balance sheet at amortised cost less impairment.
For more detail see the section called Portfolio valuation an explanation.
Variable funding notes are used to invest in debt instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at the value derived from the bid prices of the underlying debt instruments taking into account the Groups obligations under the funding contract.
The fair value of loans and receivables is not anticipated to be substantially different to the holding value.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair value on a different basis, applying 3i Groups valuation policies.
ii Income Gross portfolio return is equivalent to revenue for the purposes of IAS 1.
It represents the overall increase in net assets from the investment portfolio net of dealrelated costs but excluding exchange movements.
Investment income is analysed into the following components: a Realised profits over value on the disposal of investments are the difference between the fair value of the consideration received less any directly attributable costs, on the sale of equity and the repayment of loans and receivables, and its carrying value at the start of the accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of disposal.
b Unrealised profits on the revaluation of investments are the movement in the carrying value of investments between the start and end of the accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of the movement.
c Portfolio income is that portion of income that is directly related to the return from individual investments.
It is recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must be met before the income is recognised: Income from loans and receivables is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the assets carrying value.
Dividends from equity investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an investment is first made and through the life of the investment.
Fees that are earned on a financing arrangement are considered to relate to a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised when that investment is made.
Fees that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service to the investee company are recognised as that service is provided.
F Fees receivable from external funds i Fund management fees The Group manages private equity funds, which primarily co-invest alongside the Group.
Fees earned from the ongoing management of these funds are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured.
ii Advisory fees The Group acts as investment adviser to private equity funds.
Fees earned from the provision of investment advisory services are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant investment advisory agreement.
iii Performance fees The Group earns a performance fee from funds to which it provides investment advisory services where specified performance targets are achieved.
Performance fees are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured.
iv Support services fees The Group provides support services to external funds, including accounting, treasury management, corporate secretariat and investor relations.
Fees earned from the provision of these support services are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the relevant support services agreement.
