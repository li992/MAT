The following table provides an analysis of the Groups revenue by destination.
The directors consider the only countries that are considered significant in accordance with IFRS 8 are the UK and USA as disclosed above.
5. Business segments IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive and the Board of Directors to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
For management purposes the Group has four operating divisions Countermeasures, Counter-IED, Pyrotechnics and Munitions.
These divisions are the basis on which it reports its segmental information and the principal activities are as follows: Countermeasures Expendable active and passive countermeasures for naval and air platforms: land-based electronic warfare EW equipment.
Counter-IED: IED Improvised Explosive Device detection equipment: IED electronic countermeasures: explosive ordnance disposal equipment: demilitarisation services.
Pyrotechnics: Signals and illumination devices and payloads: cartridge propellant actuated devices: pyrotechnic devices for satellite launch and deployment.
Munitions: Missile and ammunition components: propellants: warheads: fuzes: energetic materials: medium and large calibre ammunition.

Intra-group transactions There are no intra-group transactions included within the above figures for revenue and profit.
Information about major customers Included in revenues arising from the segments are revenues of approximately 236.7 million 2009: 195.4 million which arose from sales to the Groups largest customer, the US Department of Defense.
This was the only individual customer where direct sales account for more than 10% of the total Group revenue for the year.
Restructuring costs In the second half of the year a decision was taken to restructure the Groups UK counter-IED business at a cost of 1.5 million.
As a result, one of the two sites out of which it operated was closed.
The benefits of this closure will be seen in the current financial year.
The 2.9 million of restructuring costs in 2009 related to the UK countermeasures business and Chemring Ordnance in the USA.
Incident costs In September 2010 two separate incidents stopped production at the Kilgore Flares facility in Tennessee and the Groups newly acquired subsidiary Mecar in Belgium.
As a result of these incidents approximately 7.0 million of revenue and 3.0 million of underlying operating profit was deferred into the current financial year.
In addition, 2.8 million of non-recurring costs arising out of the incidents were incurred in respect of the write-off of damaged stock and destroyed assets.
Provision release During the second half of the year, a third party assessment was carried out of the provision held in respect of the environmental liabilities associated with the Chemring Energetic Devices site in Illinois, USA.
After taking into account this assessment and the additional insurance coverage that was secured in respect of this exposure during the year, the Group has released part of the provision.
The Group does not disclose assets or liabilities by segment in the monthly management accounts provided to the Executive Committee or the Board of Directors.
The Improvements to IFRSs issued in April 2009 only requires information provided to the chief operating decision maker as a key decision making tool to be disclosed.
The Group has adopted this amendment in order to clarify that the chief operational decision makers do not use this as a key decision tool.
There were no material changes to the numbers disclosed for the year ended 31 October 2009 in arriving at the IFRS 8 Operating Segments disclosure, in which the additional information was disclosed.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, the growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured the weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The discount rate used is based on the Group pre-tax WACC of 7.4% 2009: 7.8% and adjusted for a premium specific to each CGU.
The calculation has used the Groups budgeted figures for the next five years.
At the end of five years, it assumes the performance of the Group companies will continue in perpetuity at the fifth year level.
The growth rates are based on managements view of industry growth forecasts, adjusted for a premium associated with the high technological nature of the businesses.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth as described above.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses for continuing operations have been recognised in the year and no prior impairment losses reversed.
There was significant headroom within all the value in use calculations.
Additionally, sensitivity analysis has indicated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

No interest is charged on the receivables from the date of invoice to payment.
The Groups policy is to provide in full for debtors greater than 120 days beyond agreed terms, unless extenuating circumstances exist.
Due to the nature of the customer base the Group does not experience significant bad debt write-offs and hence no movement schedule for the allowance for doubtful debts has been provided due to its immaterial level in 2010 and 2009.
The increase in the year is due to acquisitions.
An ageing analysis has not been shown as all significant overdue receivables are covered by the allowance for doubtful debts provision above.

Bank loans held with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania USA were secured on the related assets purchased with these loans by Alloy Surfaces Company, Inc.
The security over the loan notes ranked pari passu with that held by Lloyds Banking Group.
As described in Note 36, the Group refinanced its facilities with Lloyds Banking Group with a new syndicate of five banks on 14 January 2011.
The new facilities are unsecured, and the security over the loan notes has therefore also now been released.
Other loans represent the regional development loan which was acquired on the acquisition of Mecar S. A. see Note 32.

Financial instruments and risk management The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial and commercial risk wherever it is appropriate to do so.
The main risks addressed by the financial instruments of the Group are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies in respect of the management of these risks, which remained unchanged throughout the year, were as follows: The Groups multi-national activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: Forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investments in overseas businesses which have currencies other than sterling as their functional currency.
Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
Forward currency structures to hedge the exchange risk arising on translation of the overseas business profits.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Foreign currency exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation risk: Transactional risk: The Group policy is to hedge significant transactional currency exposures via the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The measurement and control of this risk is closely monitored on a Group-wide basis.
Translation risk: The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 3.
The translation risk on net assets is mitigated by the transfer of currencies between Group companies and the appropriate use of foreign currency borrowings.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010 74 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 24.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year end were as follows: 2010 2009 US$ Euro NOK AUS$ US$ Euro NOK AUS$ Monetary assets million 154.6 69.2 48.7 10.5 100.9 34.1 36.8 4.8 Monetary liabilities million 312.5 105.1 17.5 6.9 185.3 84.7 42.1 2.0 Currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings.
The borrowings detailed below were designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges.
2010 2009 US$ Euro NOK AUS$ US$ Euro NOK AUS$ Borrowings million 405.0 53.1 35.0 - 147.1 57.6 33.9 - The Group uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the year end.
When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
The most significant exchange rate to manage as far as the Group is concerned is the sterling: US dollar exchange rate.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for sales of foreign currencies outstanding as at the year end: Average exchange rate Expiring within one year 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m US dollar 1.65 1.66 84.2 39.4 Euro Nil 1.01 Nil 1.2 At the year end, there was one US dollar structure in place which was set up to protect the Income Statement from currency fluctuations during 2010 and through to October 2011, which provides an economic hedge.
The structure involves a cap and a collar, which lock in the exchange rates to give the Group the appropriate protection.
However, the structure does not give linear relationships with the gain or loss from re-translation of future profits and hence hedge accounting has not been adopted for this financial instrument.
A loss for the year ended 31 October 2010 has arisen due to the continual fluctuation of foreign currency markets since the new structure was implemented in January 2010.
The Group continues to protect its foreign currency position with a fixed rate of $1.64 in the year to October 2011 and $1.57 in the year to 31 October 2012.
The principal amounts of the Groups Euro, NOK and US dollar bank loans and loan notes have been accounted for as net investment hedges on the European, Norwegian and US businesses.
These hedges are effective throughout the year and the losses arising on translation have been offset against the gains on re-translation of the subsidiaries in reserves.
Interest on borrowing is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into except for interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risks.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10 cents movement in the relevant foreign currencies against sterling.
10 cents represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10 cents change in foreign currency rates.
A negative number indicates a decrease in profit and equity where sterling strengthens against the relevant currency.
US dollar impact Euro impact 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m Loss 15.2 9.8 3.0 4.6 Other equity 15.2 9.8 3.0 4.6 The Groups sensitivity to foreign currency increased during the year, mainly due to the growth of the US and European subsidiaries.
These potential losses arising on the year end foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities would be more than offset by future translation and transaction gains.
As such, in managements opinion the sensitivity analysis above is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk, as the year end exposure does not reflect the lower exposure during the year.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and leasing lines of credit.
The UK borrowings are denominated in sterling, Euro, US dollar and Norwegian Kroner, and during the year were subject to floating rates of interest linked to the Lloyds Banking Group base rate.
In order to protect against the risk of higher interest rates, the Group has entered into amortising interest rate swaps for the majority of its UK borrowings.
The overseas borrowings are denominated in local currency and are predominantly subject to fixed rates of interest.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 75 During 2007, the Group refinanced part of its Lloyds Banking Group borrowing facilities with a private placement of ten year fixed interest loan notes in the US.
The arrangement provides a natural hedge against the Groups investment structure in its US businesses.
These loan notes are repayable in full in 2017.
During 2009, the Group undertook another refinancing of part of its Lloyds Banking Group borrowing facilities with private placements of seven and ten year fixed interest loan notes in the US.
This arrangement also provides a natural hedge against the Groups investment structure in its US businesses.
These loan notes are repayable in full in 2016 and 2019.
Euro, NOK and sterling floating rate borrowings have interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on the floating rate debt and were all designated as cash flow hedges.
The sterling loan was repaid in November 2009 and as such the interest rate hedge was fide-recognised at the year end.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date.

The range represents the two applicable interest rates incurred during the swap contracts.
The swap instruments match the interest payment profiles of the medium term debt.

These are used to offset the interest charged on the UK overdraft which bears interest at 0.5% above LIBOR.
Cash at bank and in hand consists primarily of overseas funds which are used as short term intra-group financing as well as an internal exchange rate hedge.
The maturity profile for other financial assets and financial liabilities consisting of receivables and payables can be considered less than one year, as identified from the Balance Sheet.
The weighted average interest rate of fixed rate financial liabilities at 31 October 2010 was 5.6% 2009: 5.5% and the weighted average period of funding was six years 2009: five years.
Derivative financial instruments The Group has three amortising interest rate swaps, from floating to fixed rate: one that expires in 2014 at a rate of 3.6-4.76% sterling : one that expires in 2014 at a rate of 3.67-4.35% Euro and one that expires in 2012 at a rate of 5.495% NOK.
The fair value of interest rate swaps recognised on the Balance Sheet at 31 October 2010 was 5.7 million liability 2009: 4.8 million liability.
The Group also has two forward exchange contracts with a fair value of 3.2 million liability 2009: nil and 1.9 million asset 2009: 0.2 million asset.
The total of these financial instruments is a 7.0 million liability 2009: 4.6 million liability.

The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivable consists of a small number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas.
Customers are mainly multi-national organisations or government agencies with whom the Group has long term business relationships.
The majority of the Groups business is with the US Department of Defense and the UK Ministry of Defence, and as such the credit risk on debtors is considered to be very low.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, when appropriate, action is taken to minimise the credit risk to the Group.
The Groups price risk is principally in relation to the cost of raw materials and is not considered significant.
Price risk is managed through negotiations with suppliers and, where appropriate, the agreement of fixed price supply contracts.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity, excluding non-redeemable preference shares and minority interests, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on the market prices.
Primarily, the shares are intended to be used for satisfying awards under the Groups share-based incentive schemes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
The Group does not have a defined share buy back plan.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

This is expected to be utilised over a period of greater than five years.
The warranty provisions at 31 October 2010 are held by Simmel Difesa S. p. A. and represent managements best estimate of the Groups liability under six year warranties, based on past experience for defective products.
The restructuring provisions at 31 October 2010 relate to Chemring Countermeasures Limited and Chemring EOD Limited.

The impact of the rate reduction has been reflected in the calculation of the UK deferred tax liability provided at 31 October 2010.
Therefore, a credit of 1.3 million has been included within the deferred tax charge for the year.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main tax rate of 1% each year down to 24% by 1 April 2014.
The future 1% main tax rate reductions are expected to have a similar impact on the Groups financial statements as outlined above, subject to the impact of other developments in the Groups tax position which may reduce the beneficial effect of this in the Groups tax rate.
As the further reductions in UK Corporate tax rates have not been substantially enacted at the Balance Sheet date, this is considered a non-adjusting event in accordance with IAS 10 and no adjustments have been made.
The impact of any further reduction will be taken into account at subsequent reporting dates, once the change has been substantively enacted.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Deferred tax balances after offset, for balance sheet purposes, and are analysed as follows: 2010 2009 m m Deferred tax liabilities 52.4 22.6 Deferred tax assets 16.6 17.7 35.8 4.9 At the Balance Sheet date the Group had unrecognised tax losses of 72.6 million 2009: 4.9 million potentially available for offset against future profits in certain circumstances, with the majority arising from recent acquisitions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount either because of the unpredictability of short term future qualifying profit streams or, as explained in Note 32, because the initial measurement period was incomplete as at the Balance Sheet date and so the fair values stated are provisional.

A, a fellow Group company.
The acquisition is designed to provide synergies from vertical integration and security in the continued supply of fuzes.
The company was acquired for 10.2 million, which resulted in goodwill of 4.9 million subsequently revised to 2.8 million due to additional deferred tax assets identified within the company and acquired intangibles of 7.2 million.
The trade and assets of Mecar USA, Inc. now owned by Chemring Military Products, Inc. were acquired alongside Mecar S. A. on 1 September 2010, by way of a cash purchase of 9.0 million.
This resulted in goodwill of 3.5 million and acquired intangibles of 2.8 million.
The acquisitions during 2010 were completed in order to give the Group increased access into markets such as space, as well as allowing synergies from the combined companies.
Further information can be found in the Review by the Chief Executive.
For the above acquisitions the initial measurement period was incomplete as at the Balance Sheet date and so the fair values stated are all provisional.
The only measurement period adjustment related to the identification of additional deferred tax assets in Chemring Fuze Technology S. r. l. as noted above.
Adjustments from book value to provisional fair value arise principally from the application of Group accounting policies on working capital and the recognition of intangible assets under IFRS 3 Business Combinations and Fair Value Adjustments to Inventories, Receivables, Property, Plant and Equipment.
Intangible assets relate principally to customer relationships and technology.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess of total cost over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Goodwill represents the value of synergies and assembled workforces acquired and future profits from new markets.
The acquisitions during the year contributed 26.5 million of revenue and 2.0 million to the Groups profit before interest and tax for the period between the dates of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue and profit before tax for the year would have been approximately 649.0 million and 92.5 million respectively.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, nor of the future results of the combined operations.

Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a defined benefit scheme the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme.
In Germany, Chemring Defence Germany GmbH operates a defined benefit scheme the Chemring Defence Germany Scheme and in Norway, Chemring Nobel AS operates a defined benefit scheme the Chemring Nobel Scheme.
The other UK and overseas arrangements are all defined contribution schemes with a combined cost of 5.3 million 2009: 4.5 million.
The Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme is a funded scheme and the assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
A full actuarial valuation for the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme as at 6 April 2009 has been prepared and updated to 31 October 2010 by a qualified actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The main assumptions for the scheme are detailed below.
The Group has given a bank guarantee to the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme of 7.2 million.
The guarantee may be drawn upon in certain events of default by the Company.
The Group has also placed 15.0 million in an escrow account to provide additional funding for the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme in the event of a default see Note 20.
The Chemring Defence Germany Scheme is an unfunded scheme.
The actuarial liability has been calculated at 31 October 2010 by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The main assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.3%, inflation rate of 1.8% and rate of increase in deferred pensions of nil%.
The net deficit of the Chemring Defence Germany Scheme was 1.3 million at 31 October 2010 2009: 1.2 million.
The Chemring Nobel Scheme is an unfunded scheme.

For the Staff Scheme, the actuarial table currently used is SAPS Year of Birth Tables with a medium cohort and 1% underpin.
Life expectancy at 65: 2010 2009 Future pensioners - male 88.5 88.2 - female 91.9 91.0 Current pensioners - male 86.6 86.3 - female 89.8 89.1 The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate in the scheme were to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the scheme would change by approximately 1.1 million.
A change in the rate of inflation by 0.1% is predicted to change the deficit by approximately 0.6 million and a one year change to longevity assumption would change the deficit by approximately 1.7 million.
The Group anticipates contributions to the defined benefit schemes for the year ending 31 October 2011 will be 2.0 million 2010: 1.9 million.

The Group has been self insured for the first 2.5 million of material damage and business interruption cover, subject to a maximum liability of 3.5 million in any one year, since 31 October 2001.
Insurance cover in respect of this risk at a level over that disclosed here was placed with external insurers.

The Group enters into contracts which sometimes have offset commitments.
These requirements are valued at the time of the contract being awarded.
The cost of the offsets is reviewed throughout the contract life and provided to the extent of the potential liability.
