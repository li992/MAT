The fair value of interest rate swaps is measured by reference to the cost of foreclosing the swap position at the year end.
The fair value of the senior notes and the swaps are measured by reference to observable market interest rate information as no similar instrument is available due to the specific profiles of the loans.
They are considered to be level two in the fair value hierarchy.
None of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps is attributable to changes in the Groups credit risk.
Risk management The Group is exposed to market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Group Treasury is charged with managing and controlling risk relating to the financing and liquidity of the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury does not enter into speculative transactions.
