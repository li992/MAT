44 Financial risks, liquidity and capital management The disclosures required under IFRS relating to financial risks and capital resources have been included within the Risk management and governance section on pages 82 to 136.
This move has been to improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, and to reduce duplication.
The relevant disclosures havbe been marked as audited and can be found as follows: credit risk, on pages 82 to 117: market risk, on pages 118 to 125: capital resources, on pages 126 to 130: and liquidity risk, on pages 131 to 136.
45 Critical accounting estimates The Groups accounting policies are set out on pages 194 to 205.
Certain of these policies, as well as estimates made by management, are considered to be important to an understanding of the Groups financial condition since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgements and estimates, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain.
The following accounting policies include estimates which are particularly sensitive in terms of judgements and the extent to which estimates are used.
Other accounting policies involve significant amounts of judgements and estimates, but the total amounts involved are not significant to the financial statements.
Management has discussed the accounting policies and critical accounting estimates with the Board Audit Committee.
Fair value of financial instruments Some of the Groups financial instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss, such as those held for trading, designated by management under the fair value option and non-cash ow hedging derivatives.
Other non-derivative financial assets may be designated as available for sale.
Available for sale financial investments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently held at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of such assets are included as a separate component of equity.
An analysis of financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation hierarchy, particulars of the valuation techniques used and a sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs is included in Note 41.
This note also includes a discussion of the more judgemental aspects of valuation in the period, including: credit valuation adjustments on monoline exposures, commercial real estate loans, private equity investments, and fair value loans to government and business and other services.
Approximately 2.6bn of the assets acquired as part of the 2008 acquisition of the North American business of Lehman Brothers had not been received by 31st December 2010.
Approximately 2.0bn of this amount was recognised as part of the acquisition accounting and is included as an available for sale asset in the balance sheet.
As discussed in Note 26, on 22nd February 2011 the Court issued its Opinion in relation to the related legal proceedings.
This Opinion holds that Barclays is not entitled to receive approximately 1.3bn, and is only conditionally entitled to receive approximately 0.5bn, of the undelivered assets.
In addition, the Opinion holds that Barclays is not entitled to approximately 1.3bn of assets it has already received.
