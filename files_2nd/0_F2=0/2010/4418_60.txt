14 Shareholding guideline It is one of the tenets of Kesas reward strategy that shareholders and Directors interests be aligned.
To reinforce this, the Remuneration Committee expects that over a period of years Executive Directors will build a personal holding in Kesa shares.
To underpin this commitment, the Committee expects that, while the guideline holding remains unfulfilled, Executive Directors will not dispose of any shares vesting to them under any of the Kesa incentive plans save for any disposals necessary to meet tax liabilities arising from them, until they hold shares worth the following percentage of their base salary.
