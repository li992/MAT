The provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices or future assumptions, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a real discount rate of 1.5% 2009 1.75%.
These costs are generally expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 1.5% 2009 1.75%.
The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of the liability.
The litigation category includes provisions for matters related to, for example, commercial disputes, product liability, and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances.
Included within the other category at 31 December 2010 are provisions for deferred employee compensation of $728 million 2009 $789 million and for expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties of $45 million 2009 $246 million.
These provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 3.75% 2009 4.0% or a real discount rate of 1.5% 2009 1.75%, as appropriate.

Provisions continued Provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill The Gulf of Mexico oil spill is described on pages 34 to 39 and in Note 2.
Provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, included in the table above, are separately presented below: $ million Litigation and Clean Water Environmental Spill response claims Act penalties Total At 1 January 2010 New or increased provisions 929 10,883 14,939 3,510 30,261 Unwinding of discount 4 4 Change in discount rate 5 5 Utilization 129 9,840 3,966 13,935 At 31 December 2010 809 1,043 10,973 3,510 16,335 Of which current 314 982 6,642 7,938 non-current 495 61 4,331 3,510 8,397 Of which payable from the trust fund 382 9,162 9,544 As described in Note 2, BP has recorded provisions at 31 December 2010 relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill including amounts in relation to environmental expenditure, spill response costs, litigation and claims, and Clean Water Act penalties, each of which is described below.
Environmental The amounts committed by BP for a 10-year research programme to study the impact of the incident on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico have been provided for.
BPs commitment is to provide $500 million of funding, and the remaining commitment, on a discounted basis, of $427 million was included in provisions at 31 December 2010.
This amount is expected to be spent evenly over the 10-year period.
As a responsible party under the OPA 90, BP faces claims by the United States, as well as by State, tribal, and foreign trustees, if any, for natural resource damages Natural Resource Damages claims.
These damages include, amongst other things, the reasonable costs of assessing the injury to natural resources as well as some emergency restoration projects which are expected to occur over the next two years.
BP has been incurring natural resource damage assessment costs and a provision has been made for the estimated costs of the assessment phase.
The assessment covers a large area of potential impact and will take some time to complete in order to determine both the severity and duration of the impact of the oil spill.
The process of interpreting the large volume of data collected is expected to take at least several months and, in order to determine potential injuries to certain animal populations, data will need to be collected over one or more reproductive cycles.
This expected assessment spend is based upon past experience as well as identified projects.
A provision of $382 million has been established for these items.
Until the size, location and duration of the impact is assessed, it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amounts or timing of the remaining Natural Resource Damages claims, therefore no amounts have been provided for these items and they are disclosed as a contingent liability.
See Note 44 for further information.
Spill response The remaining provision for spill response includes the estimated future costs of both subsea operations as well as surface and shoreline work.
The subsea response provision is based on the remaining activities expected to be undertaken and has been calculated using daily rates of costs incurred to date.
This includes the rig costs to complete the plugging and abandonment of the second relief well, which is in progress and is expected to complete in early March 2011, and the recovery of the subsea infrastructure used as part of the various containment systems.
The majority of the vessels involved in the response have now been decontaminated.
The provision includes the costs of decontaminating the remaining 25 vessels, which is expected to be complete by the end of April 2011.
The provision for surface and shoreline response is based on the daily costs currently being incurred which are underpinned by headcount, equipment and the number of vessels on hire.
At the end of the year, there were approximately 360 vessels on hire and the number of personnel involved in response activities was approximately 6,200.
BP and the US Coast Guard are working closely with state and local officials to clean Gulf Coast beaches before the 2011 spring and summer tourism seasons and this is the basis on which the provision at 31 December 2010 has been calculated.
The provision also includes an estimate of future federal response costs and ongoing monitoring that will be required until the end of the second quarter of 2012.
Litigation and claims Individual and Business Claims, and State and Local Claims under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 and claims for personal injury BP faces claims under OPA 90 by individuals and businesses for removal costs, damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity, loss of subsistence use of natural resources and for personal injury Individual and Business Claims and by state and local government entities for removal costs, physical damage to real or personal property, loss of government revenue and increased public services costs State and Local Claims.
The estimated future cost of settling Individual and Business Claims, State and Local Claims under OPA 90 and claims for personal injuries, both reported and unreported, has been provided for.
Claims administration costs have also been provided for.
BP believes that the history of claims received to date, and settlements made, provides sufficient data to enable the company to use an approach based on a combination of actuarial methods and management judgements to estimate IBNR Incurred But Not Reported claims to determine a reliable best estimate of BPs exposure for claims not yet reported in relation to Individual and Business claims, and State and Local claims under OPA 90.
The amount provided for these claims has been determined in accordance with IFRS and represents BPs current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle its obligations at the balance sheet date.
The measurement of this provision is subject to significant uncertainty.
Actual costs could ultimately be significantly higher or lower than those recorded as the claims and settlement process progresses.
In estimating the amount of the provision, BP has determined a range of possible outcomes for Individual and Business Claims, and State and Local Claims.
These determinations are based on BPs claims payment experience, the application of insurance industry benchmark data, the use of a combination of actuarial and statistical methods and management judgements where appropriate.
The methods selected are consistent with those used by the insurance industry to estimate a range of total expenditures for both reported and unreported claims.
These methods have been adopted on the basis that, at this stage of development, the application of insurance industry standard techniques for the estimation of ultimate losses is an appropriate approach for the costs arising from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Provisions continued Through the application of this approach, BP has concluded that a reasonable range of possible outcomes for the amount of the provision as at 31 December 2010 is $6 billion to $13 billion.
BP believes that the provision recorded at 31 December 2010 of $9.2 billion represents a reliable best estimate from within this range of possible outcomes.
This amount is shown as payable from the trust fund under Litigation and claims in the table above.
The provision is in addition to the $3.4 billion of claims paid in 2010.
Of this total paid, $3.2 billion is included within utilization of provision in the table, and the remaining $0.2 billion was a period expenditure prior to the recognition of the provision at the end of the second quarter 2010.
Also included within the total utilization of provision of $4 billion under Litigation and claims are amounts relating to claims administration costs and legal fees.
Of the total payments of $3.4 billion during the year, $3 billion was paid out of the trust fund and $0.4 billion was paid by BP.
BPs management has utilized actuarial techniques and its judgement in determining this reliable best estimate.
However, it is possible that the final outcome could lie outside this range.
Many key assumptions underlie and influence both the range of possible outcomes and the reliable best estimates of total expenditures derived for both categories of claims.
These key assumptions include the amounts that will ultimately be paid in relation to current claims, the number, type and amounts for claims not yet reported, the scope and number of claims that can be resolved successfully in the claims process, the resolution of rejected claims, the outcomes of any litigation, the effects on tourism and fisheries and other economic and environmental factors.
The outcomes of claims and litigation are likely to be paid out over many years to come.
BP will re-evaluate the assumptions underlying this analysis on a quarterly basis as more information becomes available and the claims process matures.
BP also faces other litigation for which no reliable estimate of the cost can currently be made.
Therefore no amounts have been provided for these items.
Legal fees Estimated legal fees have been provided for where we have been able to estimate reliably those which will arise in the next two years.
Clean Water Act penalties A provision has been made for the estimated penalties for strict liability under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act.
Such penalties are subject to a statutory maximum calculated as the product of a per-barrel maximum penalty rate and the number of barrels of oil spilled.
Uncertainties currently exist in relation to both the per-barrel penalty rate that will ultimately be imposed and the volume of oil spilled.
A charge for potential Clean Water Act Section 311 penalties was first included in BPs second-quarter 2010 interim financial statements.
At the time that charge was taken, the latest estimate from the intra-agency Flow Rate Technical Group created by the National Incident Commander in charge of the spill response was between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day.
The mid-point of that range, 47,500 barrels per day, was used for the purposes of calculating the charge.
For the purposes of calculating the amount of the oil flow that was discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, the amount of oil that had been or was projected to be captured in vessels on the surface was subtracted from the total estimated flow up until when the well was capped on 15 July 2010.
The result of this calculation was an estimate that approximately 3.2 million barrels of oil had been discharged into the Gulf.
This estimate of 3.2 million barrels was calculated using a total flow of 47,500 barrels per day multiplied by the 85 days from 22 April 2010 through 15 July 2010 less an estimate of the amount captured on the surface approximately 850,000 barrels.
This estimated discharge volume was then multiplied by $1,100 per barrel the maximum amount the statute allows in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct for the purposes of estimating a potential penalty.
This resulted in a provision of $3,510 million for potential penalties under Section 311.
In utilizing the $1,100 per-barrel input, the company took into account that the actual per-barrel penalty a court may impose, or that the Government might agree to in settlement, could be lower than $1,100 per barrel if it were determined that such a lower penalty was appropriate based on the factors a court is directed to consider in assessing a penalty.
In particular, in determining the amount of a civil penalty, Section 311 directs a court to consider a number of enumerated factors, including the seriousness of the violation or violations, the economic benefit to the violator, if any, resulting from the violation, the degree of culpability involved, any other penalty for the same incident, any history of prior violations, the nature, extent, and degree of success of any efforts of the violator to minimize or mitigate the effects of the discharge, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and any other matters as justice may require.
Civil penalties above $1,100 per barrel up to a statutory maximum of $4,300 per barrel of oil discharged would only be imposed if gross negligence or wilful misconduct were alleged and subsequently proven.
The company expects to seek assessment of a penalty lower than $1,100 per barrel based on several of these factors.
However, the $1,100 per-barrel rate was utilized for the purposes of calculating a charge after considering and weighing all possible outcomes and in light of: i the companys conclusion that it did not act with gross negligence or engage in wilful misconduct: and ii the uncertainty as to whether a court would assess a penalty below the $1,100 statutory maximum.
On 2 August 2010, the United States Department of Energy and the Flow Rate Technical Group had issued an estimate that 4.9 million barrels of oil had flowed from the Macondo well, and 4.05 million barrels had been discharged into the Gulf the difference being the amount of oil captured by vessels on the surface as part of BPs well containment efforts.
It was and remains BPs view, based on the analysis of available data by its experts, that the 2 August 2010 Government estimate and other similar estimates are not reliable estimates because they are based on incomplete or inaccurate information, rest in large part on assumptions that have not been validated, and are subject to far greater uncertainties than have been acknowledged.
As BP has publicly asserted, including at a 22 October 2010 meeting with the staff of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, the company believes that the 2 August 2010 discharge estimate and similar estimates are overstated by a significant amount, and that the flow rate is potentially in the range of 20-50% lower.
If the flow rate is 50% lower than the 2 August 2010 estimate, then the amount of oil that flowed from the Macondo well would be approximately 2.5 million barrels, and the amount discharged into the Gulf would be approximately 1.6 million barrels.
If the flow rate is 20% lower than the 2 August 2010 estimate, then the amount of oil that flowed from the Macondo well would be approximately 3.9 million barrels and the amount discharged into the Gulf would be approximately 3.1 million barrels, which is not materially different from the amount we used for our original estimate at the second quarter.
