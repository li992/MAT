Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2010 Page 39 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and the AIC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Trusts issued in January 2009. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
A resolution proposing the continuation of the Company as an investment trust will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 15 December 2010.
The Directors are recommending that shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
In light of their recommendation and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18: Accounting Policies, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Accordingly the financial statements do not include any adjustments that may arise from a reconstruction or liquidation of the Company.
Such adjustments would include expenses of reconstruction or liquidation along with any costs associated with realising the portfolio.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short term deposits is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash foregone, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where appropriate, certain derivatives such as Contracts For Difference CFDs are used.
Income received from dividends on long CFDs and interest received on short CFDs and expenses paid out as dividends on short CFDs and interest paid on long CFDs are included in Net derivative income expenses in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Finance costs are accounted for using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
e Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
g Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key management personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially, and subsequently measured, at fair value, which is measured as follows: Listed investments and AIM quoted investments are valued at bid prices, or last prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: Unlisted investments where there is not an active market are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establis h what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date.
Transaction costs In accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes these costs in the cost of investments purchased or sold and has disclosed them in Note 10 on page 45. h Derivative instruments Where appropriate, certain permitted transactions involving derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter comprise futures, equity forwards, CFDs and options and are measured at fair value.
The fair value is as follows: Futures and options the quoted trade price for the contract: CFDs and equity forwards - the difference between the strike price and the bid or last price of the underlying shares in the contract.
Page 40 Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued h Derivative instruments continued Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, then the income and expenses derived from them are included in Net derivative expenses via the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the gains and losses derived from them are included in Gains losses on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss via the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within Current assets and Creditors - amounts falling due within one year.
As part of an established policy, premiums received on written options are taken to capital and are recognised within the gains losses on derivative instruments via the capital column of the Income Statement.
i Loans Following the repayment of the last remaining loan, the Company has no financial gearing via bank loans.
However, the Company still maintains a geared position through the use of derivatives.
For the prior year, the loan was initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loan was measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost was calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
j Capital reserve The following are accounted for in capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments, including derivative assets and liabilities: Changes in fair value of the investments, including derivative assets and liabilities, held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: Costs of repurchasing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 01 08: Distributable Profits, changes in fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the balance sheet date, can be treated as realised.
At the balance sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash with the exception of unlisted investments with a fair value of 86,000. k Dividends In accordance with FRS21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date.

This Note is incorporated in accordance with FRS29 and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Derivative instruments which comprise futures, equity forwards, CFDs and options listed on stocks and equity indices The risks identified by FRS29 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises other price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Market price risk Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly to do with the underlying exposures, are estimated using Value at Risk and Stress Tests as set out in accordance with the Companys Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing had previously been obtained through a UK sterling denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loan, which was repaid on 26 January 2010.
The Company still has gearing through the use of derivative instruments.
The Board imposes limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
The Company is exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increases in interest rates associated with the funding of the derivative instruments.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The Company is exposed to cash flow interest risk on the long and short CFDs, cash at bank and amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers.
The Company was exposed to a fair value interest rate risk on the fixed rate unsecured loan repaid during the year.
The total exposure via long and short CFDs is shown in Note 11 on page 46 and cash at bank and amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers are shown in the Balance Sheet on page 37.
Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency which is sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments have been used for gearing and investment rather than hedging purposes.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.

Page 50 Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Currency exposure of financial liabilities The Company finances its investment activities through its ordinary share capital, reserves and gearing via the use of derivative instruments.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise the fair value of underlying securities within short CFDs and written options and its short term creditors.
The currency cash flow profile of these financial liabilities is shown below.

Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Counterparty risk All securities and derivative instruments are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
All counterparties for any type of trading are assessed by an independent Credit Research and Analysis function and approved for use by any Fidelity managed company.
Exposures to counterparties are monitored and reported frequently.
Margin on exchange-traded derivatives mitigates counterparty risk exposure in accordance with the terms outlined in market standard ISDA derivative legal contracts.
Credit risk Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank, outstanding securities transactions and the derivative instruments at fair value.
Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2010 Page 51 Notes to the Financial Statements 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments, are set out in a documented Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document, details of which can be seen in the other risk categories disclosed on pages 49 to 51.
As set out in a documented Derivative Instrument Charter, the derivative instruments are used by the Manager for the following purposes: To gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial flow of capital.
To hedge equity market risk via derivatives with the intention of at least partially mitigating losses in the exposures in th e Companys portfolio as a result of falls in the equity market.
To enhance portfolio returns by writing call and put options.
To position short exposures in the Companys portfolio.
These uncovered exposures benefit from falls in the prices of share s which the Portfolio Manager believes to be over valued.
These positions therefore distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and performance contribution of these instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist derivatives team which draws on over forty years of specialist experience in derivative risk management.
This team draws upon sophisticated portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Manager on portfolio construction.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Other price risk sensitivity analysis Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives can be found on pages 21 and 22 of the Directors Report.
An increase of 10% in the fair value of the investments excluding derivatives at 31 August 2010 would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 32,366,000 2009: 35,538,000.
A decrease of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The analysis for 2009 is performed on the same basis.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis At 31 August 2010, if interest rates had increased by 0.5% the total return on ordinary activities would have increased by 37,000 2009: 53,000.
A decrease in the interest rates by 0.5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis At 31 August 2010, if sterling had strengthened by 10% against the foreign currency exposures, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by 577,000 2009: 1,383,000.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the foreign currency exposures, with all other variables held constant, would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 705,000 2009: 1,690,000.
Derivative instruments exposure sensitivity analysis Equity derivatives The Company invests in CFDs to gain exposure to the equity markets.
A 10% fall in the price of shares underlying the CFDs at 31 August 2010 would have resulted in a decrease of 1,921,000 2009: 206,000 in the Companys total net asset value.
A rise of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
At the year end the Company had no equity forwards exposure to the equity markets 2009: 24,000.
At the year end the Company had no futures exposure to the equity markets 2009: nil.
Options The Company writes call options on selected underlying equity positions, receiving a premium, but obligating it to sell the physical stock at a fixed price.
Using the deltas of the options at 31 August 2010, where an options delta is a ratio that compares the change in the price of the underlying equity to the corresponding change in the price of the option, a 10% change in the price of the underlying equities would have resulted in a decrease of 88,000 2009: 323,000 in the Companys total net asset value.
Page 52 Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2010 Notes to the Financial Statements 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Options continued The Company also writes put options on selected underlying equity positions, receiving a premium, but obligating it to purchase the physical stock at a fixed price.
Using the deltas of the options at 31 August 2010, where an options delta is a ratio that compares the change in the price of the underlying equity to the corresponding change in the price of the option, a 10% change in the price of the underlying equities would have resulted in an increase of 287,000 2009: 62,000 in the Companys total net asset value.
For details of the Companys derivative instruments exposure see Note 11 on page 46.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES As explained in Note 1 g on page 40 investments are shown at fair value which is the bid or last market price.
Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exception was the UK sterling denominated fixed rate unsecured loan, which was repaid on 26 January 2010.
2010 2009 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 5.435% per annum 27,416 27,000 FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY In 2009 the Accounting Standards Board amended FRS29 and requires financial companies to disclose the fair value hierarchy that classifies financial instruments measured at fair value at one of three levels according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values.
Classification Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the Accounting Policies Note 1 g on page 40.
All investments held by the Company as at 31 August 2010 are considered to fall within Level 1 with the exception of 2,185,000 of derivatives which fall within Level 2 and 86,000 of unlisted investments which fall within Level 3.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
The capital of the Company is disclosed in the Balance Sheet on page 37 and is managed in accordance with its investment policy in pursuit of its investment objective, both of which are detailed on pages 18 to 20 of the Directors Report.
The principal risks and their management are disclosed on pages 21 and 22.
20 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS There were no contingent liabilities or capital commitments as at 31 August 2010 2009: nil.
21 TRANSACTIONS WITH THE MANAGER The Directors have complied with the provisions of FRS8 which require disclosure of related party transactions and balances.
FIL Investments International is the Manager and Secretary of the Company and details of the services provided and fees paid are given on pages 24 and 25.
